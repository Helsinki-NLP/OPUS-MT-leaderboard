Welsh MPs don’t want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour representative explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means “dustete”, and pwp means “beach”.
A representative for the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and that they have suggested alternatives.
A representative for the Welsh section of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which, in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a “uh” sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the final say as to what name they are to be referred to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the authority to change its own name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public hearing that showed public support for renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives apparently suggest other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to the head of parliamentary president Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a draft legislation for the name change in the next few weeks.
The legislation surrounding the reform will include other changes to how the National Assembly functions, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the last right to vote on what they will be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the northern neighbor’s name be a claim on their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s silence – the cries of Harlem are struggling
“The old people I spoke to told me that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there’s none of the parts.”
He said the bar's apostasy was understandable.
“People interact with each other socially in other ways” these days, he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they are back to the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both creeks were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had lived nearby took over the building.
St. Martin’s received a black congregation under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem’s main shopping streets — because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly declared the carillon to be “the church bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church's lay leadership and others by the diocese.
The church council – the church’s leadership, made up of lay people – wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose costs” on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he thought at first that the boy was shouting out of enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was torn up,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its innings at Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth while sales figures for clothing and home items are falling. If the attempt proves successful, the concept will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use for the space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s has said they will double the number of beauty products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also have better space in branded areas, as well as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop is to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a new trend of buying small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods besides food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was discontinued after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 retail pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and design of our beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be so ready to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet every need, and the welcoming surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are now a beauty competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of a deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who is the host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-chain contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the TV goldsmith admitted that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean she no longer has time to spare for their clothing and accessory brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has decided to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the This Morning programme manager, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and cosplay, as well as a potential delay in launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Three-year-old Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business dealings.”
“We fell in love, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that some would consider “a bit presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having even declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen an “equivalent response” from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, continues to have sanctions aimed at keeping up the pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke in front of a crowd of his voters.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his work to improve relations with Kim has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to missile tests, helping to free hostages and to have the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have around 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia topple an island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok’s residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it absolutely clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Rescue the children now put together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national agency for crisis management, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia is facing, the country is horribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has likely contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia’s fallible infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for the Jokos administration, which will stand for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with a late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it towards the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball descended towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always sending the ball forward as best they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it away.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick pass in midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defence and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the Europa League in men's football in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s emergency management agency announced early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a bar of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to get in touch – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to question where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours to get back in.
A police officer was questioned when he told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She said, “It’s so horrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the lock, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the barricade and oversaw the apartment complex.
Individuals with information are asked to send an instant message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” as of September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial to be drawn into the dispute over "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick’s publishing house as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft’s stunning portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century views and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against outside pressure – in his day, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Deadly Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only referred to by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the door to a nearby pig path was open.
He said that inside the pig path there was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maltreated,” explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from surveillance cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
This is not the first time a pig has been reported to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer’s wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to the common, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They just play.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they are not trying to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rain on her journey through northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northwards toward the southwest of the United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical moisture and the approaching blizzard will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, liquid debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to become broad, roaring rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to local gusts that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching storm will cause heavy local rainfall for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be nearly 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are likely to have a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twentieth from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States will most likely have higher than normal temperatures throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread over six television networks, watched Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh was feeling her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewer counts were not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office employees.
To provide some perspective, this is the viewership corresponding to the playoffs of the American Football Championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion groups have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the networks, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting of the court committee while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes while being scolded, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling our country the truth?”
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a big impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of playing “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged with willful murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admits to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The medical examiner in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is stated as a gunshot wound to the head and through the throat.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police’s Refugee Recovery Task Force, the state police laboratory, Southern University Police, and the local people for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for its “hard work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "crushed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano splashes ash over Mexico City
The ash that sprouts from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Desastres, Mexico’s official disaster prevention agency, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in one day.
The agency monitored several cases of rumbling and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windscreens on cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote for secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit fighting.
For hours, independence protesters stood chanting “Never forget, never forgive,” face to face with unionist protesters chanting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to local press.
Tensions remain high in the liberation-oriented region a year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming turnout for secession, but there was poor turnout because the vote was boycotted by the majority who opposed the release.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties that support Catalan independence have struggled to keep the pressure up this year, as many of their elected leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict is fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed pending trial since late last year, announced he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30pm BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Infuriated Livinston stunned the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have still not won the away leg of the Premier League this season and will play against managers Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
The Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, for his part, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Chief coach Holt has not yet lost a game after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against its sluggish guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kicked forward after slipping in to face Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for their guests by deadballing.
And that’s how the ultimate goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a clear lead, and he scored a goal from the centre of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball mostly all the time, but the home team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide pass.
Cruises kept coming into the Livingston box and were constantly rescued, while two penalty claims – once after Halkett’s protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once at hand – were overlooked.
“Fenomenalt” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all together and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have barely changed since they made it back to the top, but Holt should have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a huge well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration.
Although they have at times been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs – they only made it into the home team’s half of the field once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also let themselves be heard, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy veil in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision comes just one month after a cyclist died in a collision where the driver escaped from the scene of the crime in Childrens Street, about one kilometer from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and notify the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident at a high-security men’s prison, according to the prison authorities.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized “Tornado” officers have been brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars and beatings.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to handle a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
Arizona is hit by a tropical depression, but that’s likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through the deserts of the southwest and carries flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm at some locations in the Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 137 km, is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and cause great flood danger.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with opportunities for up to 25 cm of precipitation,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low, which detter moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce deadly flooding and liquid debris and fast in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have mobile footage of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered under the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the pettyness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that he committed a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his charges during the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, skilled and courageous” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, with impeccable vandalism in public service,” he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
“I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats’ goal was to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate’s first mid-term vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant to a Republican party leader.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were pulled out to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves thundered in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their path and drove many into drowning death.
The tsunami hit the heels of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami danger arose yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Crisis Management Agency (BNBP), told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it took cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape from the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Emergency Management Agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and smashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be the country's larger coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes thundering against the beach, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's totally cruel.
World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in downtown Palu, where they have sought shelter under tarpaulin in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed through major destruction on the way, according to Doseba Sinai.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's totally cruel.
As aid organizations began the grim preparations for delivering emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the borders to international aid, but the situation has not been given any status yet.”
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that light up the gloomy news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued by rescuers after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival in Palu.
But the messages only led to gray chin marks, rather than a few blue chin marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “runs up behind the Brink’s employee” and steals a money bag to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspected escapees from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation previously known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on an “emotional basis,” according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s incoming president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when leftist student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support could double the chance of the next major performance in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a head of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be held, to help find the next generation's wise minds.
Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should be offered a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s Cabinet of Ministers issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the US law that aims to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their bid to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has vetoed including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts about whether the turnout will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Even if it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a large enough number of Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said it had not received any reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country’s name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
“We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will be reported with a raised head, not be let in the back way,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we deserve ours.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become a member of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He says a “yes” answer will be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of those who responded plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced with three Brighton defenders before making his way out onto the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacking player used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was fortunate that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball into Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before leading Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacking player sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is a spoiler for the Rockies.
The Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The always equal-competition Scherzer still hopes to stand on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies won a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Although we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what will most likely be the highest level of combat I get to play at this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to take Scherzer pitcher in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games and lost 7 this season, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president quietly referred to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power at any cost, and there you see the petty and the mean.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and prevent.”
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “sinful and mean and ugly and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, upon which the audience bowed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m expecting one — it was very bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who speak their mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On how important it is to have responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar things that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
At the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, friendlier” politics is long forgotten, if it ever began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the Party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, whether they were about the nation’s security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I get a bunch of nasty messages on social media demanding that I be deposed, condemning center politics and telling me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter an ocean that gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never lets themselves be cowed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross squandering has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every no-confidence motion and every change in the electoral rules makes the party narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years where I am encouraged to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better”.
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school I attended being literally bankrupt, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country races our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it’s to those I represent, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of resignation or political uncompromisingness will prevent me from doing what I believe best serves your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastically entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, there was just as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led to the home team losing the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
“We have been challenged in our matches so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy about that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All credit to Ayr, they were better off taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute goal kick from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the position, and Jason Baggot performed a goalless try.
Climo strengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before, just before the break, scoring and scoring a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on stretchers, and from the restart Ayr management increased even more an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by pitching behind the advancing Ayr mouth.
Climo performed a goal kick, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
The Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be entering the food service industry – it was recently discovered that he has been named CEO of a restaurant company with a grant.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, for which he writes scripts and plays alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the case, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia still vividly remembers the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to be able to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has drive, a spirit of community and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice ruling on the big screen in many different parts of the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will pass its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also staked a lot on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia’s party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, as the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the latest arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than having promoted Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that Morales’ antagonistic rhetoric has eroded any remaining goodwill on Chile’s part.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will provide “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favor of both parties”.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political shack.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we need to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Unless It Can Trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can’t trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the pledges it made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch the stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
U.S. officials are sceptical to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to release an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of weird, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel lions at the Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat, or even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had revived lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the last scream.
One creation was reminiscent of diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading towards a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight to the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another big creation down the catwalk – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffie bag, edged with raffie fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the fashion week in Paris.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – once the designer has made such an impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s free schools continue to exhibit academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another year of excellent exam results. These are underpinned by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and in-demand elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest percentages of attendance from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the examination grade A.
The data, obtained from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council, showed that 72 percent of students received the examination grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now valued at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons employers cited for having difficulty holding a vacant position, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter which career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teach in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable to the UK on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from at free schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is constantly crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to Scotland’s youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he has to play has not yet been determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
The president is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five planned rallies over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court nominee is on hold, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote has been put on hold for up to one week while the FBI investigates the case.
With the main goal of all these referendums is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five rallies over the next few weeks are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The evening’s rally, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science expert at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep the faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed this year.
Momentum’s swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They led by six points and now there are four, so we probably carry that with us as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said as he left the field for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel like they’ve gotten some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebratory screams grew louder as his round continued, and sank to a crucial putting to raise the match to a draw as he and Thomas were two under after two.
His putting, who won them the game at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows he still doesn’t believe the U.S. team is hopeless.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is undoubtedly Ryder Cup’s big success story.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t set a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience would rather see secure a European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily broke up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swedish were so far behind that they had no chance to catch the lead.
On Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn around in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is well ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 10–6 at the start of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup final day, after finishing Sunday’s four-balls and foursomes matches with 10–6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins against a downed Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European side, fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America’s unfortunate side in the morning fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two matches, but they did not catch any of the lead.
Jim Fury's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they teamed up seamlessly to beat down Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two games on Saturday, blinked occasionally but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and performed a 2-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and third worldwide.
But Europe didn’t get everything they wanted on this hot day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the majors three times, set the standard for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to recover after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders only Furyk's side need to reach a tie to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn’t look like they’ll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea 'in no way' to agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened mistrust of the United States and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general meeting that North Korea has carried out “significant benevolence measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done previously.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ and raises pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as stalled as it is.”
The tone of Ri’s speech, however, was very different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland United States with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work still remains and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of making “gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile range and a nuclear plant if the United States took “similar action.”
He said Kim had said these “similar measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing culture of puking through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often didn’t have a clue how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important it is with good sleep habits to be able to perform academically and athletically, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dorm room, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking,” Professor Czeisler said.
There is still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study program before enrolling at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to go to bed as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from the away audience.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have loved how his well-trained team beat opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goal bar.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos believed he should have had a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson denied this.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Liv’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the final, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had a late claim to the penalty kick as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture through the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Let’s say it’s making noise now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave his name to lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine being tested has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced ovarian cancer she suffered from disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab so they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of various cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and "trained" to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was inducted into the Saturday Night Live studio after a harrowing performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he lunged out to the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's recording was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headwear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat on.”
They bullied me!
And then they said I don’t understand what reality is,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want me to understand what reality is?” he said, saying that he should “put on my Superman cape, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.”
His comments were rebuffed at least twice, and the staff at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one staff member telling: “The whole studio went silent.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR standing up to the masses.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art” which I believe cultivates and ejects ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg is known as Snoop Lion, after the late Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendants are expected to be produced before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for "gifty masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about the subject.
“It worries me a lot these days – where did the masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How did we raise men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have some of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to its strongly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is innate and what is intended?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel like they have to cultivate this very side of being a man?
I think it’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because it’s clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any predecessor or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “finished with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the filming, so that’s how something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit’s character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, the health representative said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, eventually marry women.
A lot of the disease is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked data on Republican senators, whispers of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat instigated by the allegations was voiced by “ultra-conservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and a outright lie,” Waters continued.
“The members of my staff – who have had their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and a outright lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be aggressive.
They must not defend themselves.
They must not doubt the prosecutor's motives.
They must act calmly and sensibly.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “relevant authorities and police of these false allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in Spy Parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit references in all new films with a British twist and it seems to be relevant to this revival of the parodifranchis Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-emerged in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has renewed his license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions is a mix of Clouseau, a dash Mr Bean and a portion of that guy who contributes a single note to the music scene with the fire truck theme during the opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard; the traveler and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It’s a great moment in Johnny English’s life.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to his senses, but the humor feels rather bloodthirsty and strangely superfluous, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly have elements of comedy removed.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s faders aren’t as inventive and pointed as the silent film lies in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarding agent – a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the final drop for a prime minister, a pompous and downtrodden figure already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Theresa May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she has to pick up some of the retired ones.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbish establishment, but provides unofficial teaching in secret. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rocka academy for spy activity.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, tormented helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, squandered with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on mission for the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's fantastic femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farcical side-scrolls: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, creating chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovable and noisy there is so much that reminds of children's TV with the whole thing.
Very mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies they are working out plans to let the British work four-day week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is to consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra weekday off.
This will result in employees getting a three-day weekend, while getting the same pay.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing in the workers’ favor – as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not party policy and is not something that is being considered by the party.”
John McDonnell, Labour’s finance policy spokesman, used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “faceless CEOs” and “profits” of public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back the entire shareholding because a Labour government can make “deductions” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity to private sector companies to employees, which can receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' about FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, oblique, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice appears to have been cut in stone.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would have to be a startling finding,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could confirm that.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring thousands of people to the Great Plains of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a variety of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, taking a phone call, or other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are now only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million “shares” from supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to show 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The Group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main engagements are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK that will “help children realize their full potential”, and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy as ‘Blocked’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate about energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The U.S. has through the Navy the ability to make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit that profiles itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far from the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project The Northern European Gas Pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Northern European gas pipeline, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think seriously” about running for president after the midterm elections.
During an election rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaky government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will be seriously considering running for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the vote, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried all the way to the margin of what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election campaign
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them,” she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is the respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, silencing with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from the amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang members’ sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Court of Appeals for immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy “regards many decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” the statement from the amicus curiae said.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the U.S. economy and says there is a high probability that they will become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in the June 11 announcement on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her feverish son at an evacuation center in the cramped city of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents could be seen coming to destroyed homes and roaming through water-damaged properties in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears come to his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “harassing” with “propaganda ads”
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper denouncing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the attachment China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s early trade war punitive tariffs would hit export firms in states such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader’s note in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are exploiting the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you will not find many dissenting opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese about China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, even though he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fad, analysts warn
As many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple allegations of sexual assault directed at him, analysts warn that they will get a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI investigation at the last second will be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget yesterday’s events – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the aisles of the Senate as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among women insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a blissful mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval, or whether Kavanaugh will be inducted — it’s also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the aftermath of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents were fully or fairly convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh’s making.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake play, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had abused her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where their data is to be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data storage online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company will provide with the resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project, and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don’t talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not they’re going to introduce something completely new, which will make their business models completely revamp overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross Recipient of the First World War
The only priest in the English Church who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “great symbolism” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed into the firing line and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field gun on his own and knocking out three of the detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to play a role in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans were up all night to watch the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead getting the Peppa Pig
Imagine that you’ve stayed up all night to watch the tightly packed Bellator 206, only to discover that you won’t be able to watch the main game.
The San Jose entrant made it through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the UK were stunned when the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after staying up until early morning to watch the game.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to the children’s program as “a kind of sick joke.”
“It’s state regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on the broadcast plan to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we went over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly sort.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a government thing.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school that he realized “he wasn’t like the others.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for gay rights to give other "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular program manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is due to be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a bit lost on Laverne’s first broadcast and said he felt “less valuable” than anyone else he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man — filmmaker Dustin Lance Black of the United States, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” – he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsweak Mickelson taken out for the Ryder Cup golf tournament Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to get in shape if it’s not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and foursome matches.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major-winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working his game on the rank in the hopes of fixing what’s crumbling.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area still punishes stray strokes.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Fury expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood what role he had today, slapped me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams before, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I thought more, but that’s how it ended, and that’s how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to hang out with others, he’s a great guy to have in the warehouse,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too and it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the start of last day’s singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but clinched the victory with the least possible margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only to the point,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You will give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very happy with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements are at the heart of it, and it’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, your accomplishments as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players that they need to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, his opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals last day, joining the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the “miracle at Medinah”.
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the player order.
“I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The German Navy’s newest frigate was supposed to have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it won’t happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major post-delivery problems pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy ordered all the way back in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It has been agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
However, ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships – which were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated before they are put into service.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels were to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous excess weight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy’s ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class that were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag on the entire project – including crew training – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government’s defence committee, confirmed that the navy actually “goes empty for usable ships.”
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of service, but no new vessels arrived.
He regrets that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats, as well as brownlings and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and which species do what.
Then, a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be introduced, for example, to plant grazing land and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects breeding grounds and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with flypaper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road as they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only own bat reserve at the Threeve land estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threeave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property since the inadvertent destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps devastate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as “fake news” and says people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 afterwards for keeping a close eye on the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the allegations as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable portrayal of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the footballer will seek compensation for “recognition damages to an extent commensurate with the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents presented to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they entered into a settlement outside the court because she was "scared of revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly hanged".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will mourn forever' over loss of automakers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, see production at our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “order as required”, and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day’s stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such border controls.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallais, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “exposed for another week” as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian meddling in the election, connections between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy justice minister or not, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has for many months tempered speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to retire voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s postponement because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmer Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to “self-compassion” of TV reporters, although she added: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they are self-sufficient.”
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
“The president is doing more rounds of questioning than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We’re trying to get it done often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he was conducting a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland EU workers on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been taking place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution by the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to repeat now how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and enhances the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennesseean newspaper.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
“He came out on the sidelines and sort of just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is “no information on the type/scope of the damage yet” and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters.
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success plan to attract young voters with the promise of offering more affordable housing and targeting high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The profit – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate that was introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May have to reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling array of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unfounded ejections.
He also wants to give the city councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too remote, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club event.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not afraid to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League.”
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief appearance on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third division and helped St Mirren from the brink of relegation to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real roadblock,” he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
“I really thought management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I’m progressing through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels just right to me.

The summer heatwave has boosted revenue for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July – while restaurant revenues fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than what restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had a hard time with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food service down 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales on the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-awaited respite.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, study finds
A survey of 20,000 high school students uncovered pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to picture sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, which was conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Principals’ Conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ on Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience on the international nvi<0xC3><0xA5> over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletic community and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will enjoy bringing her on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after suffering a transient ischemic attack she was unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be restored and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely well again and have learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad that compares mothers with cows splits public opinion online
A breast pump company has split public opinion online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump to be worn tightly against the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump brings to active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t understand it, this is not swear, it’s my tits”.
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my buns.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it paints the “cruelties” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “What a failed ad.”
Others defend the ad. One woman admitted that she thinks the song is “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I wish I had one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits nicely into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognisable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of detained migrant children has gone up even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children among supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have themselves been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking to be supporters of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people,” says Albence.
The officers are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days that was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be produced via videoconferencing instead of appearing in person to conduct their case for a residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered to be unwarranted asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who are struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupational powers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under cover of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more are fleeing.
He said Damascus would continue to “conduct this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” both for terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that makes refugees stay away.
“We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defensive position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put forward conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump Wants to Win Another Period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of viewership.
Since 2014, viewership for prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why, she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Exit is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “depth in background material” for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (“a garment brimmed with hybris,” the Washington Post said, “and the consequences of that.”
I don’t want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
“One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s varying cast and daily twist on the plot.
You can’t miss one episode or you’ll be left hanging.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh is to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
“I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flood of money after a congressional district conversion that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-retired suburban district of Pittsburgh is running with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb faces another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were a unconstitutional manipulation of the constituencies in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the largest party funding groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely watched supplementary election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
The United States considered punitive measures against El Salvador for support of China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the punitive measures were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed punitive measures, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting all plans for punitive action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be placed in charge of that body, in the middle of preparations to meet voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakians at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points right now.
What will we do if Trump kicks out Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hard weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secret wiretaps of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the recently launched FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is cleared to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the chin cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded in the end, but a draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd in my back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the substitutions in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and get it done.”
Women lose their night’s sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to take that call,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t say what you want well in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how care is to be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Get rid of legal issues right away.
Get a health representative in place by appointing a person you trust to oversee your medical care, and making sure that health care workers will comply with your wishes if you were to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in a summary so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he was on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "unmotivated act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have been searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communications are out of service, and rescue workers have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region below provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Sulawesi's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency management.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck inland from the south coast, killing nearly 700.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, silencing a report of domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su custody and is being held for an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He was produced before the court on Saturday, where he pleaded “not guilty, absolutely” when asked how he came to grips with the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be heard in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, silencing with the report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-service PTSD in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terror attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he meowed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm with intent, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the case file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with money extortion, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and vehicle wreckage.
The attack required “significant planning and intent,” the prosecutor said, describing the way Saipov performed it as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused personal injury, property damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", stated.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could bring the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty after the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been wiped out” if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go ahead with trying to get a deal with Brussels despite the setback – forcing Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I want to stand up for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan.”
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are tearing down the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “State ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would “feel the pressure” if they thought about betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is about trust between us – the people – and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilising the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app as the conference began.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have been using the town hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to come to Washington to fix our flawed government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene carrying weapons, admitting to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and placed in custody by East Baton Rouge Parish police officers.
Sims was a two-meter-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for world title after stalling order gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stall order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost swept Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels which made the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double pass to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in at number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race as he lay on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He finally reached the depot in the 44th round, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to get a good two-team,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a police briefing on Saturday for her contention that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what happened in the Senate shows that people are “ugly, ugly, and speaking falsely.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and ugly and talk nonsense,” he said.
“When you look at extraditions and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I haven’t done that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven’t been leaking.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We were leaking ... no, we weren’t leaking,” he added, mimicking the senator’s voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for.”
But her denial was not taken kindly by the president, who commented during the party event on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie lined up for the home team before Dwyer restored management for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come a long way after beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford retired when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's five half-way out in the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Air Passengers Escape Earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as having died and ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely lighten up.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved many hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-meter-high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that a man was missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all of them was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a pier also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lays out timeline for night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the case on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone prints to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted what he had previously claimed, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambers’s phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness box on Saturday and claimed he wasn’t in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer for Sanford that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my trailer was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records suggest they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
According to the plan, the defense will begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-engaged hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Babysitter in New York sues couple for termination after ‘racist’ message
A New York City babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misdirected message from their mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racist, and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who fired Maurice, claiming that their aborted babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the termination and demands compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month, lodging-based arrangement she was promised, albeit without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that — hey, you just don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have backed down on accusations that they are racist and say Maurice's resignation was the only right thing to do, as they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racist,” Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you’d been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Let's go."
Plasco’s comparison of the lawsuit to “extortion” says Plasco was because his wife only had two months to term and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” added the stockbroker.
As the legal case progresses, the People’s Court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington’s publisher feared readers wouldn’t accept a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s shoes when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write the children’s book by a small cloth bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned down. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “bittersweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn’t a boastful person,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even if it’s not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she says.
“I looked down all the time and tears flowed in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and took his own life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his own life.
Sharon says: “I worry all the time that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
“Don’t talk to yourself, you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost her partner Mark through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changing mood.
On the first day of Christmas he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight their way through it: “It tears up a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
We all have to stand up and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Hangs in a Thin Wire as FBI Begins Investigating
“I thought that if we could get to anything he asked for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — maybe we could come to some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee “fell apart” along locked party lines.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
The disappointment was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans are likely to do poorly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around to senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to use his double vote and have him impeached in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors “falls” under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Collection, said there had been 1,127 bounces last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices for human traffickers, were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most defectors from North Korea will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with force.
The relationship between North and South – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the stalled denuclearization talks.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost yelling and crying when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony shows he can't sit on the Supreme Court since it shows he's biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he sits in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the interrogation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overrule certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It’s a righteous anger, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was great.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and was grabbed in the neck collar by an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and they’ll be happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on her husband aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing wrong with investigating the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was nearing the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind with the funding and swore she wouldn’t run if she didn’t get $2 million in.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount, or what?” she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – that she collapsed into tears.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking maybe what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The main escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Of course, Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently with a five to ten percent surcharge on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match U.S. attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy probably won’t lift the white flag at first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the U.S. would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States could provide a positive outcome for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ripple effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have realized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to restore the country, which has been razed after more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now arranged for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe have won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during much of the tournament, avoided his tee shots in the water at par-3 16th holes, and had to watch himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current layout in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most successful European in history with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to have the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could be of help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely as he grew up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves out.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to look ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their team captain.
All you have to do is take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
