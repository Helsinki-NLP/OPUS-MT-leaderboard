A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the road system, many are looking at its solution in a small black box, which fits neatly on the dashboard of your car.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor-driver and communicates that information to the authorities, is now a controversial effort for the Washington and State Planning Offices to reinvigorate the old system to finance America's major roads.
In general, boring work like highway planning has also suddenly become a matter of deep debate and living alliances.
Keeping track of the miles driven by you, and possibly the locations driven - and then using this information to prepare a tax bill - has gotten the Liberal environmental groups in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is sloppy.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver pays for every mile decided on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which has GPS monitoring.
This is a very important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of us choosing or not choosing," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Union, which plans to begin tracking every mile decided by motorists in California by 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way taxes are paid by us.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has almost gone bankrupt, financed by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by US citizens.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The car now travels more miles in a gallon of gas than ever before.
There has been no increase in the federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Politicians avoid raising even a penny in taxes because of the high price of gas.
Li Munikh, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, "Gas tax is not transportable at all."
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will act as the most rational option."
Winx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, because it can, for example, change the way cars are run--and change the taxes, which can help to reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners are eager for this system while developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip. Bill Shuster (A.-PA) also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors at the Region Foundation are also in favour of paying per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region, said, "It's not just about doing what's going on in the dark well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who had graced the move towards per-mile payments from Congress in their 2011 report.
The U.S. Senate had approved a $90-million test project last year that included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural law-makers, who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to the city on a daily basis, the House leadership ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers a short time ago, the driver was very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and operational management in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says, "Worry about Big Brother and the like was a major problem."
It’s not something that people want.
As the trial progressed, Nevada's ACLU had warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert this device into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanageable technology framework-structure, which would necessarily have to be spread out to keep a record of each person's daily commute.
Nevada is one of many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is running per day, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing was well liked by highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they will be more willing to adopt this approach,"" said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Milez."
Some major mistakes have been made in these early programmes of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving different options to drivers.
They can choose the device of G.P.S. with or without G.P.S.
Or again, no one can choose not to take the device, but can choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience in the device rather than less.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate paying the parking meter fee, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect real-time data from other drivers that the trucker will use to collect speed data from.
The city planning document mentions, “Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it because of the benefits it brings.”
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion on payment according to miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that the Congress can deal with the problem of the bankruptcy highway trust fund very easily by increasing the gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other cars whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their fair share.
Randy Rentscheler, the Commission's legislative and public affairs director, said, "What is the need for absolute surgery when aspirin can work?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
According to the police, he died of drowning.
Incidentally, his friend has been taken into custody by the police on charges of concealing the late goods with him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation into the death to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in the Jhelum Sea.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone of the deceased and Sim were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Solara.
The woman said the phone was given to her by a relative, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in the pastoral garden and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone swimming in Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the luggage on the edge, while Ruhail went to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he only had clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid, but he did not find him.
On this he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and put them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that he had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid's death was caused by drowning and was also confirmed in the postmortem.
Incidentally, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 for concealing the facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly secretive manner.
This was revealed by his family friend, Marcel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teen activist in the Forza Italia party.
It is there that France, whose relationship was being said to be a mere show of their relationship with Balrusconi, is.
A close friend of Berlusconi's and Bunga-Bunga girl, Marcel Polanco, has revealed that he too was invited to this secret marriage.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
In a revelation on Italian Radio2, when asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco has said that the two are already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former Prime Minister's house.
Besides, no one can say anything.
However, she did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his greetings to the newlyweds.
The couple got married on October 8 or 9 about three weeks ago.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old woman named Francesca Pascal was engaged to her.
Berlusconi had laid the groundwork for the loneliness behind his decision to avoid Kerry.
Rains continued to fall in the lower parts of the country amid the eye of the sun.
With this, the cold war has begun in the entire plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, -0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic due to rain and snowfall.
There is heavy snow on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the mountainous areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activeness of the western tremors, a period of heavy rains began in the high-altitude areas of the plaintiff and in the low-altitude areas, which continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People stayed indoors to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply in many areas was also disrupted.
The maximum temperature of Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius below normal.
In Jammu, too, the night has been getting colder due to heavy rains and heavy winds.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was recorded at 16.6 and a maximum of 27.0°C.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the western quake has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Srinagar-based Meteorological Department director Sonam Lotes, the weather is likely to remain dry in the plaintiff from 1st November to 1st November.
Asaram, who was jailed on charges of sexual harassment, was again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage advocated by Asaram, he is being presented as a blood-drinking Dracula of children, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Satsivam refused to order the media to stop running news about Asaram, saying it had seen every word reported in the media and there was no reason for it to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer alleged to the media that he was showing more and more news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not swayed by these pleas and refused to interfere in the matter saying they had more options.
Earlier, the court had also rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case to date.
The group manager of the mall cut the TDS and paid it to the financial institutions concerned, but did not pay it to the government treasury.
In doing so, the TDS was depositing the money to itself.
The team, which came from Mumbai on October 17, had taken action together with the Jaipur exploration team.
The investigation of the same link revealed that this trader has cut the TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team had launched an income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
There was a risk of account being sealed about 15 days ago on the group of this mall manager to conduct searches and surveys.
Angry at the move, the businessman has made it clear to income tax officials that they are not yet ready to pay the TDS to the income tax department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action against them.
The investigating authorities have clarified that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
Due to Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
In view of this, the sale of low and fake mauve increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical-laden sweets.
The department seized 70,000 Mawa from Madhya Pradesh and 5,000 from Quetta Colony.
With the rise in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for malt from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The information department has received information from the Nagpur police station about the presence of Ghatia Mave in the rubbish.
Mawa's Kheep Nagpur is being procured from the transport garage.
The department took possession of the mauve, which was priced at Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not entitle anyone to the right to bear.
The department declared the property as unclaimed (undisclosed) property and destroyed it.
The department recovered about 5,000 shimmers after raiding the Jitendra caterers in Quetta Colony.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to lighten the glow and stay in place for a longer period of time.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, the assistant commissioner of the department, said that the campaign of chemical-based sweets and the seizure of garnished and fake mauve will continue.
In the next few days, information on the operation and acceleration has been provided by the department.
The consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make good milk from sweets, mawes.
The department has appealed to the people to be wary of fake sweets and muffins.
The 42 senior BJP leaders, who were elected by the state, made a strong push at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for a visit to the BJP-led Santtana Yatra.
The Santtana Yatra is an exercise to appease the family members of those killed in the blasts in Patna on behalf of the BJP.
It is noteworthy that a total of seven blasts took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's "Hunkar" rally.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts intended to launch a brawl during the rally, so that more people were injured and an atmosphere of terror was created in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party's leaders have been travelling from their village to Ashti-Kalsh since Thursday.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will be flowing together in the Ganga in Patna.
This is part of the comforting journey.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
They will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 a.m. on Saturday and meet their families.
During this gift-mulakata, they will also provide a cheque of five to five rupees to the relatives of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial aid.
The Indian team, which had won the last match, will take on Australia in the seventh and final ODIs at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, with a goal to capture the series with a win.
India had to win Nagpur One Day in any recent event to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain and its batsmen gave it a record win by performing explosively, making the team equal to 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved a target of more than 350 runs and once again the responsibility to cross the team's naia will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the bigger target is also proving to be gloomy in front of him.
While Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have high hopes for the team.
As far as the opening is concerned, the team as Rohit and Shikhar have got such an open pair which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure, making a fantastic partnership in the opening.
Virat Kohli, who has so far performed at number three, is being hailed as the Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
But many cricket pandits have described him as better than Sachin.
The 25-year-old Virat has scored 17 ODI centuries next week, out of which India has won 16.
Pursuing the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but these three can also be detrimental to the highly dependent team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a case, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work for them 'lifeline'.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
He is also seeking to be included in the Test squad for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia have a good batsman up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voggs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Heung and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling could be a big factor for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
Dr Jitendra Singh, a member and chief spokesperson of the BJP National Executive, said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists in the guise of peace.
Citing intelligence agencies reports, Singh said in a statement released here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing for a full-scale infiltration of terrorists ready for 2000 in its training camps.
He will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has been even more baffled by the separatists' misgivings about the massive deterioration of the situation by inciting people in Kashmir.
Citing last year's visit to Pakistan by separatists, the BJP leader said ISIS chief Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's sargana Hafeez Saeed and Saeed Salahudin had assured that terrorism would be allowed in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to delivering on this promise.
The killing of soldiers at the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of the same strategy.
Describing the demand to abolish the privileges of the army in the state as deadly, the BJP leader said such things are also against the people as long as there is lasting peace in the state.
This gives rise to anti-national elements.
He stressed that the statements of the leaders of the army, the security forces should be stopped.
Snow Dane ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, the U.S. intelligence informant, has announced that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond to his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr. Snow Dane in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to speak about the testimony in Germany.
The MP, in a letter submitted by Mr. Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government accepts the dissent as a party - a change, and does not provide any defence that violates the political rhetoric with accusations of insurgency."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dan said he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice's charges include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit online: "Mr. Snow Dane is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been bugging.
Thomas Oberman, MP who is chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence information. said that if as a witness there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snow Dan Kosunen "without completely destroying relations with the United States and putting them at risk," then it should also be taken.
Shreestroh Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of herself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter.
He said that two German journalists were on their way to Russia.
According to a former NSA contractor lawyer, Snow Dane is not able to go back to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there which would require assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that he had to leave the house because he had to "face a fierce and constant campaign."
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by the widespread reactions "to his work of political expression."
The United States, including the world's citizens as well as senior officials, has estimated the secrecy of an irresponsible system of widespread surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German officials "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carrier - Charges for on-board baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to carry goods for passengers on its flight board - on-store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for a carry-on bag for $100 and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can keep the full box.
The new carry-on is for bags in overhead bins, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said that if $25 is paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if the passenger waits to pay as long as they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee has to be earned to take care of the charge in advance of the passengers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
The airline started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are charging as much as they can carry-on luggage that is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means there is often less space in this compartment.
The fee is a way to bring passengers on board for less.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charges.
It's becoming increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the Overhead Bin's place.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay for it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a front gate can get one bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
The new carry of Frontier - on fees, will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often show dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other charges, but the airline service likes them.
They argue that baggage costs money to handle, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The cost of luggage on Wall Street is seen by many as an indication that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them don't even have a carry-on bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began carrier-on-tariff for the first time three years ago, and partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
With such a fee as well as other airline Hungary's Wizz Air, which the airline's consultant J Sorensen said, and who does the add-on fee tracking.
He said Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines, recently flew in Spirit and surprised passengers who had to carry an unusual bag fee at the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and see out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he said it climbed lickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier well that the traveler who will take the soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and this free coffee will give for only once.
It will still give away water.
The U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months later after the passengers complained they withdrew and followed up with no other major airline after being there.
If Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline then this step of Frontier's to charge a fee on Carry-on is its fresh attempt to operate customers towards its own website.
The airline pays the online travel seller Orbitz for such a $10 to $25 ticket each sold.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many frequent fly-miles began to pay for half of those customers who had purchased from an online travel agency from these individuals.
On Wednesday, it lowered the mileage award by 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the only passengers when buying directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier's Denver has a loyal customer base in its home city, but its business is shrinking and it's losing money.
The 9% decline in revenue and its flight capacity has been reduced by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republicans are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the airline.
N.S.A. Accuses ‘Internal Error’ Instead of Hackers for Website Crash
The Secret National Security Agency said on Friday that our website had been shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiencies, not because of hackers as some people had claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight, which was due to an internal error occurring during the pre-determined update," the agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that this obstacle, the distributed denial of service [DDOS] came due to the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not in reach for some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that there was "absolutely no" agreement with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by DDOS attack.
The DDOS attack is designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unexploited and the purpose of the attacks is not to discriminate the internal network of the target system.
Former highly mysterious N.S.A., which was never named "No such agency" by the extremity of the extremity and the extremity of the extremity of the extremity in the last few months, has become the subject of much discussion and bitter criticism among the common people - which is collectively expressed.
Due to such growing controversy about the agency, speculations were made after the incident tonight that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the narrative of 'One more Dronacharya' showing harmony in today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path by tying in which fetters.
The play was co-launched by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice-President of the Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The drama depicts the Dronacharya of the Dover era and the similarity of the circumstances of a professor Arvind at present.
In the play directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. performed brilliantly with the characters.
The play was directed by Jitendra C. Raj and directed by Hemant Kumar.
Following this, various awards were given to the luminaries who made literary, cultural and cultural contributions on behalf of Apta.
The award was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Urdu department president of Charan Singh Vivi, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and color activist Jitendra C Raj.
Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi, etc. were among the officials who contributed to the success of the event.
Bombardier's profits fall as delivery of aircraft, orders fall
Canada's aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its rail unit and in the form of pressure from lower aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also did not offer an update on issues related to the release of any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or its ambitious program to go into commercial service from September next.
About a month and a half ago after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flown only three times, raising the question of whether or not the test phase is on track.
The result fell below the forecast and the shares have been sent for more than 8 percent slides in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with the National Bank Financials, on Thursday downgraded its rating to "field performance" from "mat" to "field performance" as the stock is limited over the next one or two quarters.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new order for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the market program will be suspicious.
Bombardier expects the airline family to now be able to cut it at the bottom of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Prospective buyers are waiting for the result of the flight test to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as per the CSeries's firm order up to Medium 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time it first brought the jet into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going according to schedule.
"The test aircraft stayed on the ground longer than predicted," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that it was also scheduled during the ground test and software update interval of the aircraft.
Every manufacturer creates a schedule in a different way.
We have decided to take a first flight and have an updated period and said what we have done.
That is why everything will happen through the flight program.
The rest of the five test aircraft are expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Still, analysts suspect customers could start a CSeries aircraft operation in the first 12 months after their first flight.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the Service in Entry (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our view that the service at the entrance will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues plunged from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that a year earlier, down from 57, 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but lower order consumption and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenue fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, revenue in the division grew by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transportation unit were backlogs of $32.6 billion on or about September 30, up from a modest December 31.
Some major contracts in the margin of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
Executive officials said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
In Bombardier's shares, which included Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pickett's board of directors, were also down 8.5 percent in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday at C$4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
You don't lie to anyone and the idea of stealing or cheating doesn't come to mind.
But as soon as the evening comes, our mind changes and we start to walk against the norm to set the ideal aside.
In this research, researchers from Harvard University and the David Ackles School of Business at Utah have provided many interesting facts.
According to the researchers, while not stressing work in the morning, we favor moral values, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or more pressure in the evening.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
The point was to tell people that the point was higher on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
The experiment found that those who were used between 8 a.m. and 12 a.m. made no mistakes and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting on people between 12 noon and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately gave the wrong answer by putting their solutions on hold.
This has led researchers to prove that the lust for money does not make any difference to our honesty in the morning, but as soon as the evening comes, we stop giving morals a try.
The research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robberies, the accused fled away from the spot.
The injured have been admitted to the hospital in serious condition.
Son Sohanveer, a resident of Madhi village, has recently retired from the post of sub engineer from the power department.
On Wednesday, he was on his way home from the syndicate bank's Bhola branch with Rs 44,000.
Two bikers riding from behind on the Bhola-Madhi road stole 44 thousand cash from the beautiful man.
Sunder protested when the thugs shot him in the stomach, which injured him.
The family members and villagers rushed him to the Meerut hospital in critical condition.
No report could have been filed in the case till the time of writing of the news.
Three days ago, Jasveer, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot dead by two bikers while returning home from the same bank.
Apart from this, the police have not been able to disclose many other recent cases.
Here, S.O. Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents would be disclosed soon.
When the hotel staff protested, the assault began.
The son of the late MP, who came to the rescue along with the hotel owner's younger brother RK Singh, started the robbery.
Meanwhile, many more came.
When he tried to catch the young man, he fired from the revolver.
The fire has spread to the area.
The hotel staff rushed to the spot and called the police.
Arriving at the police station, hotel owner Munna Singh filed a report against Gorakhnath Pandey's son Anand Pandey, a resident of the Berwa Paharpur police station in Bhadohi district.
The police arrested him and seized the gunman.
According to Inspector Ashok Saraswat, a Khabhor resident of Pratapgarh, Munna Singh runs a hotel called Rag Darbar on the National Highway.
Anand Pandey arrived at the hotel around 8 pm and ordered food.
When he was late for food, he started gali-glauz, beating and firing.
Anand was intoxicated and even threatened to kill the hotel staff.
The inspector says the hotel is near the village of Bhati and is situated from Bhadohi district.
Mr. Big has been jailed for giving secret information about the police investigation to cocaine addict
The 42-year-old Bashrat Ditta had informed the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people might find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The top advocate of the defence, who told Mr. Big about the Chief Police investigation, because he was afraid people would find out about his secret addiction to his drug, has been jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after agreeing to his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough.
This advocate, who was nicknamed "Bash" and was praised by the offenders as "Top Brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 in Scarborough after the police surveillance operation, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
The 32-year-old Scarborough was seen holding three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues went out for a law society dinner.
Investigations after finding cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, her wallet, and her credit card revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of Category A drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Mercedeside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people who were sent to jail after the police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 worth of cash, during several raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta provided information to the criminals, as she was afraid that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackband, was found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court. Kary was arraigned in the Liverpool Crown Court today
He had admitted to having cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad times of the lawyer began when while investigating Scarborough, the police learned that he had been in regular contact with Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two spies chased the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and holding more than 60 per cent purity drug under the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glow.
Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta on the phone after the drug was placed, who went out for dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer reached the house, he found out that the drug had been placed there and there had been a conversation between them nine times.
The court heard that Ditta had been found a "regular user" of cocaine in the test when he was found to have a trace of a class A drug on her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to a suspicious dealer because he was his client and said his discussion was a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to withdraw his wallet and remove many credit cards, but they were seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In a police interview, she said that she ran the office from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients called her home for legal matters.
After being told by the main persons arrested what the spies knew about them, the court said in the hearing that Ditta used to call the leading people of the drug supply chain, some of whom she had previously presented a case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "The criminal lawyer should know best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his post as a criminal lawyer, associating too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a general drug dealer, but rather about a dealer who is providing his lawyer with a drug.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his own line of attorney-client relationship.
He interfered as much as possible with the investigation of the police so that they remained able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made a lot of closeness to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his freedom to contract.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent of the Lancashire Police Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta, at the same time that he started receiving drugs from organized criminals, turned himself into a criminal lawyer."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made a very compromise and became much weaker towards the objectives of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to get important information related to the police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of truthfulness, and fill people with confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta has cheated with this belief and has tried to avoid his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, who was also found guilty of three incidents of possession of cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the offenders to court.
This case should serve as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from the reach of law.
We will search you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the group were sent to prison for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the US, to be his dinner guest and to inspire inequality for his work.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said, "It's a terrible place, and it's legitimate to ask: what's to stop Parliament from taking away the judiciary's freedom tomorrow?"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM., said: "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media tribunal "will always remain biased, as it is part of the government" and said banning subject matter and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to send the MPs back by rejecting this bill," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media," while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been "shocked" and the bill has been described as "cruel."
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after being attacked by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate Shopping Mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of the troops sent to the scene of the attack, showing them purposefully robbing the mall, causing officials to become angry with the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had sent summons to two journalists and media personnel for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after the media squabbled.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings can be fined to media companies and there will be an additional risk of "deleting from the list" or not being recognized by the official press.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the violator if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "A single economy is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations."
It also said these measures could have the pernicious effect described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can do their own thing.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew Kenyai describes the media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "no one will ever know."
"If left to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and hoarding,"" he wrote."
In the past, Kenyan legislators have faced the wrath of the people.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and had restored about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free fixed wages, which the world is considered to be among the highest.
World's richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's wife's birthday is on November 1, but as soon as the night of October 30 clocks played twelve, the entire Jodhpur Nita Ambani's birthday started ringing.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was entirely made up of the performance of the team of AR Rahman.
At 8 p.m., Rehman presented his signature songs on this musical night.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage to sing the beautiful colours of the dance.
Nita Ambani arrived in Jodhpur with 32 charters for the guests attending her birthday party.
Due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars in which BMW and Jugar were in demand.
Sood said that the cleaning system in the city, street light has completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the Nagar Nigam and Huda to run the Panchkula city centre.
He has asked Panchkula to get rid of the house completely.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that after the municipal elections, the city has got a new councillor and mayor, but they do not have the power to work.
As a result, the city council has become a dummy and the officers are working on their own.
Sood said that the Municipal Corporation has got crores of rupees, but all the money is being collected by depositing the interest as FD in the banks.
However, no steps are being taken to promote the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of dumping grounds in Sector 23, people living in the ghastly cross sectors have been forced to live a hellish life for the past several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in the village of Juriwala for the last several years, but the people of the Barwala region are already getting two or four from the serious problem of flies.
He said that the health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated completely.
To date, no work has been started to provide facilities to people in rural areas.
The U.N. has set new targets for tackling poverty.
The United Nations is immediately starting work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the M.D., which ended in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role in advancing the “Transport Development Goals” just before the overnight Sanitary Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time has come to "rise above national interests."
I am very pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting up the universal transport development goal.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to meet our far-reaching objectives of the modal development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns are growing as powerful individuals clash with each other.
With a statue of Mozambique's founder President Samora, who was haunting them below, thousands gathered in central Maputo for the slogan of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearing about her country's future, she changed her corporate dress from printed T-shirt to "we demand security" in an interview and joined a crowd of capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Re Namo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after the peace agreement was signed.
Re Namo was once an infamous rebel of the movement backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have emboldened foreign investors and local people.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, with large offshore gas reserves in the west and exploration of coal reserves in Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, some of the companies could bring in more than $50bn of investment next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the main political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tension.
Re Namo says the government launched the latest conflict by attacking its members on October 17 in Sofa La province, a traditional Re Namo stronghold.
Attacks on former insurgents and escalating government forces attacked Renmo sites and told the Financial Times that Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, had tried to kill Fernando Majang, a spokesman for Re Namo.
The government blames Re Namo for the trigger, accusing him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gibbuzhan has called for an end to concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, Mr. Jeebushan told AFP, the French news agency that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "lost" form of "whatever remains to be tried to prove to his forces that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Re Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mahang was quoted as saying that Re Namo had cancelled the 1992 peace agreement but later became the subject of concern.
He told FT that the agreement is not being honoured by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back for the compromise talks, but seriously," said Mr. Mahangne.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to lessen the sheer tension of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about the two big men (Gibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer and Mozambique expert at the University of London Open.
Neither of them are good negotiators, nor do they need to be prepared to make concessions.
Re Namo, who is pushing for election reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a patient movement to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
Re Namo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, created by a former Re Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Majang says Mr. Jebuzhanko - who has left office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," said Mr. Mahang.
It is not clear what type of capability Ray Namo has, but he has made a disruptive hit-and-run tour of police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
The majority of the conflicts are in the province of Mihai La Sofa, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with the host brewing port that relies on mining, exporting coal, including Rio Tinto and the valley.
Rio suspended its use for about a week in June after the threat of an attack on the Ray Namo Line.
Re Namo was Mr. Mahangwini when asked if he would be able to repeat this threat or not.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," said Mr. Mazhang.
The government of instability has exacerbated the conflicts, says Fernando Lima, media cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about the recent flood of corruption, slow pace of development and kidnappings.
"The people of the country are the government and the president of the people responsible for the future, and they think they should be one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar Sultanat, an exhibitor, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends "as models for a way of life of the author."
Thor's stories could show "there is no match for all the subtle tricks in Kruger's strength," while Erzurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Even to teach many of the myths "unprecedentedly far away from the wild and even in some cases it would not be appropriate to teach it in porn and schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated a "precautionary choice" of age-appropriate actions.
"I think it's amazing, in America, myth and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I've been doing this as a plan for 20 years.
He has called writers and teachers "more educators" and it's "a new turn" for children, along with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales from Anglo Saxon along with writing the Penguin book, said: "You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps the writing of an adult writer for a child and the writing of an adult writer for an adult require some sense of hope.
Everything has to come to a simplified or a pleasant end, because it is an easy feeling of good and evil.
And said that should be submitted, rather than said revealed through a story.
The old base is not showing.
Spokesman, Ghumarvi: Head Constable Om Prakash retired after serving 32 years in the police department in Ghumarvi.

Om Prakash Panchayat is a resident of the village of Bani Bhapral.
He provided better services during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in the United States: nearly a hundred years ago, comedian Frank Fe, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to chat directly with people sitting in the crowd.
F's search has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute of Caroline Hirsch, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
Hirsch says, "Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became a huge success, to the point where they became too big to be played at the club."
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s program includes the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual Music and Comedy Benefit for Military Retirees at Madison Square Garden, “Stand Up for Heroes” featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Raw, and John Raw.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional media, such as shows coming on small networks like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Crowe, a deep-cable sitcom (F.X.'s flamboyantly ranchy fantasy-football-themed "The League"), reached the top spot, and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marsal The Shell With Shoes On."
Other young comedians with distinct voices, including Crawl and Slate (anthony jeselnick with a distinctly disillusioned voice, cumbersome, ethnicity-focused w. kamau bell) are products of the American comedy-focused world.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be, an interview: Talking to Larry David of David Steinberg:
Steinberg had begun working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a noted television and film director, as well as an unauthorized comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will be held in Manhattan's downtown, in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the D.N.A. comedy of all Larry's works,"" Steinberg said."
They were telling me that when they are here, sometimes they go down the street between the two buildings and think to themselves that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall towards $96 per barrel
A report showing concern over more supplies such as Friday's continued decline in oil prices is offset where China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents on the US crude New York Mercantile Exchange in electronic trading in Europe until late morning at $96.24 per barrel.
The contract has fallen 5.8 percent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has been on the rise in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
For more than five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand in the activity has revealed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come on Friday.
This shows that developments can continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after 7.8 per cent decline in the last quarter from a two-decade third quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's suspension and sports policy.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court required a judge's order for the New York Police Department's rest and sports program to block the changes and remove the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & Judge Shira Schindler has said that the judge will await the outcome of the rulings on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city ruled in August that it was a violation of the Constitution in the manner it excluded people from its programme of containment and interrogation.
The city's police department has also decided to allocate a monitoring to help with its policy and associated training program changes, its findings and its curative orders appealed.
The appellate court heard the arguments on the request travel on Tuesday.
The Appellate Court has held that since it must have agreed to a requirement for a Judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and the public to act differently from the Code of Conduct for US Judges should therefore be removed from the Judges case, the pleadings of the respondents should be rebutted.
The judge ruled that police officers had wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its rest and sports programme.
She has appointed an outside monitor to monitor major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training, and supervision, and she is the one who has ordered a pilot program to test body-wear cameras in some campuses.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the City is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The rest and sports device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The rest and sports policy has been around for decades in some ways, but most black and Hispanic men have recorded dramatic growth under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise an all-time high from 684330 in 2011.
A trial of four men was filed by all minorities in 2004 and became a matter of class action.
Proponents of the NYPD's pause and change in sports program have said that the end of unfair behavior will have to be a more reliable and effective police force mold and may affect the use of other police department policies.
Opponents say the changes will reduce the police's morale, but crime, waste of money and not pressure from thousands of officials over the past decade will solve a broader problem of a police force.
The judge has noted that there was no end to rest and play, which is constitutional, but improved implementation of the NYPD's stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were informed about various sciences including tent pitching, flag pole.
The duty of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants in the All-Religious Prayer are spreading the spirit of unity.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm classified information.
Former News of the World editor Andy Callson has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his alleged relationships while he was the home secretary of Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polly.
The court said the newspaper had appointed private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby's voicemail and "keep the man" in check, but Colson also called and dropped his voicemail.
"The suggestion of the prosecution is that Mr. Callson, who is currently the editor of the NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's houses and keep an eye on them, but rather to keep an eye on them and see what people react to them,"" Mr Addis said."
He said that the N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third was the editor himself.
He knew, of course, that he knew the other way around, and he knew the other way around.
What about the first one?
Did you know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
Rumors about Clark's premarital relationship were first introduced by the A.O.T.W.'s feature desk at the time, when a sexually permissive source in Ms Polby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
From Mulcare's home in August 2006, the tape of voicemail from Ms Polby's phone was seized at least three times.
Investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer, on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "Project".
During the period during which he was being examined, Ms Polby's grandfather was asked to provide information about him by making anonymous phone calls.
Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watched Ms. Polby's arrival and departure.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr Addis said Colson's involvement in the case is in the pattern of other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blanket about the affair with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to negotiate with others to hack into the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone hacking.
Promote corporate fear by exposing the NSA to state surveillance. . . .
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter blew up at the U.S. Embassy in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Office for the Defence of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US headquarters, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundysbank.
The German media asked the BfV to express hope for identifying the presence of the Leasing Antenna and signalled an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and increase or raise the line below their international competitiveness."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made Whistleblowers, began to tell American surveillance the treasure trove of his secrets, European governments and the leaders of the business world are no longer sure that the director is not going to keep his promise.
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) spied on Brazil's oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, certainly the leaders of the business world are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for this data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy of German companies, the US has almost now become a big risk, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all the documents, however, there is no evidence to date that the US has gone into the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the EU's lack of internet capabilities. And it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, said "This is no way."
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he would not have had to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is affordable. From coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden’s revelations about U.S. technical sophistication and spying access have proved to be a shock to some companies that previously believed China’s biggest surveillance threat is China.
A big change is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after disclosure about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says: “We saw a new question that didn’t come to customers a year ago – that’s – my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and should guard against them at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
It has always happened.
"It's been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussions, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The U.S. spies on us at the commercial and industrial level and so do we, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not willing about the defense system and it is a benefit to the attacker.
For large companies, it’s been a long time coming to record a message whether it’s unwise to leave a business at home with a USB stick, or a laptop without leaving a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car manufacturer Audi, says that this is a one-year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when considering that smart phones are compromising on risk on overseas tours.
The pre-paid mobile phone was later dropped.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it is at the top of many companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The U.S. has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
In February, according to the France The Washington Post, the name of US national intelligence was named in a second tier of hackers involved in hacking, the economic intelligence behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "French is the worst
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: "The services know well that all countries, even if they join in the non-terrorist fight, spy on their allies."
The U.S. spies on us at the commercial and industrial level and so do we, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one has made a fool of themselves.
Parents of Georgia teenager killed in 'unique accident' believe his son was murdered
A Georgia teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a restyling mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Waldosta, G.A. K. K. Johnson was found trapped in a mat directly behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a 'unique accident', but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Attorney Benjamin Krump, who introduced Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "she fully believes that her son has been murdered."
He doesn't believe in death in the way the sheriff told him.
"He believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and common sense,"" Krump said."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag."
U.S. Attorney General Michael Rawlare said Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, given that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever we go.
My goal is to bring out the truth.
“I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told the reporter that initial body tests showed signs that Johnson's death was due to "situational respiratory arrest."
According to Moore, a different cause of death was found in a second body test."
"There are so many questions that need to be answered or confirmed,"" he said."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal in Johnson's death case or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the London County Sheriff's Office.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered the magistrates to release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some indication of how he died.
C.D.C. issues guidelines on allergy of children for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children's food allergies at the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children going to school suffers from food allergies.
One out of every 20 children in the U.S. now has a food allergy.
The CDC found that there has been an 18 percent increase in food allergy cases among children between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline provides information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and in case of an allergic reaction, how to handle them.
Schools have also been suggested to keep a stock of epinephrine to cope with potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis - which is the auto-injector of the Appen brand most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep stocks of more apenephrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms communicated by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It looks like something is sticking in my tongue," "It looks like there's hair on my tongue," or "My tongue is getting tingly."
Parents of intersex kids can choose their children's 'gender undetermined'
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise the third gender for children born with unclear genitalia.
Newborns will no longer be assigned male or female in an orderly manner.
Under the new law, parents are not required to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex ‘undetermined’ or ‘unspecified’ on the child’s birth certificate.
The aim of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can expedite gender-specific decision-making for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the B.B.C., an intersex man had said years later, "Neither I am a man nor a woman."
I will keep the wounds, the scars, the bandages made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one child out of every 2,000 children a year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the scrutiny of sexual development disorders, this is the collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitalia (ovarian or vulva), or abnormally developed sexes.
Well, maybe it's the Simpsons.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify gender when there can be no gender-defining and to seek medical treatment, if such a development occurs, before the child is mentally ill and mentally ill.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender-identification cases, said Germany's new law "seems like a good thing."
Intersex children create moral discord.
"Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then look at how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
In a report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described as either transsexual or transgender, as their status is not related to gender but is related to their biological makeup, which is neither explicitly male nor female.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual manifestations, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual manifestations such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in the genitourinary structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and partisan crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal made to have "unspecified" sex status until life-long.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have the third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighbouring countries in France are still contentious.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw the “gender theory” from the school’s books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany’s law, saying, “While the world is going into a state where sex is a self-chosen option, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn baby in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see the babies be assigned gender at the time of birth.
He said on the website about parenting, "Boarding is very stressful without any additional limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex as a slate that could be erased and then written down.
But now many people are challenging the morality of surgery, they are understanding that sex-recognition is complex work, and sometimes doctors can also make mistakes, who don’t know what children will feel about their sex specification as they grow up.
Dresher says "in the mid-20th century, it was called the "manor disease emergency."
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon-physician.
The current theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered the sex to be constructible.
He coined the word "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - determine by interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had gone to the accident-prone sex during the sex-restriction (circumcision) process to remove the child's ovary by fully binding it and treat it as if it were a lactation-bearing girl.
"Mani presented that case as a successful case of substitution, but it didn't happen,"" Dresher said."
At the age of 15, the child turned back to himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s, individuals going through these gender stereotypes began to come up with "not happy with the outcome."
The same case was with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with the X-Y male chromosome, but his gender was unclear.
Doctors clearly didn't understand that her sex was small, or her boss was big, but they were sure she could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and ovary were removed by surgery and her upbringing became like a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn’t happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, she was going to have vaginoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and a little confused, he demanded medical records, he said.
This led him to the terrible truth.
I was tied up at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man back, took a dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to medical reasons, he became pregnant.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to normalize their perceptions.
But Annie Tamer-Mattis, the executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Information Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chippy and shame."
“A lot of activist people think that Germany’s law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and to specify the child as ‘undetermined’,” she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We think that rather than waiting, it is better to specify male or female gender.
But we don’t know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,"" he said."
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "give strength to both parents and children."
Baratji's daughter Cathy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a complete androgen insensitivity disorder called DSD.
Since her androgen receptor was defective, female perspiration developed in Cathy.
Her body has a vagina but no uterine or uterine glands.
The 29-year-old is now married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is pregnant, but she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law makes it easier for parents not to make decisions on their own in a hurry,"" Baratz said."
It provides them with a proper understanding and time by some test before they write ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and have fun with it.
We do not need to do such surgery in a hurry that can not be returned.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees them from the doubt that motivates parents because they don't believe they are doing well."
Eventually, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with -- and that will be a very good thing.
This allows children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was held at the Middle School Dalher in Ramnagar under the chairmanship of Tahsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar and Sub Judge Sandeep Kaur of Ramnagar.
In which students and others were informed about the law for the right to education and economically backward people.
In the camp, advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch made the people aware while speaking on the said subject.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's close advisers quietly considered Hillary Clinton's ticket for 2012 in place of Biden's.
The most notable blast at the unveiling is the hugely anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012" by Mark Halperin and John Heleman.
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and told Thursday evening that the President's top advisers could help Obama in his declining hopes of re-election to know what dumping Biden could do to get hold of "large-group sessions and polling in late 2011."
According to the Times National Political Reporter Jonathan Martin, the book details the full details of the main officers' campaign efforts and the White House, named after former White House staff chief Bill. To find out what effect former State Secretary Clinton's change from Vice President Paul
The possible switch was a very safe secret inside the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including former Obama campaign chief Jim Macina, and former White House senior advisers David Axlrod and David Paluffe – were aware of the changes under consideration.
The "double down" claims Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal concurrence before finally making a decision when his information indicated that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's condition.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's replacement with Biden.
"I looked at the whole scene and said, 'And one of them, that's it,'" Dale told the newspaper.
Do you remember, that at that time the presidency was in jeopardy so we were in such a state of, "Holy Christ, what else shall we do?"
While Dale described the research as "precautionary," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made significant investments in finding out how much the claim would pay off when the poll was held.
"The campaign doesn't spend money like voting and focusing on focused groups until they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked the cast if their boss knew about the potential change?
While Dale said he "didn't think the president knew about the potential change," the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that it was known to Obama.
"Double down" sure: Will not answer whether the political inquiry reached Obama's desk? Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about Biden's dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
Glo-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
She came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical luminosity to re-illuminate the protein.
Ice cream, which will increase the pH level of the protein by reacting with the tongue, will brighten the ice cream.
Chris says that the ice cream glows with the heat of the mouth reacting, that is, the more the win will be felt, the more it will glow.
Charlie, founder of Lik Mi M Delisius Ice Cream Company, said: “This is an incredible thing but the production of early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been experimenting for the last few months and it feels just right to share it on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glow effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I’ve made because Jellyfish’s luster is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
The ice cream, however, is very good.
Apne is famous for its unusual flavor, including the experimental company based in Bristol, beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next composition is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It’s a natural impossibility because of the ice crystals that make the ice cream bounce on top of it, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the reproducible properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was crowded with customers in the Queen Bagh market.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy the pot.
The same was recently seen in the central markets of Wazirpur, Awantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar.
Some of the same sightings were also seen at the surf shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
The people also bought gold, silver, and silver coins in great abundance.
Due to this, other markets, including the outer ring road, were also jammed.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in jail to get home.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more of a fan.
I didn't even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won't this year either.
But the statistics show that I am a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating $158 million Halloween this time around., $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and clothing and decorations.
One of the things that I've always wanted to see is the holodeck.
According to the NRF, the total cost of the dress is estimated at $6.2 billion.
This year, all of us are angry with the sexist inanimate objects.
Women don't have to wear makeup; because she's also the sexy food of Jesse's pizza, hamburgers, and carrots.
Hoping for a lot of zombies for men, and thanks to the evil space men of the dead will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after dresses will be zombies, batsmen, looters and thieves.
I guess there is no harm in being traditional.
Last year we dressed up as dogs and we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million on pet clothing.
That's why there are a lot of dog breeds out there.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hayarshi Bars, Lollipops, Milk Ducks, Twislers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is good news that 41 million trucks and trucks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and those who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, we will not use a thing during Halloween, but it will also sell about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion of Mecca's personal wealth.
It's a mystery. To solve yet
There's nothing more to it than a Halloween Halloween party.
They have the best name, "The Terror Behind the Wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Scream-O-Scream" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the U.S. government, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million rupees. And those awesome good pictures that your friend posts on Facebook and the man who likes and doesn’t comment on you.
In the end, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, there were "baby in a pump trend" thanks to pinterest that started just last year, so most of us grew up mapping these guards and not having to hang out with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack-o-slowly squeezing laurel on the porch in front of him probably from Illinois, which this year exceeded 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you're looking for extra credit, try to inscribe the phone Tim and Susan Masts in Napa, Caliph., and above their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin.
It was decided to issue a postage stamp with a photo of Sachin during the pre-match presentation, the MCA said in a statement.

The dream of traders to do business in the Patakha market located in the transport area was not realized.
Patakah traders have been trapped in Mazdar after the order of the High Court.
Neither they can now trade in the temporary firecracker market built at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued a license to trade in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
Amritsar's deputy commissioner was also fined Rs 10 lakh for not being properly managed.
In its order, the High Court has infuriated the Amritsar administrative authorities by saying what kind of administration could not solve even one of the difficulties of the shopkeepers for nine years.
They could not be given a proper place in the city.
After this, proper security management and firearms traders were asked to issue a license for the business in the market located at the shipyard.
Even after the order, the shopkeepers were happy, but the police turned the water over to them on Friday.
The team of the real licence branch of the police arrived at the Patakha market and sold the form by setting up a counter there.
After that, it was impossible to fulfill the conditions that were told to them in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma Patakah, Incharge of Asalha Licensing Branch, arrived at the market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firemen.
Therefore, the license was not issued to the shopkeepers.
Diwali has one day left.
As a result, the traders are upset.
He is facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Patakha traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will sue the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry Pataka traders on Friday night took the Rash March from Jahangarh to Ranjit Avenue.
Protesters raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
Subsequently, the business in the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost pup at the mouth of a mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after coming into a small road collision
Three days later, he was spotted by a dog walker trapped in a mine.
Firefighters took down the front of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After being somehow trapped 50 feet above the ground by the Pope at the mouth of a distressing mountain, he got a lucky life from being called firemen.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby, who fled Sunday afternoon after coming into a road collision, spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were in the Flappy Mine in Yorkshire to meet them again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After his escape from a minor accident, he had searched like crazy for his lost dog, and an appeal had been posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 pm, a sharp-eyed doc walker spotted Ruby, 50 feet above the ground, on a mountain in the mine.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheaton Fire Station reached the spot and landed down by rope to save Ruby and used a stomach tube to bring her down from the rock.
Expert technical defence officer Andy Clayton said: “He was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet up and down.
He did not take a single action during the rescue, he remained a stone.
But now he is good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual call for help.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Special technical defence officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived in a fortunate way."
He was likely to be seriously injured or even in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to an animal doctor for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to get it back in your hands.
The animal doctor said that if she gets too tired and falls, she will definitely fall down.
The fire department did a great job.
What he did was a very brave thing.
We were very happy with them and they were all great.
Mr. Alderson also told Keagli: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn't hit him when she was 18
In an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had sung backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dined with the senior rocker, and 'he hit me when I was 18'.
He said, "This is getting old, and he treats me well."
A representative for the 70-year-old Jagger said in a statement Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting the Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perhaps Perry is talking about him in the misunderstanding of another person."
Perry was one of the singers to arrive as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prize" reached the top spot this week.
George Keravan: The break-up of Europe has given Scotland a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
At Barwick, passport control and the barbed wire border on Hadrian's walls hint at stories.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of independent movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that the EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as required.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, Brussels will be an affordable discount for Brussels in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, again, a no-brainer.
And the thing that has stuck for such a long time is that it’s stuck. At first I heard “freedom means passport control” unfounded news about 40 years ago.
Still, this interesting old story lost an interesting point in retelling.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should the Yoke of London be bought and sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
The parties dedicated to opposing the EU or shutting down the euro as a single currency across the EU are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly got about fifty million votes in the federal election of September, and thus the free Democrats (compared to our own Lib Dems) out of effect.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a Union Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a transformative one.
Along with the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that the project has gone too far because of the obstacles imposed on national economies by complying with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not play a very large role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system has stabilized its members' exchange rates in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency depreciation, southern Europe finds itself in a situation of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity gap far beyond the current budget and currency problems.
To provide exemptions to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a staggering cost loss, which we have already seen at the Grangemouth.
Even being frozen all the wages in the world, the European petrochemical industry cannot escape being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, a sense of rebellion has been stirring in the people, especially in France, which was once the leading fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany, and Paris as a means of providing equal billing to Wanzigton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing France’s economy to crumble.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the EU's anti-National Front, has won by pushing the ruling socialist to third place in the recent by-election.
At the moment, the Front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it is a timely warning to the British Labour that they cannot go on believing that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with his newfound fame among the French blondes, working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, anti-currency group in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, the EU's opposition parties perform well in these elections, then such a group could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon a coalition of anti-EU and anti-mind sentiment in Europe will wipe out the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will come back in some form like a “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that will be backed by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its conservative economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its proximity to the U.S.
However, Wanchigton's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What's next for Scotland?
We can choose to remain (necessarily) the territory of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do a better job in a loose European order, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-union nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic freedom by following Norway’s path.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - was the most successful anti-spam political campaign in Europe in 2011, which was opposed to the austerity measures proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling. The austerity measures proposed by Labour's Aadhaar (then implemented) and subsequently the Tory-led coup d'état.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as in that situation it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Years: Growing up early
The research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls are getting younger at a younger age than their older, white girls.
Physical change doesn't mean that youth is close.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed.
Experts believe that infertility outbreaks can be a cause of youth at a younger age
The case of youth ahead of time is not as effective in boys
Pat Ethric, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist on children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter begins to develop breasts at the age of 7 or 8 years and have pubic hair?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz made it clear that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, these new trends are the norm.
Caplovitz says, “I spend a lot of time trusting parents — that it doesn’t usually indicate rapid progress toward full-blown youth.”
Direct signs of development such as tingling of the breasts, genitals and hair of the eye and physical smell appear prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of the Rajodarshan (first monthly-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years in the first rhododarson," explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of "The Time-Early Youth in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is time.
There is debate about what is the onset of adolescence, but when breast growth occurs before the age of 8 years, two call it "child-adult."
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by a hair doctor.
In case of more rapid progress, it may be necessary to be examined by an endocrinologist to eliminate the chances of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay pre-menstrual and other consequences: premature age-increase of bones, which can lead to immature growth and sluggishness as an adult.
The formulas for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are aware of the drugs but admit, "Pressure to young people can increase behavioral issues, and girls can start to feel different from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: the parents simply do not want their younger daughter to have a monthly religion.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," Caplovitz said.
A woman whose daughter started monthly religion at the age of 10 remembers, "It was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about the monthly religion, but it was not emotionally ready.
He was afraid of his school and came back upset that he had first started a monthly religion in his peers.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media can be blamed.
Boys too - just like girls - are getting pre-teens.
Caplovites lay down the rule that the main cause of this is the inflammation of the sluggishness.
He had assisted in conducting studies on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001, linking body fat to adolescence.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it as well.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get younger before they reach their age.
There are many explanations for this.
On a global scale, the image of pre-teens, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seem to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of completely youthfulness is not as clear as girls in them.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see the hair of the muzzle and genitals.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goreeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginnings of youth."
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children about this.
Caplovitz advised, "It may mean negotiating ahead of schedule."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Prematurely developing girls need to be reassured that even if it’s happening ahead of time but it’s part of normal life.
The temperature had dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
The rain and the cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Friday, people wore sweaters and went to the markets and their destination.
After the first rain of the winter, people have also taken off the rye.
In the morning, people also enjoyed the sun.
The weather will also get a lot of relief from the disease, etc., but after that, the sun continued to shine due to cloud cover throughout the day.
The children also wore sweaters and went to school.
According to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature on Thursday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.

Big orders of jet manufacturers from dispute to seat width at stake.
This month's Dubai Airshow has seen a stir setting up a row for the fight for long-haul flights among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats
The controversy in long-haul aircraft focuses on the width of the economy class seat, not always as given by airlines but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed to be the key by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus is expected to give at least an 18-inch (46 cm) wide seat in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by the airline's main rival Boeing.
The controversy comes as the makers of the aircraft began selling the larger version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft from the potentially recorded order after the incident of 17-21.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10, taking into account the claims of greater capacity, are the designs of mini jumbo jets being prepared?
Boeing says it has created the "777 X" that will place 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in the uniform department.
Airbus says the A350 will take 350 people to an 18-inch nine-equal seat.
Aircraft giants often strike business on technical matters through advertisements in the trade press.
Now, the Airbus 777X is expected to dominate more than 100 orders at the Dubai Airshow, further appealing to the public.
Recently it is being seen that the beginning of the Vigilance War has been anything but showing Finnsero this together in a restaurant three at a time will you accept it?
Airbus sales chief John Leahy said "the Boeing regional turbo is also offering long-haul flights in the vicinity."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the plane sits hasn't changed.
According to U.S. Department of Health data, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Jumbo Ne modern long-distance ki yatra ko tha, and the ant me of the century, the average 40-49-year-old American male ke weight me increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American male waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is stuck with a 1950s seat concept when the average circumference of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent improvement in the quality of sleep across the width of the seat.
Boeing has disputed Airbus' seat measurement figures, saying it does not depend on manufacturers' decision on how airlines balance rents and amenities.
It also says, research shows that more than the width of a seat depends on cabin experience.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and telling them what they believe they need to do to be successful,"" said Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver."
"They don't want to tell us what they're profiting from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the elbow room for the flyers, but for the suppliers it's a matter of speed that it can affect the income.
At least $700 billion worth of trade behind the dispute is estimated to be enough in the coming decades to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.
For the first time in July, the seat layout is actually a battle issue between the new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that there has been 20 per cent efficiency per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 in their new twin engine design.
The performance of the Boeing depends on the comparison with the design of the 777 with the 10's 777 X forest original 9.
10 equals the unit cost with profit is now used.
Kevin Caniston, the head of Europe’s Airbus passenger facility, said: “Boeing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive, with our products, to occupy more seats.”
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin suggests for the current 777S that many passengers are in favor of the Denver layout, which can go along with cheap fares.
"The 18-inch seat width will be very good for passengers, but the reality is that this Airbus business point is driven by the threat of the 777," said My Carby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for the airlines.
Jet sellers around the world should also carefully take measures to check on this layouts competition.
While relaxing more, all builders are also providing high-density layouts for low-cost jet aircraft services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving it a 10 equal to the A350 but says it hasn't sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on wide-ranging cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft for the need for more cabin facilities.
Modern jet aircraft are not likely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it may deviate from the 777 X sales wave.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May Eliminate the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun that comes from smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine, mice were able to protect themselves from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is required before testing on humans, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal, of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York, said the underlying signs are positive.
"We very much hope that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions more smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market today," said Professor Cornell, "but they found that nicotine is more powerful than nicotine."
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which has been designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies to it.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent them from building up inside the smoker's socket by exerting an effect before reaching the brain.
In the trial, vaccinated mice that were later given nicotine continued to do their normal activities.
The researchers say that but the rat that wasn’t given the vaccine did “feel good,” which was a sign that nicotine had reached her brain.
This experiment was described in a journal called Science Transnational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies in them.
It had to be given at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children, before the desire to try cigarettes, to protect them from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the postmortem, the tiger could not be covered up due to the actual cause of death.
The forest department has responded to this by saying that the death of the tiger is natural at first sight.
On Thursday night, the forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Pavalgarh Conservancy Reserve Khichdi drain.
While all the body parts of the tiger were safe, there were no marks of injury or injury etc.
On Friday, in the presence of Forest Conservation Officer Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kakkasha Nasim, SDO GS Karki, CTR Veterinarian Bharat and Kotabag Veterinarian Hema Rathore, Baghin Ke
According to sources, the tiger's internal body is said to have deteriorated during post-mortem.
This did not reveal the cause of the tiger's actual death.
Departmental officials continued to respond to Golmaal's death.
However, IVRI Bareilly has been sent to the internal organs of the tiger for a topsychological examination to confirm the poison.
West circle forest conservationist Vivek Pandey said the tiger's death can only be said to be natural.
The body of the tiger has not been found to have any symptoms of poison etc.
However, a probe has been sent to confirm the poison, along with a search of the surrounding area.
Tripods deny that we are being influenced by Obid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Zoa Tripodi will be scrutinized by the State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Zoa Tripodi has denied that the policy was denied at the request of her political guru, A.D. Obid, the protector of former New South Wales, whose self-sacrifice was hidden in the government-controlled three lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed its investigation into whether Mr. Obid violated the circulars of the Parvi Patna policy from several state ministers. Where two restaurants owned by Obid and cafes, without the renewal of their tenders, were closed for the time being.
Lin Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, after the evidence given on Thursday, knew the secret self-interest of Mr. Tripodi, Mr. Obid, that the allegation is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pushed for the launch of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and they wanted more time.
Enterprises of the circular for leases in 2009, with Obid earning $2.5 million a year, were renewed with no lease tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargah from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obid, Mr. Tripodi had urged a change in the government lease policy
Copy presented in a phone call at ICAC in August and September 2007 Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had come to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obid after working at the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," replied Mr. Tripody.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obi-Wan.
Officials say Israeli warplanes launched a raid in Syria.
Israeli warplanes targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not specify what the purpose was, but there was at least one purpose needed.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass the "certificate" test
The government is considering a "certificate" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to extend a tough procedure.
If adopted, this test would be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457 being used to fill in incompetent posts in Australia or to be conveyed to family and friends in an elaborate manner.
A government discussion letter was released today, denouncing the government's terminator about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McQue said today that it could anger Australia's neighbouring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and "strong rhetoric to the Australian people about a job first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labour market."
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided with protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some in the region had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the people who smuggled in, has implemented five proposed changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "certificate" criterion is adopted, the examination of the visa applicant can be made as to whether "the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa, or the relevant person is a relative or personal partner."
Businessmen may need to keep track of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor fewer employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's troubled nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, an adult cousin of his, who was on the same boat, has tied the knot.
Australian officials took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died on the spot.
The British government has announced a study to boost Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cremer said that the project will "bring Britain together."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "very excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider ways to further improve rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Barones Cremer: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of Britain’s 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will also be well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail is likely to have huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government, so that we can explore options for bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all and delivering the Glasgow-Edinburgh Line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the ministers of the British government next year and taking decisions together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will be effective in Australia right now.
Despite the steps taken in the equipment regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones when flying and when landing aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left open options for U.S. aviation service companies to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during the critical stages of flight, provided that they remain in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can do this on many flights right now, but many people don’t like to be unable to access their e-book when flying and landing planes, etc.
Australian aviation services companies are considering this decision, according to which U.S. aviation services companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia are still effective.
"Currently close to CASA, there is no specific regulation regulating the fumigation of electrical equipment in the aircraft by the members," the authority said, adding, "The issue falls under the regulations, according to which the aircraft service operating companies have to ensure that the safety system is always fully maintained, and the drivers of the vehicles."
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulator’s instructions.
"We would welcome a review by CASA in case the use of electrical equipment is allowed, as we really feel it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft," the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it will now comply with the current rules.
"Our current policy is that no electrical equipment can be used during the flight and landing of the aircraft, and we have no immediate plan to change that," it said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision, each U.S. airline will be different and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio transmission from mobile devices, as well as have to amend their rule books, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and provide passengers with brief details.
The FAA said that "after verification by airlines of the tolerability of their aircraft, it will allow passengers to use lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones that hold hands at all altitudes."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the aircraft.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper compartments during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Ponbrokers silver due to perceived difficulty by middle class in Singapore
In Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is taking money from her daughter's school fees by giving her gold earrings, rings and earrings to pay for her daughter's school fees at the Bendamier Shopping Centre in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it."
She says that although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also does the job, the monthly income of the family remains insufficient.
In fact, parts of Southeast Asia have similar demand - where domestic debt is rising - the valuemax where they are making their transactions, this week became the third pan-shop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Jewelry hoarding is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga's $1,300 Singapore dollar - but almost as cheap as an almost unsecured bank loan.
Ponbroker generally takes interest of 17 per cent per annum in Singapore, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of pay, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to Ponshop due to the increasing cost of living by families and the difficulty due to the increase in domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth following the global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slump in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard's Angel Puers, described rising domestic profits due to rising mortgages as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Asia has the highest domestic debt to GDP ratio in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged from this week's technology slump.
On Thursday, data showed a steady decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"The crucial point is that with rising prices, people coming from the middle [of the economy] to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way,"" said Song Sung-Wun, economist at the Central Bank of Malaysia."
Historically high values in gold values over the past two years have motivated people to keep personal properties mortgaged, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family’s jewelry.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items seized in the 200-pon outlet of the City-State are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's put the gold chain of grandma's, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest pan-shop operator, Ejimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the business of keeping garvi that the directors of the outlet in Bendimir, Valuemax, and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand to Malaysia, not only in their neighbourhood, where it has four stores, but also plans to expand outside Asia.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (lenders) have been criticized due to the high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that having a mortgage not only gets a cheaper rate compared to other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
"Consumers hold onto items they already have, and paying off personal assets does not increase household debt," he says.
The social acceptance of Ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and secure financial assistance.
It's not that Ponbrokers are only used by financially weak people.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use the valuemax outlet, they hold gold bars or Rolex watches that can get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have clients from all walks of life.
“These include wealthy individuals who need a loan for a short time for a business venture or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow needs,” says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a short amount of time.
India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani and wife Nita Ambani are celebrating their 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organised a very big party on the occasion.
Several big stars of Bollywood reached Jodhpur to attend the party. On the late evening of October 31, several big stars were seen catching a flight from Jodhpur to Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karisma Kapoor, Gita Basra, Vinod Khanna and her wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, etc.
Obviously, you can guess how big the flames will be when such a big name joins the party.
$325 million for the health of Taggis
The Union government has stressed that there are also strict conditions attached to the $325 million rescue package for the sickening health system of Tasmania which will ensure that the state government cannot squander the fund.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pillarsec has announced that the Commonwealth, the island state is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis due to the age of the population, high rates of chronic diseases, and the limitations of the system.
The decision on the funding to be made over four years was made after consultation of the government with independent MP Andrew Wilkie of Tasmania.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we are confident will address the particular challenges that the state is facing," said Ms. Pillarsec.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help to resolve the previous collected cases.
It also includes funding for the launch of a walk-in clinic at Hobart and Lawnstation, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and personal electronic health records system at local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Pillarsec.
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state has to maintain the current level of funding to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member Commission will be constituted to ensure that service is provided in the most effective and efficient manner possible by the State.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean much, "unless real improvements are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more transportable level."
Yet, he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will prove very helpful in separating the state-run public health system from the crisis-affected list,"" Mr Wilkie said."
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly reverse the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-ed solution."
"We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million into its health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't consider taking about half a billion dollars from the state government and giving $300 million to the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Pillarsec should guarantee that not a single dollar of extra bureaucracy would be spent on the rescue package.
Denis DeRott's novel is a description of the best production design and time period in the conversion by Gillum Nichollux, but it has become far more than it should have been.
The novel, which depicts the time of France in the year 1760, tells the sad story of a young man named Susan, who is sent to the convent by her family members.
When she revolts, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the willful persecutor Mother Superior, and becomes the object of sexual attraction to the other.
This film never goes into sensuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narrative, it also risks becoming a boring film for the audience.
CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose an entrance fee in the garden due to the spread of dirt in the garden.

The officers concerned will be sent to their final Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed the ability to make its own chemical weapons.
The monitoring group on Thursday said Syria has destroyed critical equipment to make chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while a fierce conflict has erupted in northern Syria, which is very close to where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
At the same time, the Syrian movement group has said that almost 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the last date of November 1.
The Hague-based organization had designated Damascus to either destroy or "make ineffective" the machinery used to mix chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to fill them with war material.
Mainly to complete the initial phase of destruction, this ambitious development is a significant milestone aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of the year 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumsks still have to destroy the existing weapons and collection.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
Britain's Situation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement came at a time when the conflict in the city of Safira escalated on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage center.
The group, which details the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 61,067 are common citizens, including 6,365 children, she said.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar al-Assad is a member of the military, 18,678 are fighters in favour of the government and 187 Lebanese are Hizbullah insurgents.
It also said the dead included 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the conflict that has been going on since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Asad's military team continued to fight rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people on both sides were injured, but clearly nothing was said.
This war represents the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in a very short period of time, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
A statement to the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, said its team "is now satisfied and has confirmed - and all of Syria's declared significant production and mixing/floating equipment - has been seen as destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said they had completed the first phase of the verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, the two centers "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons products placed there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centres where the OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"""I salute the determination and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission so far undertaken by this organization,"" said Ahmed Ujumku, director general of the group, which is overseeing the OPCW."
The three-year-long civil war is mainly between the Assad government and its security forces, including Shia Islam, members of the Apartheid sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another incident, the head of the Observatory Rami Abdurrahman said that a massive explosion occurred on Wednesday at the Air Defense Centre in the coastal region of Syria in Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is yet to be ascertained, he said.
The police have recovered photocopies of fake registers, fake seals, laptops and fake registers from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the arrested accused included Rajiv Agarwal alias Binttu from Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal from Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gagai from Kohada and Sonu from Ghumar Mandi from Ghumar Nagar in Habowal.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with clerk and recorder Balbir Singh, of the Registrar's Office, took out the paper from the records of the vacant and old lands and then bought new stamp papers and prepared forged registers on them.
This was not the case after the real registry was lost and the fake registry was put on record.
The accused then sold the land in crores of rupees on forged paper.
At the same time, they were taking loans on these fake papers.
Thereafter, the real owner of the land was kept in check by the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the forgery register had special control over the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake register of those lands.
Police commissioner Gill said that the accused in the interrogation told that they have prepared fake registers of close to 150 so far.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft have been registered against Sargana Rajiv of the gang.
Infuriated at the sentence of the bomb plotter in Bali
Relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bomb blast, indignant at the sentence given to the bomber, said Umar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who has been running as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
If given the password, it can be released in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, with 202 people killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bomb blasts carried out at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in the year 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded the sentence of life imprisonment, though they could also demand that this person, known as the infamous “destructive person” as the master person making the bomb, be put to death.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of June Cortin, a woman living in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Restraint of his aspirations, he said that Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other cowardly terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told A.A.P., "He should be brought before the firing squad."
I have to live every day without my grandparents and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the club's nomination was cancelled following the explosion of a bomb loaded in a van parked outside the entire club.
Peter Hughes, a suicide bomber, was in the paddock bar just 20 seconds before the bag containing explosive material was detonated.
He went into a month-long coma as a result of the incident and died three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jammah Islamiyah terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Marah - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive, see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, a 20-year sentence is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of one of the Bali bomb blasts.
He escaped capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abtabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "She did not surrender."
Even to this day, the pain of causing so many people mental pain is not really there.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.A.: Air passengers can now use the gadget in the aircraft (but can't make cell phone calls)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to listen to music, read, work, play games, watch movies, read from the gate from entering to the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - as issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, F.A.A. Administrator Michael Hurta said the speed at which these changes are implemented will be different in each airline.
Airlines will have to show the F.A.A. how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for training manuals and collection of devices for their crew members to show the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted their plans.
"Based on the status of the plan, we can very quickly approve the extended use of the electronic device," the FAA said in a statement.
At present, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the aircraft door is closed.
They are expected not to turn them on until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again at the time of landing of the aircraft, and not turn it on until the aircraft is fully landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic disruption may allow their passengers to board the aircraft, while disembarking the aircraft and using the device at the time of taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is implemented in a secure manner - and we will work together with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we've been bored feeling like "Hall Monitors."
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in Airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, like the game online Scrabble, the famous incident associated with which is when in the year 2011 actor Alec Baldwin, was playing on his smartphone while staying at the aircraft park at the gate, and when he refused to turn off the device by American Airlines.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be collected as they will cause concern about injury to another person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority related to the phone call is with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the F.A.A.
The F.A.A. may remove restrictions on some electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a serious issue, not only because they can potentially cause disruption in navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruption in cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rojenkar said.
To investigate the issue, the Industry World Advisory Committee, formed by the F.A.A., last month submitted that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The pressure on the F.A.A. to reduce restrictions on their use has been increasing in recent years.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo have said there is no valid security reason for the ban.
Enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that about a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their device.
The F.A.A. began prohibiting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996, when a report of disruption in navigation and communication devices was received by passengers due to the carrying of FM radios and high-tech gadgets of that time.
The new airlines companies are more dependent on the electric system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved to be resistant to electronic interference by the F.A.A.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
The modified aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Huarta said most airlines companies should comply with the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit far less power transmission than the electronic devices of the previous generation.
For example, e-readers are the transmission of exactly the noun when turning the page.
But the transmissions are strong when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of the advocates of reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airlines and flew them to test the problems, but no such problem was found.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Passengers Union said he believes the disruption from the device is real, regardless of the risks involved.
Other members of the committee said, there are reports only described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee suggested that the F.A.A. pilot should be allowed to order the passengers to turn off the device at the time of landing of the aircraft in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
We are pleased that the F.A.A. has recognized that the traveler with pleasure is not incompatible with the traveler, the rescue and security, said C.E.O. Roger Doe of the U.S. Travel Association.
Learning from the successive bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police have tightened the waist for quick reaction during Diwali celebrations and emergency situations in view of security.
The traffic system will be smoothly run, prevention of incidents of speeding, teaching lessons to the traffickers, etc. A total of 1,800 soldiers will patrol all the main places of the city, including traffic jams at crowded markets and other places.
These jawans will include women police personnel, including PCR, traffic units.
Police personnel and commandos will also conduct a duty-to-record investigation at the city's hotels, guest houses and other places, including PG.
The police has directed the SHO to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
The DSP, including the inspector, has been tasked with conducting investigations at markets, malls and other places, including the city's VIP sectors.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the high authorities have also imposed the duty of additional police personnel in police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police had asked the fire department and the PGI Director, Principal Director and DHS, including Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH management, to keep a high alert from the staff of other dispensaries in the time of emergency.
To teach the lesson to the manchals, departmental officials have now imposed duty on women police personnel, including others, under the name of 'anti-gunda staff' led by the NGO.
The anti-gunda staff will arrest the men in plain clothes in crowded places, including markets, and in crowded areas.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to put 44 noses in the inner areas of the city.
At the same time, police personnel will remain at 38 naka points along the city's borders.
The bird was released back into the forest by air transport to protect it from North Sea rig
The bird, found floating on the North Sea oil rig, has been released back into the forest by air transport from the coast.
The bird, named Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before it was recovered by the Scottish SPCA at their Alloa rescue centre.
"This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of northern Europe, which came under the grip of strong winds over the North Sea," said Colin Sedon, the manager of the Centre.
It seems that the bird was tired and he took refuge on the oil rig.
He further said: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the water rail was healthy and well-maintained.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and a commitment was made to bring business together and to determine what changes the UK’s employment and prosperity maker wants to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we asked them what they think about the UK business with the EU, conducting the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders.
U-Gove considered 1000 business leaders, representing the UK's business size, areas and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming inactive.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, not to be involved in the long-term and vicious process of reform of the EU's secret institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these crucial qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far higher than the benefits of becoming part of the European commercial sector - even the vast businessmen who were traditionally in favour of European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants the UK, the EU, to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are driving towards a "significant change" that would give the U.K. back its lost power.
Its price is very high - the issue of treaty change for the UK and getting a better deal changed the vote in the poll, 16 per cent in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: This survey shows that UK businessmen, in the EU, support their plan to negotiate the terms of Britain's membership.
It also showed that the businessmen expect the current balance of power to be renegotiated by making a meaningful change in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and very quickly it is becoming mandatory, as the Eurozone, the allied economy and the fiscal union are moving forward.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businessmen this means a new focus on business and a fundamental shift in Brussels’ regulatory procedure.
Alexi Miller of Gazprom called the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new era
The head of Gazprom said that the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
“A historic event has taken place today: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe,” said Alexey Miller, president of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide a variety of Russian export routes to Europe.
Officials said that Ukraine, where the majority of Russia's gas is for Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes in a dispute related to the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries "forever" associated with it.
After the start of operation of this entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at rates exempt from South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

The Royal Commission has heard allegations of sexual offences against two YMCA employees before the charges against Jonathan Lord.
Before being charged against Jonathan Lord, a Caringbah child care employee in 2011, two YMCA N.S.W. employees have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in a statement before the commission, it said it had "never seen a case of child sexual abuse within its organization," the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA accused the YMCA's Caringbah Gym Instructor of children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare, counsel assisting the Commission, told Gayle Farnes that he knew about the case first, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that "the external investigation of the YMCA has been conducted and he has found the YMCA to be at the forefront in the matter of child safety" is also not accurate.
It is the evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Green, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the reason for appointing Lord has failed to manage "including myself" and failed to ensure that the employees were aware of the child safety policy violations related to their responsibilities.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Green denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in YMCA, due to which the employees did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the violation was evidence that Lord was spending time alone with the children, babysitting them in private, sitting them in the lap, telling them that he loved them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and who had asked for child safety training, as she was concerned about her behaviour, testified that the YMCA supervising Lord "Karingbah Child Services Manager Zakya Banat and the "Jakya Banat to the time"
The CEO stated that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not easy to give information above their manager.
He said that, rather than his friendship with the Lord, he misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to the YMCA N.S.W. Mandal that the text for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not giving notice."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees immediately after the allegation was made by YMCA's child services chief administrator Liam Whitele.
He said that its purpose was to avoid mixing the evidence, but it was not "excessively" and correctly executed.
Stephen Smallbone, Special Professor of Child Sexual Exploitation at Griffith University, said that the YMCA was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, supervision, entry, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to be Britain's Prime Minister again - but he believes there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview with the Prime Minister's Office on the occasion of his fifth anniversary, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After quitting his post in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, most of his comments were confined to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and the peace-makers of the Middle East group, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics.
When asked if they would like to return to the Prime Minister's post, Mr Blair was introduced by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but that is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When the crowd of experts performing the horse for the best horse of the year gathered at Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet and taking his first step a few months away, this nine-year-old boy and his palut Shetland's Tattu Taffy easily completed three stages and won the top prize - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition held by the Sunnyback Equistry Centre at the Ruddy near Cardiff, the pair - which is just Sk's length - were highly praised for their appearance, behaviour and style.
In front of the men and women wearing the beautiful baller hat, he threw his flat hat at an angle and circled his two-year-old toffee ring.
For his natural skill in controlling which is far beyond his age, the decision-makers praised Fenton.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and has been practicing with this Shetland tattoo every day since.
Her 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great couple.
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the gold cup and the rozet.
This was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy about his win.
The most different in this landscape, he all felt so amazing that they wanted to take photos with him.
This young child from the village of Nantiglo near Ab Well, South Wales is walking on the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating happiness and playing the talisman."
He was running on bamboo throughout the landscape, and despite looking so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a diva of animals - she loves horses, tractors and farm very much, and she has two chickens that she takes care of.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year a long time ago - and I am confident that he will perform very well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he has come to control his paw."
They are a very good couple.
The decision makers gave marks, considering the manner of Fenton and Toffee's performance and the manner of their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tattu and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.

The Chinese newspaper that argues will be the "revival"
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the front page to leave a reporter guilty of defamation will be reinstated, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that, he had taken bribes to write candid news about the partially owned company of the state.
The regulator said the new express now has to go through a "complete overhaul."
The order for "renewal" came from the Gwangdong Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had printed a lot of false news about the listed company Zoomloyen between September 2012 and August 2013," the company said in a statement.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of the new express was disorderly."
It said it had decided to "administratively impose a penalty by canceling Chen Yongju's reporter's license."
"It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete overhaul of the New Express, commending the people responsible for it in the New Express and immediately revising the leadership team of the New Express."
Mr. Chen had written many articles in New Express blaming financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Jumelion.
After he was stopped, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came on state television, agreeing to write and publish false stories for money.
He told state broadcaster CTV: "In this case, I have harmed Joomla as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people."
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front page apology, stating that it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, a lot of high-profile suspects have made a TV-broadcasted confession.
Experts say that from time to time a conviction is forcefully accepted, despite the fact that a law in the latter half of this year prohibited authorities from forcing a person to convict themselves.

The U.S.-Mexico drug-related train was found in the tunnel.
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-tall three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the same length as the six-foot-tall pitch, connecting Tijuana, a warehouse near Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with a similar warehouse, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said the tunnel had already been shut down before any drugs were passed through.
According to court records, officers have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, about whom officials said they were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he could face sentences ranging from 10 years in prison to life in prison.
Nogales, smugglers in Arizona, take advantage of huge underground water drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the Central Mexican marijuana crop, which poses the challenge of drug mafia groups being able to quickly reach the product to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a route of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, stretching from a kitchen of a house in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.

The British police sent an extradition notice to Asanje.
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, as well as saying that if he failed to do so he would be responsible for being arrested himself.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences, as well as his options under British law expired at a time when the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the U.S., fearing he had asked the South American country for political asylum, on June 19 to seek asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
A spokesperson said that Scotland Yard has "sent a surrender notice to the 40-year-old Assange, for which he was required to appear at the police station at the date and time chosen by us."
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the issue of police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges.
Fine of 1000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) to a car driver at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his feet
On the driver, a fine of 1,000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) has been imposed for driving a car at a speed of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the feet.
Tiptry, 35-year-old Andrew Howey of Essex was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Brentry on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink on their feet.
In the Callchester Magistrates Court, Howie has admitted to the charge of reckless driving.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in him being banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
Tax on foreign property owners, will end the artificial status of London
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but has been waiting for the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who had preferred to keep the house in a company rather than a separate person, for a percentage of the price of more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million in the 2012 budget.
In 2012/13, the stamp duty from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which is already from Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and us from Yorkshire and Wales.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidances Act, it is very difficult to argue that there is less than just tax on high-value property, which is not affected by any old Council tax legislation.
He added that "but this move could make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and unwilling to sell to current owners"
The top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 per cent last year, according to the price in wealthy south-west London.
According to Savills' research, central London's values continued to grow at a steady rate of 5.6 per cent each year, but growing at a slightly lower rate than the "domestic market" as the city's south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) surges are seen.
Scientists have shed more light on the topic of what is the relationship between the actions of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tails more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tails mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the Journal of Cancer Biology.
Georgia Wellertigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions in different ways.”
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that just like humans, the right part of the brain in dogs was responsible for the actions of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two lizards played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral dog movements by other dogs, the researchers looked at animals watching other dogs' films.
He measured the heartbeats of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take much time to understand why their doom sometimes moves to one side or the other.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We introduced dogs to dog films - in the realistic version or in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues that put into confusion, and we could see the action of the tail and present the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw a destitute dog moving its tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail changing direction and turning mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and what they should not.
“If you’ve met other dogs several times, and if they constantly move their tails to one side, it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience,” he said.
The researchers say these findings can provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better information about animal feelings.
John Bradshaw, a visiting professor of dog behaviour at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Unlike the Italian study – when the robot’s tail moved to the left rather than the dog’s right, dogs were more likely to get close to it rather than being restless.”
He said the difference was because in various studies, dogs did not fully understand the sound of animals or robot dogs in movies.
He clarified that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help in this.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be gained - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably won’t take much time to understand why their doom is ever moving on one side or the other.
Alex Turner's disease has caused the Arctic Manche to postpone the Glasgo gig
The rock bank, called Arctic Mankiewicz, has postponed the gig in Glasgow after suffering from its lead singer's knee-jerk injury.
The Sheffield Group's programme was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But the illness of his lead singer Alex Turner forced him to re-schedule the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were forced to postpone the gig at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday in a similar manner.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Mankiz said: After receiving medical advice tonight after the decision to postpone the show in Birmingham LG Arena, the Arctic Mankiz will also be suspended from the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner was found to be knee-deep in the investigation, and they are sadly unable to perform."
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We are sorry for any inconvenience to all ticket-holders.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals, the highest-ranking priests in the Catholic Church, their position is only below the pope, and these are the people who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are currently a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes in the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the celebration of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all the existing cardinals will be held, which is called the pope-summit.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to hold the February papal council, so as to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as many cardinals, and as they wish, announce the name of cardinals over 80 years of age.
Valero said the next year's papal assembly will be important, as it will be the first since France's election in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice against Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new popes, even cardinals from the rest of the world, nominate to restore balance," he said.
There are forty percent Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in the cardinals is very low.
These will also be the first cardinals to be elected after the formation of the Council of Cardinals - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways to reform the church.
Before that, the pope made his own decisions.
"Just now, Frances has chosen these eight cardinals to help her," Valero said.
He said it was "possible" for Francis to seek advice from cardinals.
But we are not in this situation first - it is absolutely new.
Valero said the pope usually gives the bishop of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis was "completely surprising - so we don't know who they will announce the name of."
GM has recalled pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct the seatback
The General Motors Company, its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, has recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a drop in hand-wound seatbacks, according to a U.S. auto safety regulator on Friday.
There may be a reduction in the system of turning the front seats in some trucks.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatback, head restraints.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle gets stuck behind, it is possible that the head restraint, the driver could not properly protect, thus increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began shipping in June and, after the year 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it represents the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker.
G.M. had told truck owners about the fault in the late October.
The N.S.T.M.A. government detention of 16 days, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October, could not review the master notification letter.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sira trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year had increased by 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sira pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, GM's stock surged 1.4 per cent in the New York Stock Exchange.
The Disappointment of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice in the run-up to the election.
He says Obama's great efforts have been hampered by GOP's policy of containment.
Obamacare website's troubles, drone attacks can't be excused
Obama's 2008 campaign's recollection of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading a lot of sad books today.
This is a book that I think will excite me during the second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
Its name is "The Courage to Win," and it is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I find myself reeling from the sheets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics had inspired millions of people and speech could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers paused to show the historical importance of the time.
In the eyes of my classmates were tears of joy, and my parents kept every newspaper they received.
A team of young visionary individuals was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82 percent approval rating when he became President of Obama in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, as if returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
It was the first time I had really changed after the election.
To put it simply, I couldn’t imagine any of it.
I have credited Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our military from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of partisan opposition has stopped many efforts to move our country forward: including immigration reform, public options for health care, closing the dock at Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But many times when I have advocated for the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer I can give them.
I have reached the point of political desperation.
The anti-republican policy is not a response to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot answer the National Security Agency’s collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of those who expose the government’s wrongdoing.
This cannot be explained by the murder of American citizen Anwar L. Avalaki without a trial, nor by the reduction of public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says efforts by the White House to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even three years after it was signed into law under the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government, could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events such as the Newton murder scandal will shape our public debate.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be largely self-chosen by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes that we have been hearing about for a long time.
Still, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
When I look at him, I remember his words.
This week was reading a portion of the book, which described how Clinton had suffered a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they need to return to the track, and stay true to their goals.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We need to remember who we are."
Five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims P.M. Tony Abbott's interest in parental leave scheme is conflicting
The billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the parental leave scheme is a struggle because his daughters can get pregnant, and take advantage of it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be important in determining whether carbon and mining taxes are reduced.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the interest of ministers can be conflicted, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from policies.
"He may have a significant conflict of interest in the case of parental leave awarded, as if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether or not they were granted leave,"" he said."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer demanded the restoration of election counting to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after we have voted?
"We should have a better system,"" he said."
Why can't we have a system where we fill out our dispatch on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because if a person doesn't like it, they can delete it?
The use of pencils in today's era seems absolutely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old said his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he takes his new role "very seriously."
The public office is for public service.
"We don't need any awards other than the awards of history that we can serve the community at this important time," he said.
This caused problems for the protestors.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed intense anger at the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said the fast-growing attacks on lawyers and their families have shown that the culprits have gone unpunished.
They are not afraid of the police and administrative system.
Referring to such incidents that have recently taken place in different places, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily guessed.
RBS suspends two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, learned from two people in the case, this is another indication that the global investigation into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is proceeding at a faster pace than what has been done by regulators.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation-stalking in the world’s largest financial market with a daily exchange of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with the investigation-trial of a case that appears to be a repetition of the Libor Interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation into the matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS had sent the ex-trader and the records of emails and instant messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Usher left RBS in the year 2010, and is believed to have been fired from his current position of European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, went on vacation last week, while former senior traders at Barclays and UBS were suspended by the Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongful act.
The instant message group of Mr. Usher includes Barclays and Bankers of Citigroup.
UBS said, after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finma that it is investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks, it has taken action against some of its employees this week.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority Veco, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - have been investigating allegations of malfeasance in the currency market over bankers.
People familiar with the matter said HSBC, Citygroup, J.P.Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted an internal investigation, or received a request for information from regulators.
Banks have been scrutinizing instant messages and emails for several years in search of clues to a wrong activity.
The news about the investigation-trading, has caused turmoil in the traders of the region, who have been among the leading profit earners in the trading unit of investment banks for the last several years, but they are facing a challenge this year, due to the low volatility in currencies due to fluctuations
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large size of forex buy-sell, there is a disconnection of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of their own platforms by banks, which means that “you have to start making a small impact on the market”.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse had announced that the trader would be discharged from its exchange-traded funds desk in London this week, which had lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said, "We are confident that the trader acted alone, and he has been controlled."
Students studying other courses, including technical and management courses, will be able to exercise their suffrage this time.
The University Chancellor has written a letter to the Governor for permission to hold elections.
With the start of the admission process at the university, the demand for student union elections began to rise.
He had also launched a signature campaign on the selection of his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
Students entering nearly two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Biosciences, Tourism Management and Paramedical Sciences, will be able to choose their representative this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar said that the Governor has sought permission to conduct elections at the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as permission is granted.
It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges, he said.
Many college managers don't want their campus to have student union elections.
However, due to lack of unity among the students, there are no elections.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the election.

After Diwali, the district administration will be asked to allow elections to be held in colleges.
There are also problems with the college's view on the student union elections.
On Dhanteras, people have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from utensils in the capital.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent compared to last year.
There were long queues at jewellery shops in Shimla.
From the lower market to the mall road, there was also a huge crowd in the grocery stores.
Although the price of such items was rising this year, people still did not show any willingness to buy on auspicious occasion.
Aubhu Muhart for shopping on Friday was held from 7:52 a.m. to 10:12 a.m. and from 1:56 a.m. to 3:37 p.m. and from 6:17 a.m. to 8:12 p.m.
At the time of the said three muhurts, more crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla were flocking for more purchases.
In the Shimla lower market, people could not find a place to stand.
The crowd in every small shop looked the same.
In such a case, when purchases on Dhanteras celebrated as Triyodshi Dhantriodshi of the Kartik month are signs of Shubh Deepawali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of the separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act – under which citizens would be required to purchase or pay health insurance before 2014 – that it was constitutional under the government’s power to impose tax.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court has also supported the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, saying that the condition of the health care law that the state increase in medicated eligibility or they will provide all federal medicated funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states, and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates during the initial session of 2012, including projective nominees Mitt Romney.
It is true that our work cannot go on without money.
Money for life is one of the greatest needs, but it is not in our interest to value everything.
We celebrate Krishna Triodshi of Karthik month as Dhanteras.
Dhanteras is worshipped by the god of wealth Kuber and the god of death, Yamraj.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
We have a bad feeling about money.
Nothing can be more valuable than the money that has come for the welfare of mankind, but the money that has been the cause of egotism has no meaning.
Let us earn money for the holy purpose and spend it for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the tendency of unaccountable accumulation or earning Yen-Kin-type money destroys our conscience, our personality.
The spirit of giving should always be in the mind.
A portion of the money you give can also form the basis of someone's life or livelihood.
We should all think about the many people in society who are living in dire need.
In fact, meaning, religion, work, and moxie have been given equal importance in the masculinities of life.
All people wish for wealth and success, and only according to their manhood do they get wealth and success.
It is the same wealth that is sustainable with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may become, he cannot consume it properly nor can he do the work of another.
If you have money, don't give it to anyone else.
It is the true rich who make their way into the many hands of wealth.
There can be no greater use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Money is not just money as money.
It would also be like your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

After the general election, the new government will not get kerosene at these stores in half a dozen states if it continues its policy to stop selling kerosene through ration.
The states in which kerosene sales are to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, some states in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the Northeast are also preparing to close the sale of kerosene.
According to the sources of the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to close the sale of kerosene at PDS stores in the states on two bases.
The first base is fast power connection being made in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene to most rural families in the states that have been given kitchen gas connections is being stopped.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made a thorough preparation in this regard.
Sales of PDS kerosene in Delhi have already stopped since October, 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been significantly reduced for Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to 1 lakh kg.
Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 per cent to 70 per cent in the allocation of Uttarakhand.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of kerosene spillage from these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene is being used for blending.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel currently stands at Rs 37.
This is to encourage those who are involved.
In the states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.
The accused, citing the trading firm, used to forge in the name of buying and selling shares by opening investor accounts.
This is probably the first time that such a revelation has come to light in the state with a scam of crores of rupees.
The police have not yet reached the spot, but seven people, including the accused, have been arrested by the police.
The group operated a fake commodity market called Metatrader-5.
The actors of the company used to create a fake ID on a fake software by taking money from investors.
When trading, the shares bought by the investors were seen by the accused.
It was up to him to find out at what price the shares were bought.
In fact, neither a stock was bought nor there was any transaction for it, as no demat account of the investors was opened and the shares were falsely displayed on this fake software.
The police are suspecting that hundreds of people have come to the spot.
Every investor was invested between two and five lakh rupees in the name of making a profit.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been arrested by Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while his six other accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
After that, the company can trade shares through its investors.
Then the investor's debit account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company named Metatrader-5 was neither affiliated with any exchange nor traded stock.
The company had purchased the server for itself in the name of Wintrade on September 24, 2012 citing trading.
Since then, people have been chanting in the name of investment through this company.
Eight traders from Indore have come forward to file a complaint in the cyber cell.
Even after selling his purchased shares in profit, his amount was not transferred to his account.
On this, he started demanding the profit amount from the actors of the company.
Investors are even saying that the price of the shares they bought was always lower on the fake ID given to them.
This price was decided by the accused at his level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Maharashtra.
Agents advised people to join this company by giving more profit to greed.
After that, two lakhs were deposited from one to five lakhs.

In such cases, all employees are forced to work in fear of an accident.
There is an atmosphere of terror in the staff working from the roofs of this building.
The building, which was built in 1913, was the first municipal corporation's office in the city.
The building was handed over to the Electricity Board in the year 1995.
In the name of its repairer, the department is spraying Palla with paint.
The condition of the building is so bad that employees are also afraid to sit in it.

NEW DELHI: BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday addressed an election rally in Pune to inaugurate a section of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital in Pune.
"""There was a coalition government in many states and centres of the country, a Congress government, a Communist government and a BJP government,"" Modi said."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I appeal to the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What the team did.
If this results in a comparative result, then the country will not have the question of whether the BJP government should come.
Whenever the BJP government is formed, efforts are being made to meet the aspirations of the people.
This country witnessed low inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food for two hours.
But when a Congress-backed government was formed, the poor man did not deserve to be fed.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader, is responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media of our country cannot reach them.
The Congress is proud of it.
They don't even respond to the media.
The election is for the Lok Sabha, you answer the people.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "Today, questions are being asked of Modi. When the people bless the BJP in 2014, they will present their work to the public every year.
In a democracy, not a ruler, a servant should sit.
There should be no Naths in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Friends of the Congress continue to leave the balloons in the coming days.
We've already had a test 10 years ago.
In a democracy, the people take the lead.
In the case of Nortel patents, an economic lawsuit has been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, which owns thousands of ex-Nortel patents, on Thursday filed multiple patent suits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it had overturned in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Association, which purchased Norretel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven of its patents.
The suit said these patents also include technology that combines words that are searched on the Internet with words that are associated with advertising, which is a major part of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely opposed to Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google had placed an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google eventually proposed a $4.4 billion bid, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in the Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons why Motorola had a long list of patents.
The prosecution said that "despite Google's efforts to acquire the patents-in-suit in the auction, it has violated, and is constantly violating,"
Rockstar has sought increased damages against Google, as it claims that Google's violation of patents is frivolous.
Belief in Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his victory day could hardly end the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi, who replaced Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago, promised a "new Egypt" while taking the oath of office as the country's first freely elected president.
On his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the Arab world's independently elected first Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth president since the removal of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office in front of 18 judges who were blacklisted by the court on their chair on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television, Morsi said, "We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its establishment as an illegal organisation and has been on the trail of previous governments, said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the U.S. party, "Today, the people of Egypt have a new life.
Hundreds of soldiers and police secured the building and arrived in Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, away from the President's smokehouse, traffic was also stopped for a short time, so that his convoy of motorists would leave the generally busy road that runs south from the city centre to the centre of the city.
Brotherhood's non-charity as a "underwear" has greatly enhanced Morsi's personal prestige after his victory and on Friday his speech presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate of all those who want to end the 2011 dictatorship of Mubarak.
Wearing a business suit of blue and a red tie, Morsi, sworn in before judges sitting in a wooden paneled chamber, said that "today Egypt is a citizen, a national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, he went to Morsi Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band played the national anthem and were officially welcomed while they were standing in the currency of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture hall at the main university there welcomed with the slogan that "the army and people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as the stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became the stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tehreek Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's reign of tyranny last year, and the oath to withdraw presidential powers taken from him by the military council from the leader who was removed last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court rather than taking the competent oath of Parliament in practice, they bow down to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tehreek Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases, U.S. intelligence has crossed the line.
At the same time, he claimed that innocent people have not been harassed under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry's confession came out during his address to the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.

Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its purpose is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in people that has been hurt by the revelation of mass phone tapes.
The Senate's move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also blocked the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) by 4 votes to 11 against the NSA.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone taping under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, its use would be considered an offence by knowingly collecting unauthorized data and a sentence of imprisonment of 10 years has been provided for.
The bill will become a law after it passes in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
"The NSA's phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country,"" committee chairman and senator Diane Festin said."
But in spite of this, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only that, the privacy of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, the NSA's Internet surveillance program has been revealed by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook in support of the bill.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs who are scrambling to record NSA's large-scale phone call.
It is worth noting that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the veil from the NSA's actions.
The international community is outraged at the NSA's disclosure of surveillance of the telephone conversations of the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

So you thought travel agents were the last century, thank you to the Internet?
The flight center is moving ahead with this trend.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects the full year before tax to be between $325 million to $340 million, compared with the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the target is achieved as per the current guidance, this would be a 12 to 17 per cent increase in the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in the year 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said the flight centre has made an 8 per cent profit in the first half, and made a good start in its second half, especially on non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
"So far, our 10 countries are in profits, and many countries, interest and tax contributions are on track for full-year income," he said.

According to a recent media report, the NSA flew information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named-Muscularer, which it co-hosted with its British counterpart-GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data from a vast fiber-optic cable network under the cover of Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post, citing a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013, said more than 18 crore documents were collected in just 30 days of the programme's launch.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the operation was launched out of the US and a benami telecommunications provider helped the NSA to gain access to this information.
It was easier for the NSA to run the program outside the US, according to the newspaper, as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
"NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, ""As far as I know, this has never happened."
The NSA has always collected all information within the scope of the law.
The NSA had recently been targeted for spying on the German chancellor.

Students in English literature courses will need to read at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British history after 1914.
The exam will also include "unseen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be completed.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate G.C.S.E. in the language, and will be very motivated to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects to feature revolutionary changes.
This will also change in other key areas next year.
In a separate step, the exam will showcase the changes taking place in the structure of the GCSE with the regulatory off-the-shelf, new grading system, and lower course.
Speaking in the heat, Education Secretary Michael Goa had said that "there was much more consensus that, in order to restore people's trust, we need to improve our own examination system" he said that "GCSE will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time in mathematics - 116 hours per year or - 3 hours per week less during a session than in most countries.
According to comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours per year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal requirement to give mathematics more time, the alliance sources said that the broader mathematics GCSEs - League Tables were likely to encourage the provision of additional education in schools, with subjects being combined for greater weight.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems" including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court has refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it cannot tell the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said Asaram is being called Drakula in the case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments that you can use.
Asaram's lawyer said that there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but especially there are two channels that make them more troublesome.
These people are demoting their image and reporting unilaterally.
The right of Asaram should be protected in this case.
The court refused to bar the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Pawan Bansal, surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, put the opposition in one place by saying that he had not seen anyone's wife in 15 years.
After that, everyone was surprised at where the woman’s talk finally came from.
Perhaps Bansal's hint was towards a big BJP leader and a councilman's domestic relations.
Turning the matter over, Bansal told reporters that during the last parliamentary election, the BJP had conspired to make a complaint against a woman who could not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI has questioned him in the railway bribery case.
If they were made a witness in the case, would it have been made only after a full investigation?
Bansal said he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam they are talking about.
If that is their sin, they will continue to do so forever.
He said that although the Corporation had no constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the Opposition to speak.
As far as the development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development work.
They cannot even think about the way Chandigarh is or is going to develop.
The two exchanged greetings at the meeting of the Cabinet.
When the meeting was over, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said about his speech that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges have to be tackled.
It was also on the Chief Minister's face that he took Singh's speech positively.
Singh had asked the Chief Minister to pay respect to the workers at the Chintan camp and to protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he also said that he was ready to resign from the cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, there is hope for fresh consideration in the matter of seating the workers on government posts after the opinion emerged in the think tank camp.
At the camp, state JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of nomination of workers in the 20 Souti Committees would be announced soon.
He also said that the list is almost complete.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is expected to make the list at his own level.
They will also examine whether MLAs-Parliamentarians have taken the view in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be extensively revised to accommodate older and committed workers.
Lawmakers and MPs are commonly accused of not taking their views into account in making a list of nominations.
The names of those who came from other parties much later have been added to the list, while many important activists who have been active since the days of the Samata Party have been ignored.
Some people are born with silver sponges, some make life a model by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is Dhirubhai Ambani, who is also known by his name.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhanas Ambani, who was a teacher at a school in Choravad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Among the five siblings, Dhirubhai was the third.
The five children of the family include Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to economic stress, Dhirubhai had to leave school only after high school.
Dhirubhai had started providing financial assistance to the household in his childhood.
At this time they used to set up a shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Dhirubhai's first job was on a ship called Kabota at the age of 17 in 1949, when he arrived in the Yemeni city of Aden.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had put all arrangements in place for him, so he did not have any trouble getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai’s mind.
So they returned to Vatna in 1954.
In 1955, he was lucky enough to reach Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket.
This is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took steps that he never looked back.
His name was not only famous in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he owned Rs 62,000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of his sultanate.
Like his father, the name of these two brothers is also among the international businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

The state government is going to triple the tax on repellents, mats, liquids used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal to raise taxes will be put before the Cabinet soon.
The government, which is struggling with the financial crisis, is looking for every possible way to increase its earnings these days.
The Resource Committee has been chaired by the Minister of Urban Development, Mohammad Azam Khan, for improving the financial health of the government.
According to sources, among the many tax-enhancing proposals in the recent Resource Committee meeting, the committee rejected them, which would have a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given a green flag to the proposal to raise taxes on mosquito-killing repellents, quails, mats and liquids.
It is proposed to triple the tax on them.
Currently, four per cent VAT and one per cent additional tax have been levied on them.
Now 12.50 per cent VAT and 1.50 per cent additional tax are proposed.
The government is expected to get an additional revenue of Rs 14 crore.
The Department of Commerce has been in favour of raising the tax rate on the Tendu card from 5 per cent to 14 per cent, but the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The committee believes that the tendu leaf is used to make the bee that people in the lower classes drink.
Similarly, the committee has not yet given a green flag to increase the tax on transmission wire etc., saying that this could have an impact on the general public due to the high cost of electricity.
The committee also did not accept the proposal on green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.
Congress leader Chadveer Hooda on Friday made public contacts in Sector 21 and village Maheshpur.
During this time, the people were invited to the rally and handed over the responsibility.
Chadveer has also laid down duties for the workers.
Chhadveer Hooda said that the amount of crores of rupees has been spent by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the district.
Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has spent Rs 15 crore in the last four years in the Panchayats of the Barwala section.
"Chadveer Hooda said the party workers are ""very excited"" about the rally at the Chief Minister's call and the rally will be ""reinforced"" by all the rallies so far and will elevate the political stature of Haryana across the country."
The Chief Minister, who has achieved popularity in the direction of historical decisions and public interest activities in the state, will wear the crown of power to the people of the state for the third time, Chadveer said.

Preparations for this in the home and markets have reached the final stage.
The city's main markets are Bapu Bazaar, Ashwini Bazaar, Sarafa Market, Bharabhuja Valley, Sindhi Bazaar, etc. to double the celebrations of the city's people.
Traders have also made special preparations at their showroom for the convenience of customers.
At the same time, the festive atmosphere led to a situation of jamming in the main markets several times a day.
Several trade organisations have been involved in the controversy over the decoration of Diwali.
Sectors 4, 5, 6 and 14 of the suburban areas were also decorated in the main markets.
Shopping in these markets continued on the eve of Dhanteras.
On Thursday, sales of pujan materials, diya and lighting items were particularly high.
Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: The police have allegedly removed the security of former Congress minister Ghulam Hasan Khan from the People's Democratic Party.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security had been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hasan Khan Mufti Muhammad Saeed, who won the 2002 election on PDP ticket from Shopian, was a member of his cabinet while he was chief minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said that I have been wearing a safety jacket since 1996.
I live in what are known as the "Gardens of Terror."
A security document of CRPF at my house was posted under the direction of the Sub Inspector.
I also have bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly taken away on Veerwar.
When the security document was going from my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he said only that he would investigate the matter.
Incidentally, when contacted by the IGP of Kashmir Abdul Ghani Mir, he denied the information of the case, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will examine for myself how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has finally been removed.
State Congress chief Prof Saifudin Soj said that there is nothing in my information.
It is a very serious matter if Hasan Khan has been compromised with security.
I am currently in Jammu and am coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA's rule (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Bajpayee's tenure as Prime Minister came a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
While laying the foundation stone of a 182-metre-high statue of Sardar Patel in Kevadia, Gujarat, Modi said there had been no announcement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
UPA has spent Rs 4.10 crore in 2009-10, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
UPA did not get any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the Jayanthas and dignitaries of Nehru-Gandhi family members each year.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about this difference from Manish Tiwari, he said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of an ad depends on many things, including the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which the people who oppose it are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, security has been tightened on all sides in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's repeated visit to Patna.
The police conducted a thorough search of Modi's itinerary and meeting places.
The police will take a look at the people attending the meetings.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police Security will be monitored.
Modis security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the BJP's bone-crushing journey in connection with the Patna blasts.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP is in the process of destroying the environment.
Moving forward from land, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. George Welle, is delivering free health care in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients on almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or give via mobile.
Dr. George Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or make someone a CNN year hero in the top 10.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Welle had seen his ailing father come to his senses and unconscious, going to the hospital, which was not adequately equipped to assist him.
Jameel Welle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde, in 1981.
At first, he only had his hand broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he produced blood clots that affected his rest of his life.
George Well says, "There was no neurogenesis in Cameroon."
If we had the money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Wells kept circling huge crowds of clinics and hospitals about his father and getting whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5 a.m. hoping that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait and die in the face of death.
There hasn't been much change in the situation since Well's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
If you compare, there is one doctor for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon can't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of healthcare spending in the country is in the private sector.
Well says, "The only problem they have is poverty."
And because of being poor, they can’t take pleasure in their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well made a firm resolve to do something about it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgical treatments in the last year.
He also became a physician himself, and began to work as a vascular surgeon at Yonde's Center Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Escoviam, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they sit in a van and about 30 people, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes they don't even get along with them.
They have to push the vehicle forward more than once from the rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that can be offered by the community.
The free medical service in these villages is really a cause for celebration, and well-being - with its big smile and endless energy - includes joy and happiness.
The next morning, his team began to meet with hundreds of patients.
"We are meeting 500 people on each trip,"" Well said."
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come for a walk.
All of these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people may get bribes, donated glasses or free birth certificates -- this document is required in school but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery-treatment with local anesthesia.
The operation is usually done in the school building, town hall or at home; after the procedure, the patient goes to the place of recovery, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes in the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Wells and his volunteers wake up and work on Sunday mornings.
It's a slow pace, but village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
"They've been playing drums all night to keep us awake and carry on their work,"" Well said."
On Sunday their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has received 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said he would be able to go back to work due to receiving free hernia surgery treatment.
He said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon-physician in the hospital, well at night also work in a private medical clinic around the genitals.
He said this is his second job that funds 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed with a private donation.
"I don't know when they're asleep," said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Wells group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity for them that they can never get in their own country.
"We have been able to gain experimental experience in the field of medical devices that we assist in holding instruments for Dr. Welle or cleaning blood stains," O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you will never get the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend by themselves to reach the Cameroons, and they often come up with medical supplies of donations.
But after the arrival of the jounds, their stay, and the cost of the instructions are well worth it.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For the well, almost the same work load, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
Well says, “I am very happy when I do this work.”
And I think about my father.
I hope they’ll see what I’m doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Take a look at Escoviam's website and find out how to help.
You may not be sure, but it is true.
Not only that, Mission Road has been named after Nagar Parshad president Anjali Kumari.
In fact, Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named it to express his anger over some of the city's bad roads.
The event was conducted under the leadership of J&M Central Secretary Sachidanand Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
"The Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media,"" he said."
Manmohan Singh is the prime minister and his government, yet he needs a response from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the public.
Clearly, Modi was replying to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wanted an atmosphere of his own where he gives his speech and does not speak to him to avoid questions from journalists.
Sibal also challenged Modi to face a debate.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP government is formed in 2014, we will present the report to the people every year,"" Modi said."

Obama's health care offer has been withdrawn.
Amid a shower of criticism, President Obama retracted his often-repeated false promise yesterday that "if you like your health plan, you can continue it."
In addition to receiving cancellation notifications from their providers by millions of people, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and it's useful, can continue it."
Addressing what he calls the “thumb of news,” Obama has graced the U.S. citizens who receive this information with the purchase of new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much money or even a comprehensive health care plan cheaper than proposed.
You will get a better deal, he said.
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that the 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance themselves with their money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage, affordable care does not meet the required standards under the Act.
In a statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Vancouver, Mr. Sabellius said, "I am telling these American citizens directly, 'You deserve better than this.'
Sabellius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market from October has been "unfortunate."
"I'm just as disappointed and angry as other people," he said.
I want to get your trust back.

A case has been registered against the trader seeking a refund of Rs 2 lakh.
The girl has been threatened to be raised if she does not give the money.
Efforts are being made to resolve the case at Hoodkeshwar police station under the guise of a cyber-crime cell.
Ayodhya is the electronics shop of Narendra Bahad (21), a resident of the city of Ayodhya.
Between the 25th and 29th, someone called from different mobile numbers on their mobile phone.
The phone caller demanded Rs 2 lakh as ransom.
If he does not give it, he is threatened with death or raising his daughter.
Narendra did not take this threat seriously at first, but when the number of threats increased and the matter came to the student's daughter in class 12th, they got upset.
Family members are in fear.
The complaint was filed on Thursday.
No trace of the accused has been found yet.
In view of the seriousness of the case, the cyber-crime cell is being taken care of.
In addition, MP Badal also directed the authorities on the spot to listen to the difficulties of the people in the villages of Bhagiwander, Bandar Patti, Lalayana, Jajal, Fullokhari, Gatwali and Malkana for their solution.
The MP also issued a grant for the development of villages.
He ordered the Panchayat to make proper use of the grant issued for the development of the villages so that the villagers could get facilities. He took stock of the ongoing paddy procurement schemes in the village Bhagiwander.
He gave a sewing machine, plant and certificate to 15 girls who had received sewing training.

As a result, there has been a decrease in cases of violation of the Code of Conduct.
Since the Election Code of Conduct came into force on October 4, 313 cases have been registered against various political parties till October 21.
As many as 31 cases have been reported from October 22 to 27.
With the implementation of the Election Code of Conduct, cases of its violation had also started.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but the audacity and audacity of it began to decline.
It is being reported that in the early days due to not having full information about the Code of Conduct, there were more complaints against political parties.
Fewer complaints are now being made by the Election Commission due to raising awareness of political parties and taking lessons from the recorded case.
Many parties were campaigning as before in the absence of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said the U.S. spying "has inappropriately gone too far."
John Kerry has unexpectedly signaled the U.S.'s protective stance on its surveillance program by admitting it "inappropriately goes too far."
The State Minister has also admitted that he and Barack Obama are also guilty in the case of being on "automated pilot" in the face of the informer Edward Snowden's exposure to NSA's spying activities.
This secrecy has led the U.S. government to carry out diplomatic ground operations in relation to its allied countries.
Speaking through a video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There was no question that the President, me, and others in the government really knew about some of the things that happened with the automatic pilot, because look back on the Second World War, and the difficult years of the Cold War, from 9/11 onwards, and beyond.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that U.S. spying has stretched its limits, but have insisted that no one’s rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone way too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is currently conducting an in-depth review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was an effort for good purpose, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many people.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves,"" he added."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people by blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the plane from actually falling down, the buildings being destroyed, and people being killed because we have been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that the U.S. legislators will go to Europe to help resolve concerns abroad about so-called U.S. spying, and the European countries will continue to commit corruption along with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of his involvement in anti-terror organisations being blocked by Kuntha over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
The Democratic Party was elected for the first time and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, Murphy, in an interview with Washington said, "It is really important for U.S. national security interests that our European country with regard to our counter-terrorism efforts"
European countries need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
The news of the recording of millions of phone conversations by the NSA in Europe has led to the U.S. collusion with some of its allies, though the agency's head said the news was not entirely correct, and that the United Nations was collusion with the NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper, defending the incident of spying on allied countries, called it necessary and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the storm, Murphy said his office is arranging a visit to the Congress, which is likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating law-makers will be released in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme is still being worked on.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to improve relationships, he said that some "impractical relationships" must also be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will also have to be honest with their people about their spying programs that have been used for years.
"While we can modify our surveillance programme to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
This weekend, Mr. Carrie is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland, where she will address the hatred about U.S. surveillance activities from the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy of changing the board in the municipalities has started.
Recently, the party of Congress-led councillors in the Saithia municipality of Veerbhum district was transformed into the Trinamool Board due to the change of the party.
The change came as most of the councillors, including the mayor, joined the Trinamool Congress.
Not only the Congress but also some councilors of the CPI(M), BSP and Forward Block have also stopped the Trinamool movement here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai hails it as a good sign for the party.
He said 10 councilors of the Congress, including the chairman of the Saithia Municipal Corporation Virender Parikh and the leader of the Congress Viplav Dutta, had joined the Trinamool.
Some councilors of the Left, including the CPI-M, have also hoisted the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and according to the number force, the Sanitia Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that all agree with what has been decided on the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including the Congress, CPI-M, CPI-M, and Forward Block are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Welcome to the Trinamool of any party's eligible leaders.
Due to the change of the party of Congress councilors in the Saithia municipality before the elections of the five municipalities on November 22, the possession of Trinamool on the municipal board is considered to be important in the political circles.
Earlier, the occupation of Trinamool on the Congress-ruled Palika Board in Haldia and Nadia was an example of this.
When Trinamool is occupied on the Municipal Board in the districts due to the change of party, those who join the party are warmly welcomed at Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai has split from other parties and is excited to join the Trinamool Congress.
He said, "The people who are in the middle of the party are welcome to join the party.
He claims that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is growing, which results in people wanting to join the Trinamool Congress.
However, the main opposition party CPI(M) says other party leaders are being intimidated and intimidated.
Fearing the terror of the Trinamool Congress, people are joining in.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen as a blow to the CPI-M democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its power, but it is legitimate to question the justification for changing the views of the government.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thai Jail Term
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Fukut for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Fukut Provincial Court found Steve Russell Bomford guilty of falsely accusing the Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver had attempted to stop him along with two other persons on the morning of Sunday, June 10.
But later, CCTV footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel in a safe manner after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
He admitted to making the story after being interrogated by the Fuquet police for two days.
He was taken to the local police station before being heard in the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in jail at a low security detention centre in the outer area of Fuquet rather than an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tonks, who has applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about taking care of their daughter and wanted to call her back to Australia.
"This has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope he will be back home as soon as possible."
Bamfod has appealed against the sentencing order, and bail has been secured on 50,000 bribes.
Meanwhile, the report in Australia said that she was celebrating her holidays at a place celebrating Crabby's holiday in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Fukut, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentencing order by up to two years and force him to remain in adult prison.
By the way, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be guilty of trying to improve its poor tourist image.
