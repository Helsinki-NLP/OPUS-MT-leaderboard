To the members of the Assembly of Wales concerned "that they should be taken as monikers"
Disturbing among some of the members of the Assembly, now known as AM, by the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate was sparked by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all over the world fear being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the Welsh Parliament name.
Regarding the AM title issue, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received majority support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could turn out to be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would make the case for the vote to be omitted.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent as Harlem churches continue to fight
“The elders I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Not one thing, not the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
“Now people socialize in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods people usually go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets won’t last as long as leaders expect, and “they will sooner or later go back to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation made the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street stores, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and ascending to black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly christened the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who replaced it with the larger carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin in recent months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the body that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "intends to pass on the costs" to the council, although it did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a boy while fishing for lobster in California
Police said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the first day of the season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel narrated to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help screaming, at which point he swam with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only excitement to fish a lobster, but that he soon realized he was shouting "I got caught!
They caught me!’
He had his collarbone smashed." Hammel said he noticed when he reached for the boy.
“I told everyone out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had seen a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty brokers similar to the big warehouses full of expert assistants.
As part of the sizable <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion dive into the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the largest beauty aisles will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country, and then move on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are fit for vegans, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the former opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the latter will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly resemble shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, as it bought the two chains two years ago. This apparently boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business consisting of 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the image of our beauty brokers to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to suit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old buying habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has gone "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for his homewear and accessories brand Truly.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning anchor used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones sparking as he pulled out of his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate Jones was "angry" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at her corporate empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to the homewear and accessories brand of both, Truly.
The business came to be compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the project stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow’s offices ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of the host of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and textiles for the home, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were going on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we should not comment on his business affairs."
It’s a complicated conversation and then we fall in love.
He joked with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump has called his voice a “newspaper presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pounds after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things are going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing home the remaining U.S. troops.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we’d have about 200 people over here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd that was right in front of him.
An earthquake and a tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they would not seek international aid, so it is a challenge,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other shores.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo’s election campaign has revolved around improving Indonesia’s deteriorating infrastructure, and has produced money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is affected by a huge lack of funds in the final straight to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before shooting the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced toward the top left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping in the air and entering the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, to get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came up to Kante and they give a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 on break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near mid-shift and entering the Liverpool pitch.
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second stick scoring with a shot with the left that Alisson Becker was not able to stop.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the national disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the rubble of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press round the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with rubble from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Died of Cowardice
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area to see or hear something from them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call to contact anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the control panel who contacts us, as they may have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighbouring Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again until within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There was a woman on the scene crying.
I keep saying, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing September 30 registration 247.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "shoot" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
They may have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the view that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to still deserve homage.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese farmer is killed by a killer pig.
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a courtyard in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put the swine vaccines into a cortege on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to another adjacent courtyard.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer until it was killed.
“My cousin had his legs bloody and bruised,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence on stage.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs attacking humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kilogram pig hurled a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “shooter.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they have no intention of doing harm.
“You just have to have the respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rains to the southwest of the U.S.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it flies over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern Time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture northward, penetrating the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with valcade will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause rainfall that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in punctual areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canyons that could become floating rivers, and electric storms will bring locally raked winds and dust.
The valcade will bring locally heavy rains to parts of California’s southern coast.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of minor debris and rough roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends into late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive in Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we will be able to see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimony of Supreme Court-appointed judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a late Friday night news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh had touched him while drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch television from offices.
To get an idea, it’s an audience similar to a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's show.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by protesters as he tried to enter a lift on the way to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
“I’m here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
They said, "You have power as long as there are many helpless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement before the elevator closed, adding that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable broadcast live hours after the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, prompting a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his on the cover of the paper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the tariffs from the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a man suspected of carrying out the shootings that ended in the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge.
Officials broadcast the video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense said it had a $350,000 bond.
The East Baton Rouge parish coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's fugitive unit, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 winger was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season’s average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that the team was "defeated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Grey-winged volcano over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity in the crater was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunders and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between Catalan police and separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists contained by riot police grunted them with eggs and powder paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that day with the police, who used the sticks to contain the lyorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "neither forget nor forgive" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be taken care of by minor injuries received at the protest, according to local press.
Tension continues to flare in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, though deemed illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although participation was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration was also held, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote, but now we are exhausted,” he said.
Despite achieving a balanced, albeit decisive victory in last December’s regional elections, this year Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year he would run for election to the European Parliament.
"Introducing myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: A man is arrested after a car slammed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed several times into a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (UK daylight saving time).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the entanglement and the building itself to be the damaged parts.
It is also possible that a good shot was fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise one level after Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remains unscathed this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston remains undefeated in the division for the sixth straight game; head coach Holt has not yet known defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler or me.
Livingston misses opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team must have come a long way before they scored, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross shot didn't cross the goal line; then Alan Lithgow's shot came off driven by a Craig Halkett header from the other side of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in stopped ball games.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston made a draw in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to secure the Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession but faced an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from guard Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage of Kelly.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor caught Scott Pittman with the weight of a shot, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another play to Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross passes were issued in the Livingston area which were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and one by a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont to BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
“They have been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the credit is Holt's for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly directed a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not a single breath in the entire game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well at times under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
The last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. An entire call to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when collided with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision that involved a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. (UK daylight saving time).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway crash on Childers Street just over a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
There are road closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation at a high-security prison, according to the prison official.
The riot began at Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin at around 09:30 a.m. (UK daylight saving time) on Sunday and is still going on.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been defaced to face a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and they could spend more time between bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it became known that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to quell a riot in which staff were assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (places hit by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that she will arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that stretched over a 64-kilometer radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service provide for 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n border of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Gran Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
“Total precipitation is expected to range from 75 to 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can be found at up to 250 l/m2,” reports weather.com.
Rosa then heads north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continues up through Arizona and enters southern Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is hoped that these rains could cause sudden water storms and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in order to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4 a.m. (UK daylight saving time).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to police in Somerset, three 17-, 18- and 20-year-old boys were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, respectively.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the phone of the incident.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered the Wickedness and Anger' of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the Democratic Party’s desperate and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the squalor and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charge.
The president said Saturday that the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality, and bravery.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a record of impeccable public service,” he said, addressing a crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump has argued that the Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican Party aide told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on land to the Luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the threat arose, the people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were killed,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, house, it wiped out everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many tents and buildings destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) has declared that the energy released by Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, set at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantitative" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a fan recording shared on social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building shouting frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water collides against the shore carrying forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major outage that cut communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Officials say the army has already begun shipping cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami is more than 800.
It's terrible.
On the way through the World Vision staff to reach the city of Palu, where employees retreat to canvas shelters erected in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of starting assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing them from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian aid workers with great knowledge and experience.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘All right, this is a national disaster,’ we can open ourselves up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
Falling the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of the missing were clinging to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would smooth out the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a sink.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only one grey mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he added.
They steal $26,750 while recharging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, burglars stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was recharging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, investigative officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier in the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known as Kanye West.”
For some time now, West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
It will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said that same year as he talked about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means the one, only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he would prefer to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also mastered putting on and taking off the script and using the capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, vowed not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in I.A.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicateing the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that the other countries are much further behind the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later became an executive at Google's subsidiary in China's Microsoft Research.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“China is not leading the academic leaders, but the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not registered a move for months.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum if the country's name is changed.
The Macedonian people voted Sunday in a referendum to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised questions about whether the result would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, allege that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I voted for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the outcome of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been registered at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television chain Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to go to the polls on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May.
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire defence of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over Brighton's defence with Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the 65th minute goal.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke away from a defense before overtaking several more on the Brighton area's edge.
He then passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The forward used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems in the chest," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’re going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the opening lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field at that game.
He sent a beautiful pass into the void on the right-hand side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The blue-collars put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to give the Rockies a party
With the Nationals out of the fight for elimination, there wasn’t much reason to force another ownership.
But an always-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still qualifier implications for the Rockies, who take an advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I’ve played this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will open on Sunday, but appear to be leaning towards Scherzer being the pitcher in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely launch Sunday on his usual day off.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court-elect, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing... I don’t do it, but I really do and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means necessary, evil, and meanness.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, above who they have to go to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’ll never give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to stand up and stand in the way."
“And they’ve seen that for the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “anxious, boastful, greedy, and lying.”
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong apprehensions from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that it didn’t surprise me too much.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs that we are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually on issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that’s no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long since been forgotten, if at all.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom he believed shared a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions with which he would never agree, whether in terms of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact somewhat the same as I say, there is a tremendous uproar and attacks on social networks censoring center politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know I’m luckier than some of my peers, as the comments that come to me are usually political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needed to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of "no confidence" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in scope.
Over the last few years I have received many advices that urge me to keep my head down, to be less frank and that then "everything would go well for me".
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, driven by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that had literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
“No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr is put on the head
It is possible that the last two attempts changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this pleasant match of the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far they have put us to the test in our games and we remain undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said, “We have to admit that Ayr took advantage of opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers to speak and Jason Baggot missed a wrong pitch.
Clim<0xC3><0xB3> increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the halftime, he turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor at rest.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a padil and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through an essay by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a Bruce Colvine essay that was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the local team's fifth try.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to enter the restaurant industry after discovering he has been named director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems that Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
‘The sea is ours’: Inner Bolivia expects the court to pave the way to the Pacific
The sailors were guarding a naval headquarters covered with appliances in La Paz.
The public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned by the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
In sealess Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 19th century remains alive, as does the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on Oct. 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia’s concession of a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the right, and that little would change if this were to happen.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX ruling comes just six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says Chilean expert in international law Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be lagging behind.
“The issue of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, had been using this issue for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, says his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a utopia" that the continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that ends the Korean War can bend to the North.
In Washington, they refuse to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely cover yourself with the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalk a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that wowed the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought to the catwalk their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide flap imitating feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Among other large accessories there were adorned watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with glasses and the tube, and the other a melted ice cone.
And if you're a huge fan of fashion, you're in luck.
The fashionistas predicted that the giant hats could reach the stores.
Disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb," the 60-centimeter ball hat that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the catwalk another great creation: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the model dressed in a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and topped with a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope the big hats and beach bags will arrive in stores next summer, as the designer has had such a huge impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it gets to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will come to your heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an outstanding degree.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honours enrolment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language skills, 17% of the reasons why employers have to cover vacancies are due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, languages of instruction differ according to school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the interests of their children are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at the moment, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
You still have to decide how many minutes you want to play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don’t need early matches to be ready,” he said.
Trump's election campaign arrives in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation voting paused for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate confirmation vote on hold for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five rallies that Trump will give next week are aimed at "dynamizing volunteers and sympathizers as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in the run-up to the campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, the latest in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows resilience to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging impulse pendulum is a totally invented sports concept but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now they’re four, so I guess we took that as a bit of a boost,” Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantage points with twelve more in play.
Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in their favour and a lot to cheer on, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
Those guttural screams grew louder as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
In getting the putt that made them win the game at 15, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he believes the American team isn’t out yet.
"You just have to focus and worry about your party," Spieth said.
It’s the only thing that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and they can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals beating Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the morning fourball hero, when he married Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first round ended up with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the ones they don’t and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after exiting the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to climb four points to the mark at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning four-balls, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but were unable to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points out of the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fitted in perfectly to defeat a dismal Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an extra 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without pity or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of 29 games in the fourball and foursomes modes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited as his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant windy day in southwest Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been twice in the history of the Ryder Cup in which a team scored four points in the individual, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to retain it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important steps to show its goodwill” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to nuclear proliferation and technology.
“However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US,” he added.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first.”
As Ri resumed North Korea's already known complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted loosening tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive eight goal, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions sharpen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim “a man rocket on a suicide mission.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that "it takes two years, three or five months anyway."
China and Russia are discussing whether the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making “mafia-like demands.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he requested were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and progress toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep longer in order to combat the growth of the male culture of studying all-night caffeine-stimulated.
One scholar found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects about how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, trainers, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficits affect athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure for students that implied lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough and have a good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid getting fat, since lack of sleep causes the brain to enter starvation mode, which makes you constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider the option of setting an alarm to lie down, as well as for when they wake up. Likewise, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an uninspired Rangers line-up never gave the feeling that he was going to tie.
While the Rangers went down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to have treated for a head injury after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overthrew Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston who scored a point for the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their organized ensemble suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's short pass of the first half sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed this great opportunity.
A powerful free-kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defenseman, Alan Lithgow, only managed to claw the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that they would have had to ask for a penalty after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head-over-heels and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose the Menga for a single over.
Gerrard acted on the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a move that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow fell from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he became entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, counter Geiger has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, sure it's popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Defective Cells
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Defective Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can “see” a protein common to several types of cancer and re-inject it.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2, and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat following his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was spotted in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
If I had been concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault lawsuits made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded images of West's criticism to social media.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to make a mockery of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They came with me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with that hat.’
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pee," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pee?", saying I would "wear my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
Their comments sparked apologetics in the audience at least twice and members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, Variety magazine reported, with the following testimony that one person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole study remained in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people puzzled with an interpretation of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR DOING FRONT OF THE MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply “being who he is and that’s completely wonderful.”
“So anyway, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“Like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the song, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a male hero, saying that such roles on the screen translate into what seems like young people often have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has failed" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where do we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields."
From November, Kit will star in a remake of True West, by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health officials said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to practically zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican Party senators, “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican Party senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and “ultra-right” commentators.
“Lies, lies and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
“This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial was done with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"He has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
It doesn’t have to be challenging.
You should not question the accuser’s motives.
He must remain calm and calm.”
It appeared that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, which critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s great,” he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department has alerted "the law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities to these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure we find out the culprits,” he continued, “as well as that they are considered legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my team members.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is now traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire about the matter of the obviously stupid that we are in the new export opportunity of the nation become?
Either way, Johnny English’s incompetent jumpy-eyed, rubber-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie theater territories.
Of course, it is the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to flattery, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr Bean chip, and a bit of that kind that contributed a single note to the Fire Cars theme at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There's a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor steps make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes into view, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these types of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as witty or concentrated as Atkinson’s silent film jokes in embodying Bean’s character.
Now the permanent topic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's network of top-secret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the serving agent, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination of a pompous and conflicting prime minister who is already suffering from a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can’t do much with the script.
His intelligence advisers inform him that as all active spies have committed, he must get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with their long-time and suffering companion Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the mistakes of Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims she can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falconry: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that brings them illegally aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Evidently, all the arrests come out of the latter sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it looks like it's taken out of a children's television show.
The result is fairly regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does his talent justice?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make Britons work four days a week but pay for five.
Supposedly, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day-a-week shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that aligns with the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At present, however, the Labour Party does not support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day workweek does not enter the party’s policy and is not being considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadows also imply the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover all their investment, since a Labour government could make “deductions” due to perceived irregularities.
It has also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
On Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"They said I was going to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done so.
He was strong, determined, and determined.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be irreversible.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive poster of stars who will act and an equally impressive mission, to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending audience had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal.
But what is the degree of success of the Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism,” people who think they make a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has logged more than 19 million “actions” from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It says these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK society of investors and executives that has pledged to "help children develop to their fullest potential", with the promise of providing Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 CiGlobal tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a "blockade" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced.
“If necessary,” Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia saying it “only has one tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was established to double the existing pipeline’s capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position gained the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Examine Her 2020 Presidential Nomination, Says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy for president following the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” he said.
"After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "taking this country by the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was blunt in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said in a tweet that "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote."
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "return different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what the militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Sessions de Grace v. American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and their children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detivérona in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s report said.
Tax officials continued to debate in the report that the policy rejecting immigrants’ entry harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide manpower.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“The circumstances are very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her feverish baby at the evacuation center of the downed city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of abuse with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referenced the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. Congressional elections, a fact China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials minted on Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the U.S., China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and U.S. businessmen.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China “is intensifying that harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the newspaper post at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He also claims that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh disaster causes women’s Republican vote to be lost within days of midterm elections
While many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were in a position to move forward with the vote.
“These things cannot be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the mood of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., daily.
On Friday morning, opponents, with the flu of “Approach November!”, manifested themselves in the Senate aisle, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectation," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“It’s already high.
But it will be even more so, especially among the undecided women voters of the neighborhoods outside or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford’s public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the defendants’ bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents fully or probably believe Ford’s testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh was attacked in a drunken state when he was 17.
In contrast, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals at a college party while she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky enough that Inrupt's hidden intention is to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data warehouse unique is that the user has complete control over who can access that information.
The company describes this as “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to its chairman John Bruce, is for the company to provide appropriate resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
A tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First World War.
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous honor in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, emphasized the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's achievement that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine-gun fire".
He was later rushed to reach the line of fire and, with "great courage", directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and knocking down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandmother's actions were "something I could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."

Imagine that you take the whole night off to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when it comes to the best part something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, with six of the main ones, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to see the faces, UK viewers were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very bad-tasting joke".
“State regulations state that that content wasn’t appropriate for 6 a.m., and that’s why it had to change to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will consider UK viewers in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change happened I started to receive a lot of messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the maximum, but we passed and
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this led him to find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he reached high school.
Guest of the first broadcast of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he started talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked the boys and girls".
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what pushed me forward and gave me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to show that he was “someone” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed to discover his sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that 20 years of difference between them has never been a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at just 14 years old he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he says.
“But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son for were a few tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t going to tell him I wouldn’t be here to take that front row,” Daley said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that he really wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of the song Proud by Heather Small is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on the tip.

A low-form Mickelson ended up in the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will break a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will need to improve his technique so that it doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed on the bench by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or Saturday's foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action, like so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where tall grass usually punish the wrong shots.
And if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faced on Sunday’s ninth game with precise British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start well, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he played today, slapped me on the shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready,” Furyk said.
“I had full confidence in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he’d play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
“He’s a funny, sarcastic person, he’s an engineer and he likes to mess with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he said.
“I’d love to see how good the younger players have been with him this week.
It’s a lot more with a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Dane made his debut in 1997 in a game at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep thinking we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won little,” Bjorn reflects in the photo, after watching the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
We have to go all out tomorrow.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This doesn’t end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I won’t tire of saying it, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory ahead of time.
Tomorrow we'll meet the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then put your ability as a golfer to the test.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last-day laps, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had brought the players together for the final day.
“We have 12 important games, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in those intermediate matches.
We prepared our lineup with this in mind and put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
Germany's New Warship Postponed Again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won’t arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be out of date when they enter service.
The disgraced F125 frigate was reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a boat to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed in the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed that it has already reached the astonishing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the initial 2200 million euros.
The problems of the younger frigates take on particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships capable of deploying.
The official states that this problem is increasing, since the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new research being carried out on a Scottish Highlands farm aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are more important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly glue traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind.
But due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, inspections of children and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even has Scotland's only and first bat reserve on the Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, claims that this is the ideal territory for them.
“At Threeave we have a large area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on the properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity ni<0xC3><0xB1>o could kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or annoy them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
“There’s still a lot to learn about bats, and in the case of many species, we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him false, claiming that the only thing he wants people to know is to make himself known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33, faked this news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times not.
What was said today is false,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“People want to be known by my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy and respectable man,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the accusations, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that both of them had sexual relations with each other.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt terrified of reprisals and was concerned about public mockery.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the deal while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to reunite with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Automakers will leave the UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need to make a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker has said that if no deal is reached, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager at Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with parts from UK and EU suppliers arriving every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could arise.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and Unite union coordinator, said his members are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I know that once these jobs go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House has said Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed by another week due to the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Russia’s aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump dismisses the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president by the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is not yet a set date, it could be this week or it could be a week late, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists have questioned that claim, as Sanders has been without a press conference since September 10.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders stated that the lack of informative sessions was not due to an aversion to the grandiloquence of reporters, although he added that it will not be she who denies this attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any sources that endorsed the data.
Sanders said: “If the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that’s a lot better than asking her questions.
You are witnessing how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences alone are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes strange appearance to the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm the mood in the face of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and communicating its desire for them to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to covering the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are scheduled to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a busy time for everyone.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the European Union and beyond, bring undisputed experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted when he reached the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a stretcher to perform a subsequent evaluation.
A Tennessee State coach informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Also, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the said injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red-shirted second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total innings on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his season total to 18.
A stamp duty will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. This extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases, could be up to 3%.
Facenda expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of new constructions in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which is driving up prices and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the estate transfer tax to help new people buy their first home.
He accused the big housebuilders of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderately priced houses to fix the “housing sector shame” that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of challenges in which the tenant is not to blame.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "last ambition" is to become the coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the northwest, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
“I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden many times with my father as a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he did not feel any concern about succeeding such consolidated figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League at this time.
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the same as that of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get there, but I probably only consider myself successful here if I can bring the club back to the Premier League."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a stint at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint at Hearts.
During this period, he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being on the verge of coming down to win the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn’t feel bad, I earned a reasonably good life and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure at work, but I like to train.
I’ve always loved training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a picture is 17:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced 2.7 percent growth during July, but restaurant consumption declined 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial advisory board, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the world of football for longer than expected caused that in July a pattern similar to that of June was shown, in which the pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, compared to their restaurants.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones that obtained the best results with increases in consumption above the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the controlled pubs and bars, beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
Time and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if this is added to the continued increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and the weather will be in charge of saying whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the much-needed respite for the sector.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The UK’s Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry’s benchmark.

A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of “Insta fake” accounts (referring to the social photo-sharing network Instagram).
This news has led to an increase in the fear that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a softened "principal" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenage girl asking to be "raped".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teenagers who are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its inclusion on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics among a total of Olympic gold medalists and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "I suffered an apoplexy a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
“Thank you for your messages of encouragement.”
An ad from a breast milk extractor comparing women to cows divides public opinion in networks
A mother’s milk company has shared public opinion on social media with an ad in which it compares nursing mothers to cows it’s milking.
To announce the launch of the world’s first “silent portable breast milk extractor”, Elvie has released an ironic music video-style announcement to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like: "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't notice, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues, "I'm moving, moving, I'm feeding the babies, moving, moving, I'm moving my friends."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this exposes the "horror" of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving birth,” he wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal subject (Elvie/mother)
Another spectator commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But if so, why aren’t they being used to advertise a milk extractor to mothers who stay with their babies?”
Another spectator added the following: “What an announcement with so little tact.”
Other viewers defended the announcement, including a woman who said the song sounded "very funny" to her.
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpreted it as a joke.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad for mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discrete extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can discreetly fit into a maternal subjector, which gives women the freedom to move around, subject their babies, and even get out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Executive Director of Mother commented: “The Elvie Extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time Elvie has occupied the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents for the children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that such data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who are godparents or who are part of their home are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to persecute these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court before a month has passed since their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to asylum workers.
Many will appear by video conference rather than in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements to receive assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts according to refugee workers and system reports published in recent months.
Lawyers said these fears increase in larger centers such as Tornillo's, in which there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is having a bad time will go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving the children to the campground without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
“They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he said.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that proper conditions were given for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "diffusion of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We are turning to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would be aimed at the jihadists, including the soldiers of the al-Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem explained the conditions for ensuring the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are expecting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
This is probably the most dramatic end of a presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have multiplied by more than two, reaching 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when major news broke.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s about something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner for ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it supposes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “anonymous” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Storfort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned bomber jacket (“a garment full of Trump’s arrogance,” according to the Washington Post.)
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that deals with the character changes and the daily plot twists of Trump’s show (the conflict with the N.F.L. Jooxi).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you’ll be left behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The foreign money comes to the masses to finance the candidacies to the House for the elections of the half of the legislature
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives serving in the race to fill the same position.
This newly reorganized Pittsburg-based district is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb stands up against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral district of the former districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign funding festival among the main financial arm of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed wide following.
That post was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, and then pushed back.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization’s management team out.
State Department officials have decided to order the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to return "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," the department's spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being imposed on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to head the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to it, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations whenever and whenever the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public file.
“Mr. Mueller is also leading his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to be accountable to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to strike a coup against Hitler if the Western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around those turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy hastens or lags behind.
Americans are facing several of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the information in The Times is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibilities from Mr. Trump?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was known to the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to fasten Shabbat candies on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to get more important things done.
“It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something positive and we got a point.
We had the chance to win in the end, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to achieve all three points, but it will be difficult, because they achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure that we will be able to fight to achieve a positive result.
“Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes I’ve made to the team, but there’s a great atmosphere right now.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget about last season and be successful.”
Women Are Worried About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this Nationwide study stated that they commented with their partners on the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a relative to take care of them, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to agree on where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you’re not able to communicate.
You should also consider signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who attend it?” asked Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”
A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to rise.
Due to the cut-off of communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's 7.5-magnitude epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Célebes province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that is located along more than 300 km of coast northwest of the island of Célebes.
This regency, an administrative region smaller than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the Central Celebes province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire with high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of peoples and caused the deaths of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regency of Aceh-based Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami on this occasion, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence offense, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone away.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on a $500 bond, KTUU said.
He was presented before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, as soon as" when asked, the prison said.
Palin faces three minor Type A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor type B felony, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that she suffers after serving with the military in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Célebes Central, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos through social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu city when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a rarely applied death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway, killing pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and that he caused them serious injuries "intentionally," according to the notification of the death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by organized crime prosecutors, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "notable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the indictment.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade ago, the Southern District of New York did not prosecute a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regrets during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in charge of representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence with no possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party claimed that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU).
UK MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK "would have already left" the EU if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces to reconcile the divided ranks of her party has been highlighted by joining the pro-EU Tories in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If I had given him the job, we would already be out of the EU at this time," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan.”
In a statement, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, since she told reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
“Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that it is necessary to make politicians “feel uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are gathered today to tell them that we will not let them leave with theirs.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilising the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU held a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group launched this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party implementation at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
“There is no such thing as Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a municipal session in a township in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of speculation that places her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the council format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to introduce himself to the president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems, and that’s what a woman in the presidency does.”
An arrest has been made in connection with the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-meter-long youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was starting from the pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the group, which would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced it after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to accidentally leave the interior at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the starting grid and climbed up to seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to the fact that he kept his tyres to get to go faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap 44 but was unable to advance any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Unsuitable body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act on Saturday over her insistence on not leaking Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people were "miserable, repugnant and liars."
“The only thing that could happen is the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Lembranse?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any filtration?
Remember your answer...did you filter the document?: "oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
We filtered it?...No.,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“I asked you to keep your confidentiality and I did what you asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during Saturday night’s act: “I tell you that body language was not the right thing to do.
It may not have leaked, but it used the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, no matter who they harm, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars noticed the loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the match back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local set before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to bounce back to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assist.
In an initial tense period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the 15:16 draw goal.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advanced on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance to Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured victory by their team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an airplane can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after dying to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The death toll is 800 and many are missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to be felt in the area and there are many people trapped under the cliffs of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower that was violently rocked.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said it was possible that this decision would save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Break our hearts when we find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman, said in a statement.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia has previously suffered earthquakes in Lombok this year in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed by the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
“That’s an extremely positive thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said both he and other passengers were able to advance between the water reaching their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site in the task of improving a pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution referred to evidence Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recount the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford climbed the platform on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He’s taken his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be seen for sentencing by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre’s negative perception by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and the fight against social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City child care worker is asking for a couple after a "racist" message
A New York City childcare provider will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother complaining that she was “another black.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her distress when she discovered that childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the caretaker who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job badly and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid the working day and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice will sue the couple for redundancy compensation and demand compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no contract in between.
“Look, I want to show you that those things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, later adding, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him a message that I didn’t intend to send him.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
Come on!
After comparing the lawsuit to an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby for two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to go after someone like that?”
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear as it could be concluded in a new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a person who first read it before it was published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, described as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although he was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad used to call regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll be back with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly being consumed and leaving his body.
He had died before and was now dying.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
“I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed your love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of distressed women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel the way I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any room.”
However, he left the job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I have a continuing concern that a side effect will occur."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day came to a close (when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact with them or anything).
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "He broke up the family.
Undress us.
We need to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited-time, limited-scope investigation), we might be able to get a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "erasing" due to supporters' shutdown.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of time.
Five weeks until the midterm elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A Senate vote will take place, currently held by 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea falls under Kim’s command
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said 1,127 defections occurred last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs levied by people in charge of crossing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the largest stretch of border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China regards defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which technically continue to be at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S.-imposed sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
“If we do not have confidence in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to go to the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved that way, I would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the sexual abuse allegations against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and being talked about while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation killing" organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he could not access the Supreme Court because it demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats get a majority in the House.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be in not just the Supreme Court, but the court you're in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh may make against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to go to court and still wait upstairs for us to say, 'Look at that well!'" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it cannot be driven out without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do you?"
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she also cried when she got angry, but who developed a technique that was that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was crying with, 'You better be thinking that I'm okay.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I started crying with an indescribable rage, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the bottom of the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an off-marriage adventure on a boat named Monkey Business and was pulled out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” I said in laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
It was called “Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because the campaign was advanced, there was a delay in fundraising, so he swore that he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of delegates and anger at the existing sexism) that ran out of words.
"You'd think she had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are they writing on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could turn out to be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, taxing half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing counterattacked in the same way each time, the most recent raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to imitate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-based researcher at the Center for New American Security, a research center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The U.N. estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat on European soil and has been without a Ryder Cup win in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battled during the tournament, sent the ball into the water in hole 16 of par 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups in play, Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t often cry, but today I can’t help it.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles match.
"It's incredible how proud I am today to have been able to beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching that kid play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend not to get off the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We're fighting.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
“We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to take out the hat.
They were superior.”
