Members of the Welsh Assembly worry that 'looks like dolls'
Some Members of the Assembly have objected to the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to laughter at the political level.
A member of the Labour Assembly said his group was concerned "that it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, "twp" means "stupid", and "pwp" means "what".
A member of the Plaid assembly said the whole group was “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" about the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
For the letter W is said to be the same as the letter U is said to be the same in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on all the names of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals that received strong support for naming the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP received the highest support during the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are obviously offering alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement could be a headache for the presidency's Elin Jones, who is expected to table draft legislation on the amendments in a few weeks' time.
Legislative acts on the scope of reforms and other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the system plan of the Committee.
During the debate on legislation, Members of the Assembly will have a decisive voice on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A global vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Contrary to the plebiscite on the change of name, the President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov said that he will ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin and other churches were ringing during Harlem’s troubles
“The old people I spoke to said that historically, a bar and a church could be found on every corner,” Adams said.
You won’t find one or the other today.”
He said he understood why the bartenders had disappeared.
“People are communicating differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people meet all the time.”
Speaking of churches, he worries that the money received from the sale of property will not be enough for long, as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back to where they started.”
He added that churches can be replaced by multi-apartments with cooperative apartments, where people will live who will not help the remaining temples.
“Most of the people who will buy cooperative apartments in these multi-apartments will be white,” he said, “and therefore will rush to the moment when the churches are completely closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by the White Congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The first congregation of white Methodists was established in the 1940s.
The nearby congregation of blacks took on the name of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a retail boycott on 125th Street, the main Harlem store that refused to hire or hire blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but because the parishioners of Father Johnson were planning to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon the bells of the poor.
Experts, who played the carillon in July, called it another way – “the treasure of culture” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionysus A. Linda. 18 years ago, he began playing the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church in the past few months has been a complex history involving architects and contractors, some of whom have been called by the Church’s laity, others by the Episcopal Church’s diocese.
Zakristia, a parish governing body made up of lay leaders, expressed concern to the diocese in July that the diocese would "effort to pass on the costs" to Zakristia, although it did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A fisherman in California has injured a 13-year-old lobster.
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
He was attacked at Ensinitas near the beach of Svyturi at 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel of San Diego KSWB-TV said he had been hanging out with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help, and then came with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hammelis told me at first that the boy was worried about getting a lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting: “I’m bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hammelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keys had been ripped off.
“I started yelling at everyone to jump out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was flown to San Diego's "Rady" Children's Hospital, where he was found to be in critical condition.
What kind of shark attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking over Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams with a multi-purpose store-style beauty department, where specialist consultants will work.
With <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow and sales figures for fashion and household goods are falling, larger beauty departments will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if they are successful, will be launched next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use the shelf, once intended for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time – Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also receive more local brands in areas similar to those in stores such as Boats.
The shopping centre is also re-launching its range of boutique make-up products, most of which are vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Sally Ooke, Birmingham.
Due to shopping online and the desire to buy in small quantities daily from the local stores of essential goods, shopping centers have to try harder to attract people to visit there.
Says Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, that branded outlet stores are increasingly looking like universal stores, as retail chain stores try to fight the selling of goods cheaper at Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's incorporated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and also set up a number of Habitat stores, as two years ago they bought both networks, which were said to have boosted food sales, and their acquisition was more profitable.
The previous attempt by the mall to renovate its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boats, but the union ended the dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from drugstores in malls.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business in 281 stores to Lloyds Pharmacy’s network owner Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
It has been argued that Lloyds’ contribution to this plan adds to an extended range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our brand range has been designed to meet every need, and due to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive beauty spot that challenges the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is 'engaged' by Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million severance package
'Dragon's Den' star Peter Jones 'involved' after TV host Holly Willoughby cut a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for their home circumference and accessories brand True.
The pair’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The head of the 37-year-old show, This Morning, announced the departure on Instagram.
Willoughby left the lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say that Jones was “grievous” when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday, a golden television girl at the headquarters of his business empire, Marlowe, in Buckinghamshire, admitted that new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million would no longer be enough time for her to “sign up.”
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and was expected to double Willoughby’s assets by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his summer homes.
The source said: “Truly has been one of Holly’s top priorities so far.
This was to be her long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave was a surprise to all of us.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
The Marlou headquarters has a full stock of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the launch of The Morning, one of the UK’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions of dollars to invest in products, starting with pillows and candles, and ending with clothes and household items, as well.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close ties with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby and Cappu founded True in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace ITV’s I’m A Celebrity host, Ant McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We had a hard time talking and then we fell in love.
He made a mockery of the media’s criticism of what some might call a “non-presidential” comment, as well as the positive response he received from the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a resounding "news leader" voice, Trump said:
“I didn’t say anything.”
He mentioned that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was held as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive an "appropriate response" from the US over North Korea's withdrawal.
He noted that the U.S. is instead continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: this was the end of missile tests, aiding in the release of hostages and the return of U.S. troops to their homes.
He defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this crowded arena, we’re going to have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
While more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, this has not been declared a national disaster – a necessary condition for providing international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clearly stated that there is no need for international aid, so it is a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Rescue the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the spot.
A spokesman for the national disaster agency Sutopo said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given Indonesia’s ongoing earthquakes, the country is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the announced warning, is likely to increase the number of lives lost.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Due to natural disasters, logistics are becoming even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok, treating victims of the earthquake, sails to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of Indonesia’s collapsed infrastructure as the center of his election campaign, and he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give peace of mind to Joko’s administration, as he will again take part in the elections in the coming years.
Yoko is also facing pressure over the continuing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority hold a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge makes a distant equaliser in the match against Chelsea <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Premier League by scoring at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
With their team behind 1-0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 metres from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He threw the ball on his left leg and hit it in the direction of the far corner.
The ball raised high above the penalty area flew to the top right corner of the net.
He eventually flew over Kepa’s jumped Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get in a position where I got the ball and players like Shaqas are always playing as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to stay as long as possible for the shot,” LiverpoolFC.com told Sturridge.
“I saw Kant coming in, I fixed the ball in one fell swoop and, not thinking too much, I just asked.”
After the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a 25-minute goal, Chelsea led 1-0 from the first goal.
During that attack, the Blues striker in the middle of the pitch, with his heel, returned the ball to Mateo Kovacici and rushed towards the side of Liverpool.
This one in the middle of the square quickly hit the wall.
Then he peacefully sent the ball between the opponents to the playing field of Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and, through Liverpool player Alisson Becker, with a left-footed shot, threw the ball into the net at the far corner.
The Liverpool team will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832.
The country’s disaster agency reported on Sunday that the death toll in Indonesia has risen from an earthquake and tsunami to 832.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference that many people had been trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the city on Friday.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was devastated by the wreckage of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The investigation into the murder began this morning when a woman’s body was found in Berkenhede, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. near Greison Miuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on anyone who has seen or heard anything in the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "As of now, the investigation phase is early, but I would like to address all those who were near John Street in Berkenhede and saw or heard anything suspicious that they would contact us.
I would also like to reach out to all, especially taxi drivers, who may have been able to capture something via video recorder and contact us as they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Berkenhed and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who know my wife came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing, as police have said they are informing their closest relatives of the victims.
Greison Miuse, a taxi driver, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one should be allowed to enter and leave the building.
He lost his promise when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told to wait for a few hours before being allowed to return home.
It was heard that a police officer explained to one person that now the entire territory is considered a crime scene.
The woman at the scene of the crime appeared to be surrounded.
She kept saying, “It’s so scary.”
At 2 p.m. two police vans stood in front of the fence on the inside and another van on the outside.
A large number of officers stood on the inside of the fence and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 of September 30.
The statues of Parliament's Cromwell are hit the last blow of the "history rewrite" dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice reminiscent of the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, for which the fanatical followers of Cromwell’s Puritans are responsible.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick’s proposal as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “During the current discussions on the relocation of the statue of Oliver Cromwell to Westminster Palace, the statue was inevitably to become a target.
Cromwell did not order and did not carry out the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
Perhaps not this Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of the ancestor Tom in the last century.
Created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, the magnificent image of Cromwell is a reflection of the 19th-century approach and a part of the historiography of a figure that many still respect.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people, perhaps more than at the end of the 19th century, Cromwell was considered a defender of parliament from outside pressure, and this, of course, was a monarchy.
Whether this is entirely accurate is disputed by historians to this day.
One is clear that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements, as the Lord’s defender, are also worth mentioning and honoring.”
A pig has killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, in the southwestern Chinese market, a pig attacked and fatally ravaged the farmer.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan had been found dead. Due to the damaged artery, he was covered in blood and lying near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Sining (Changhai Province, China) was preparing to inject swine vaccines in pigs.
He said he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province are planning to go to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found a dead relative and found the door open to a nearby pig.
He said there was a large pig in the piglet whose mouth was smeared with blood.
According to the report, the court’s expert opinion confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had ravaged the farmer.
Guiyang Evening News quotes: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who gave his name to Wu.
The footage from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up so that it would no longer attack other people, and held until police collected evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although few, however, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pressed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed until the animal was taken away by his wife.
After the pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but aggression can be triggered by the taste of blood.
“They’re just playful.
They like to sneeze, they're very curious... and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's "residues" will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring plenty of rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5 a.m., Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Euchenian Ridge (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, an extended low-pressure area begins to form on the Pacific side and moves eastwards, toward the U.S. west coast. As Rosa approaches the California peninsula on Monday as a thunderstorm, she will begin to carry heavy thunderstorms to the north, to the north.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching extended low-pressure area, will bring a wide-ranging amount of rain to the southwest in the coming days.
Instead, from 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause a dangerous sudden flood, a torrent of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to high rainfall in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, precipitation will drop from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Due to the tropical nature of the rain, a sudden flood and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
At the risk of thunderstorms, it would be a particularly bad idea to trek to the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms would cause wind and dust.
The upcoming extended low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to the southern California coast.
It is likely to receive more than 1 centimeter of precipitation, which can cause a small flow of debris, and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first wet season in the region.
Some subtropical lilies will begin to approach Arizona on a late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread across the state on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central U.S.
The temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) are almost 20 degrees different from the temperatures in St. Louis and Di Moino (Ayova).
Over the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and take up more places.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern regions, warm Octobers are expected to come with much of the 27-degree temperature prevailing.
The temperature in New York on Tuesday is expected to rise to 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern United States will be higher in the first half of October than the average annual temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched the speeches of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford in the 1990s over six television broadcasts on Thursday.
But the political deadlock continued after broadcasters interrupted regular programs over Friday's last-minute change: Arizona's senator drafted an agreement for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the tossing charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was entirely certain that Kavanaugh, who was drunk at a high school party, had grabbed her and tried to undress her.
Kavanaugh testified indignantly that he was absolutely sure it wasn’t.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast, a possible matter.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting the number of people watching TV in offices.
To be more comprehensible, it is an audience of the same size as it would have been during the knock-out football matches or Oscars.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, whose executives strongly supported Kavanaugh’s candidacy, topped out of all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million during a full-day court session.
ABC, which received 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
There was also a great deal of interest after the trial.
The main character of Friday’s drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning when protesters shouted at him as he tried to get in an elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN filmed him directly with his eyes down when he was being bathed by people.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks were discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh's candidacy for Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would investigate the candidate’s allegations over the next week, which the Democratic minority called for to investigate.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of harming the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit plan for the “Shakespeare” that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs, saying it was “total nonsense”.
Wayde Sims shot, police arrested suspect Dytheon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police picked up the glasses from the scene and found Simpson’s DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had fatally shot Wayde.
The lawyer informs that the security for his release is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Expert Service released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, with a detour to the neck.
The department assigns merit to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and the residents of the district who assisted in the investigation, after which the suspect was arrested.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district’s law enforcement for “prudentity and the enforcement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the youngster averaged 5.6 points during the game and scored 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked".
“We think about it all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts with ash in Mexico City
Ash erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano, which reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when the crater's accelerated activity and gas and ash emissions were recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The city was witnessing a lot of storms and earthquakes.
The photos on social media show a thin layer of ash-covered car windshields in Mexico’s surrounding areas, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysicists have observed that the activity of the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital increased when a 7.1-point earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano called Donu Gojo has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the annual police clashed with the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists stopping riot police was pelted with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The police used sticks to stop the fighting, which began later in the day.
Within hours, the independence group singing "Unforgettable, Unforgivable" clashed with unionist protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is blamed on Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but due to a large part of the vote, the voter turnout was low for those who did not want to secede.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations.
On Friday night, the pro-independence group set up a camp to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about Catalonia's independence prospects.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched as the parents joyfully shouted out those who could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in December last year the regional elections were torn apart by a vital and hard-won victory, the Catalan independence parties have struggled this year to keep up the momentum, when many of their most famous leaders have retreated to a voluntary retreat and are reluctant to hold a referendum or are in the process of organizing a referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old police mechanic who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Orioles Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repressions demonstrated by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry. Detained men who entered the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they re-entered their home in Londonderry by car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been shot down by a crossbow.
Menga's strike secured Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengo’s first goal from Livingston was a win-win.
Moving to the senior league, Livingston surprised the Rangers by forcing Ibrox club manager Steven Gerrard to lose his second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga's stroke proved to be very important, as in a moment Gary Holt's team matched up with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in this Premier League season and will meet the Hearts leaders next Sunday, from which they are eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers of the European League play at home with Vienna's Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended their unrivalled series of unbeaten games in the division to six, and head coach Holt has yet to feel the taste of defeat, as Kenny Miller only replaced him last month.
The chances of "Livingston" in the match with static guests
Even before scoring Holt's team due to its persistence, causing the Rangers a variety of problems, had to be in the lead for a long time.
Initially, Scott Robinson broke through and hit the gate, then Alan Lithgow failed to reach the ball passed by Craig Halkett's head, and he crashed near the gate.
The hosts, allowing the Rangers to play in the front, did not worry, because they knew that they could cause trouble for the guests by creating standard situations.
That’s exactly how the decisive blow was hammered.
The Rangers missed a free-kick and Livingston took the lead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared the ball with Menga, who staggered to earn a kick from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by the Rangers for longer, but the defense of the hosts was insurmountable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was almost out of work.
Such a steal continued in the second half, although Kelly had to work to hold back Alfredoedo Morelos's blow to the gate.
Scott Pittman's Rangers goalie Allan McGregor kicked his leg, and after another Livingston standard position, a ball sent by a Lithgow shot flew near the gate.
The transfer ball was constantly on the Livingston penalty court, but each time it was suffocated, and two requirements for a penalty – one due to Halkett’s encounter with Glenn Middleton, who had come in after the substitution court, and the other due to the ball’s hand – were not satisfied.
Analysis of the appearance of the phenomenal "Livingston"
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and result of Livingston.
All up to one they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-improving game.
The style and staff of the game has hardly changed since his return to the top league, but Holt deserves a lot of credit as he set the team on fire upon arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Capt. Halkett played brilliantly with a well-organized defense, and Menga valued Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall for not losing their guard.
Still, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although under Gerrard, they play well, but this time they lacked a lot to reach their level.
They hit a few crucial shots and only once made it through the defense of the hosts. A certain anxiety call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an Kelne was met in various ways
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a smile and a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, when it was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Leaders have argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to Turkey’s largest community outside of Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from marching in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in their country.
Different protests show the division of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others flout him and call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A cyclist died in a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, south of Deptford Road, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, punctuated by the culprit, who then escaped. The accident occurred about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Saturday’s accident.
The city police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison: Six Officers Injured During Breakup
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured during a major riot in a special security men's prison.
The incident took place at HMP Long Lartin prison in Vuster<0xC5><0xA1>yre on Sunday around 09.30 am BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officers have been called in to control this mess, which involves eight prisoners and it takes place in one prison wing.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the scene of the incident.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff have been called in.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are sure that those responsible will be handed over to the police and, possibly, will spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, riot police were called to the prison to manage a serious riot, during which some workers were thrown by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its flash floods (this can be useful for arid areas)
It’s not common for tropical depressions to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa, with its remaining energy, sinks through the desert’s southwest and causes a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will observe a sudden flood Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that as the rain approaches again on Monday, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Meteorological Service said in a statement that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or tropical depression not more than 322 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
Using the latest models of the National Hurricane Center, it is predicted that 5–10 centimeters of precipitation will occur, and in some places in Arizona’s Mogolon Rim, the amount of precipitation will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimetres in length, with some likely to drop as much as 10 centimetres.
For people who are not affected by sudden floods, the Pink Rain can be a blessing, as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these precipitations can be useful, as the southwest is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. Center for Drought Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from very severe drought, and this corresponds to the second-highest category," the weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the entire California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to a category of hurricane with a huge 137 km/h wind, is 619 kilometers south of the summit of Euchenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm faces cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with a thunderstorm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Falls that fall in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California peninsula to the northwest, Sonora is expected to be 8 to 15 centimetres, but possibly up to 25 centimetres,” the weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, and later on Tuesday morning, she will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday, late evening, through Arizona, she will move south toward Utah.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is a very high amount of rain on the California peninsula, in northwestern Sonora and in the southwest of the U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is believed that these rains will cause life-threatening flash floods, torrential rains in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsamer Norton attack. Arrested four people suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace area, at around 4 a.m. according to the BVL, Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
According to police, a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstok district.
Officials have reached out to anyone who may have any material filmed on a mobile phone about what happened.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "harassed by the slurs and anger of the Democratic Party."
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and offensive tactics,” Trump said in a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the vilification, the anger of the Democratic Party" during his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh on Thursday testified to Congress strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the court hearing on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said, “Americans saw that day how handsome, noble, and courageous Kavanaugh was.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a credible reputation for public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s candidacy, while also talking about the importance of Republican election activity in the midterm elections.
“We’ve had the most important election in our lives for five weeks.
“I’m not involved, even though I’m actually involved,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are “trying to resist and stand in the way.”
A senior assistant to the GOP leaders told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of Indonesia's earthquake, tsunami and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, many of them by massive waves crashing into the beach when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered in Palu on Friday for the city’s beach festival, when a six-metre-high wave began to ripple across the coast, causing many of them to faint and destroy everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-point earthquake.
“When the threat of a tsunami arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t break itself, it unloaded cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami was hitting the open sea at 800 km/h.
He said some people jumped into the trees to avoid a tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Pictures of the disaster agency from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was further rocked by repeated strikes.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) reported that the energy released by the particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It is reported that the tsunami may have strengthened due to the geographical location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number and damage could be greater along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Nugroho said the communications networks were "completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were moving to areas affected by the disaster.
It was said that "this can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation can be further aggravated."
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for failing to report a tsunami hitting Palu, although officials said the waves came after the warning was issued.
In the amusing content of social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building, who hastens to shout about the approaching tsunami to the people below the street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall slams into the shore, bringing down buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted electricity supplies and cut off communications networks around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the delivery of aid.
Authorities said the military had started sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still in dire need of food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision staff from Dongala traveled safely to Palu, where employees were standing in tents in the office yard, the images were accompanied by a defaced view along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even as aid groups began to take complex steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had been banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesia’s regulations, funding, provision and foreign-based staff can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still an accident at the provincial level,” Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani told reporters.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can call for international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and loved ones of the missing people expected their loved ones to become part of a miracle that will affect the dark history of natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been strangled for two days in the rubble near her mother’s body.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono has learned the names of two paragliders from the missing Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Monday, were his students.
“Because I’m older in paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon detailed how within hours of announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, the news traveled through the paragliding sports community. He sent messages hopelessly using WhatsApp app, Palu to competitors who took part in the beach festival.
However, there was only one gray, not two blue crows, in his messages.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he said.
A bank robber stole $26,750 from the Newport on the Levee Entertainment Center.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $ 26,750 from a Brink's employee who ran an ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center.
“The driver of the car was a bank robber at the entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “escaped from behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money to replenish it.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing changes to his Twitter account, he wrote: “A person formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old K. West has been called Ye for some time and named it the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
On the show, he has to replace singer Ariane Grand, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
This is not just a shortening of the current professional name – Mr West said earlier that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that means us.
It began with Kanye, who means the only one, and became simply Ye, which means the reflection of our good, of our evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced a preference for the names of Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) promises not to use soldiers against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to "never use military force to intimidate the people of Mexico" at the Tlatelolco square.
On October 2, 1968, at a time when leftist student movements were starting all over Latin America, representatives of the military forces in the square shot at a peaceful demonstration, and 300 people were killed.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has solemnly promised to support young Mexicans every month by subsidizing students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. is not an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
At the same time, China presented its plan last year to lead the way in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and expected to make another breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the U.S., as Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Artificial Intelligence Superstates: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright minds from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered green cards automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence would be established.
This month, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced an investment of about $2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the coming months, however, nothing has been done about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia, an action that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means claims to Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opponents of the nationalists say the name change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voter turnout would reach the minimum 50% needed for the referendum to take effect.
The question for the referendum was put on the ballot: "Do you support membership of NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will consider the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum held in Macedonia to change the name of the country to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled the chairs in front of the tents that boycotted the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not enter through the servants’ doors,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to others, for example, China and Russia, and participate in the integration of Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaeva said.
He said the “Yes” result would be “ensuring our future.”
According to the results of a poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research last Monday, 30 to 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required voter activity.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian television “Telma”, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be held successfully, 50 percent of voters must take part in it, plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power last May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton’s defence and profit score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton defence, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, scored a 2–0 victory.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, which seemed to be incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the square at the beginning of the attack.
Before breaking out into the open, he flew between the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players wearing green T-shirts.
He punched through one defender, before beating several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then passed the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero with one swing from the penalty area, and this right-footed shot dropped the ball to the right side of the net, beating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has a foot problem,” Pep Guardiola, the city’s president, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky to have him at that point.”
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues get ahead in these Premier League games.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
At the time of the attack, Aguero received the ball while in the depths of Brighton Park.
Along the left edge of the square between the two opponents, he beautifully handed the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane slid the ball forward in a few turns as Sterling pushed toward the further crease.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the gate just before ejecting from the outside of the court.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., City will meet Hoffenheim Champions League group matches at the Zinsheim Arena Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzeris wants to play a friendly match with the "Rockies"
After the Nationals dropped out of the relegation competition, there were no more serious reasons to push back.
Scherrer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies competitively, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the knockout stages; they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5:2 on Friday night, have at least secured the chance to get a preferential path, but will still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first division.
“While we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to escape to the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and another team will gather, will probably be at the highest level that we will be able to reach this year.
Why don't you come over?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting lineup for Sunday's match, but they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer in this case.
Scherzeir, who will be 34 at the stadium for this match, has completed a shooting training on Thursday and will take the position of a mechanic on his usual rest day – Sunday.
Washington right-handed this season statistics: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 cars over 220 2/3 of the back.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican voter activity in the midterm elections, the president indirectly recalls the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be put on the scales in November.
There are five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
“It’s very important, I’m not running ... but I’m actually running, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see how it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry.
They don’t care what they’ve hurt, what they’ve gone through to gain power and control; that’s what they really want – power and control – but we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “oppose and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen it the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, ugly, low-key, and wrong people.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused a huge cheer for the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you lost the document?
Well, um, how.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one — it was really a bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for distrust of me, I wondered if I should have been surprised.
Finally, I am the latest of the Labour MPs who have been told that I am unwanted – and this is for my opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed by criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want to see a large number of members involved in the meetings and make the meetings productive."
For most of those eight years when I was a local Labour MP, Friday night’s GC meetings were exactly like that.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not at all the same and the promises of a “softer, more pleasant” policy have long been forgotten, even if they were ever implemented at all.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated by the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues, who I thought were similar in political views, began to expect me to turn around a 180-degree angle and hold opinions I would never agree with – either on national security or on the EU’s own.
Whenever I speak in public – and no matter what – there is a tirade of insults on social media that incites my withdrawal, condemns the centre’s policy and says that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am far more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I have been directed at are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with every procedure of "distrust" or change in the electoral system, this party is getting smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump out, not to speak so loudly, and then "everything will be fine" with me.
But that’s not what I came into politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which, in the true sense of the word, has ruined my entire school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who are most in need of it, whether in office or in office.
I have never hidden my policies, including the recent elections.
No one at Nottingham East should have been surprised in any way by my political opinions and disagreements with the current leaders.
To those who encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really one message I have for my constituents, the Labour Party members (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political expediency will keep me from acting on my own convictions and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 Unbeatable Ayr conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts have somewhat distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned this moment of triumph in the impressive, promising matches of the Tennent's Premiership day.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one unbeaten.
In the end, the victory brought them impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We’ve lifted all the tests in all the matches that have taken place so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m really happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr has turned out well, the players have taken advantage of their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to pick up the number, while Baghdey won with Baghdey.
Climo increased Ayr’s advantage by fines when he scored points in the middle of the race and successfully finished the personal test, helping Ayr to break free with a 17:5 score before the break.
However, Melrose's second lift started off well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was halted for a longer period of time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was taken off the bench on stretchers. The extended match Ayr continued to push forward when Stafford McDowall's attempt to successfully complete Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the players' surpluses, but Bruce Colvine's attempt after fierce pressure was unsuccessful.
The home team player returned, however, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the penalty line behind the continuing Ayr goal.
Climo successfully completed his test, as he had done almost since the start of the game update, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong’s swing at the corner of the pitch and prevented the striker Gregor Henry from staging a fifth home team attempt to earn points.
"Still Game" star seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears poised to move into the housing and food services sector after it turns out he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writing and starring alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Kraiglang.
Officially, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, though Scottish Sun sources suggested Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow’s “floating restaurant business.”
'We belong to the sea': Bolivia jailed on land hopes court will reopen way to ocean
Sailors patrol at the naval headquarters of La Passe.
The blue flag of the ocean floats on public buildings.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is decorated with the slogan: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, there are still vivid memories of the access to the ocean that Chile had to sacrifice in the 19th century in the conflict over resources, alive and longing to be brought back to the Pacific.
The hopes of the past decades have now been greatly strengthened, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia is a focused spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will be watching the announcement of the ICC decision on the big screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian Indian president who is facing a controversial election battle over re-election, is also very interested in the outcome of Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to the possibility of returning to the Pacific again,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts tend to think that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favour – even if it did, little would change.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to restrict Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICTY decision will be published only six months after the last arguments were heard hardly shows that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile’s expert on international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to pull something off, the last four years could have pushed it back.
“This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s goodwill have been destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will extend the conversation at some point, but after all this it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court’s decision was made unusually quickly.
“On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end the 139-year-long disagreements aimed at mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The solution is to see that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never give up its first nuclear weapons if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which the leaders of the rival countries agreed to during the meeting in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be planning to reinvigorate entrenched nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the “utopian dream” is that if sanctions continue and the U.S. abandons the declaration on the end of the Korean War, North Korea could ever be crippled.
Washington avoids agreeing to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take convincing disarmament action.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously not going to give up an arsenal that the country seems to see as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will quickly conquer the nearest fashionable stores.
If you want to complement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headwear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and he simply stunned Paris Fashion Week viewers with his style.
These particularly impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching creations on the podium.
Valentin’s distinctive work was a huge body-coloured hat, decorated with a wide, feather-like edge that captivated the dummy’s head.
Other accessories of a non-standard size were gemstone-cut watermelons, a witch’s hat, and even pineapple – but they weren’t designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks at the same time to Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn with lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a member's suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cube.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, don’t ask.
Styling experts predict that these huge coatings can enter the stores.
Huge hats were popular with La Bomba high-heeled hats, gray hats with two-foot edges were already worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge creation on the podium – a gray beach bag, almost the same size as the mannequin wearing it in a bathing suit.
The red brick raffle bag, decorated with raffles and a white leather handle, became an exclusive highlight of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think that next summer, huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores, because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories.”
John Edwards: “Speech is an essential skill for the citizens of the world”
Scotland’s independent schools have improved academic achievement records, failing to deliver in 2018, and have once again demonstrated exceptional exam results that have only been further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music, and other communities from across the nation.
With more than 30,000 students in total across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can design and implement a school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are willingly chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you can speak to a man in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to knit relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year’s final exams, we can say that languages are at the top of popularity and have the best retention ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A-rating.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72% of students received the highest grade of A during the Mandarin language exam, the highest grade of A received 72% of the German language learners, as well as the highest grade of A received by 69% of the students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign language teaching to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an elective subject, are now considered as important as the major subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that, for all the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill jobs, 17 percent lacked language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory for young people to be ready for their future careers.
As employment opportunities will be highly dependent on languages in the future, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses when paying for a second language, in the future he will be far superior to others if he has the skills needed throughout his life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who learns several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 per cent.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By paying for several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different in the languages they are taught.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK, looking to the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests may be, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and professionals in the field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to live in the future.
There is no denying that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, which is why it is necessary to reflect this in the education system as well.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and results to young people in Scotland.
This needs to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
There is little left for fans to see as LeBron James kicks off the Los Angeles Lakers season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing Sunday's opening game with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes to play, is not yet clear.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any more pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Short speech in West Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five planned Trump speeches next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming the suspension procedure for his chosen Supreme Court nominee, Trump is seeking to rally support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans face the threat of losing control of Congress in November.
A few hours later, Trump’s speech will take place in West Virginia, and how to watch it online?
Trump's speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the following YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to touch on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s topic this week as she has sown a lot of tension over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior when the Senate voted to suspend the candidate until a week before the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
Trump's campaign said the goal of the five meetings next week was to "energize the volunteers and supporters who are trying to protect and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congressional control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as a very hot campaign season begins," a Trump campaign spokesman said, not wanting to reveal his name.
"The language planned for tonight's Wesbanco arena in Willings should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media," Metro News said in a statement.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to polls is at the bottom of the rankings.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come in to push him to the top of the rankings,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: U.S. team determined to go militarily and expect to enter Sunday's unit competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the fourth could be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation of success is completely contrived, but the players really believe in it, especially in competitions like these.
So whose side is the success now?
"They've led by six points, and now by four, so I guess we can consider it a bit of a success," Jordan Spieth said as he prepared for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, has a four-point lead and is still waiting for twelve matches.
The enthusiasm of the Americans, according to Spieth, has faded, and they do not lack it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from the beginning to the end and unquestionably led the way.
The round-ending wild-cards of the victory were still popular, with Thomas scoring two points out of two possible points in order to finish fourth in a draw.
His stroke, which won them a victory in this match at the 15th pit, was accompanied by similar slogans, which seemed to say that the end of the American team is not yet over.
“You just have to focus and take care of your game,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players is left to play separately.
By the end of the course, there were 18 holes.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couple from Europe collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only pair to not only need extra hits on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
That course of events and the reaction of the shimmering spectators only confirm that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of the rising sun, will be able to swim through the Le Golf National.
It would be nice to have both of them at the same time in different locations.
It is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero, when he was married to Alex Noren.
An extra punch and two doubles extra punches during the first nine holes series pushed the Spaniard and the Swedes into trouble, from which they could not get away.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and a quarter of a match are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs, because of the advice they give and do not give, and because the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so decidedly came to the final first, but this fourth stage also showed that the U.S. team has a fighter backbone, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
The last day of the Ryder Cup leads Europe 10:6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a heavy overtime, after Saturday's fourth stage, ahead of the United States with a score of 10:6.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to heat up the atmosphere by winning two victories against the struggling Tiger Woods and taking the lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to save the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated tomorrow's quarterfinals against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage with a score of 3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarterfinals when it won two matches, but failed to beat the points lead
Jim Fury's side need eight points from Sunday's 12-point game to keep the trophy in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row when he and Molinari doubled down on Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup matches.
Beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fours, they unmistakably shattered the confidence of Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who did not quite beat two Saturday matches, sometimes showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his matches in fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning quarters and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the quarters; they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the first and third places in the world rankings with a score of 2:1.
Despite having a pleasant, mildly windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe didn’t go all out like butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas lifted the American cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they won a difficult 2–1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, while in the fourth match they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3, without putting the ball in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team managed to win a four-point lead in single matches, although the Furyk side would have had enough equals to retain the trophies.
Although two days were in second place, on Sunday the success from them seems to have turned around.
North Korea says it will not arm itself unilaterally if it can't be trusted
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test base, and committing not to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not received a response from the United States,” he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally arm ourselves."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s already-heard complaints about Washington’s opposition to the phased approach to nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea would be compensated in stages for its actions, his statement stood out in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament as a form of disarmament.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “the disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. demands nuclear disarmament first and is increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by means of coercive methods, even by renouncing the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“To think that sanctions can knock us out is the same as giving birth to utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If the other country was South Korea on the issue of nuclear disarmament, not the United States, the issue of the Korean Peninsula nuclear disarmament would not have taken such an action."
However, Ri’s tone of speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile master” preparing a suicide mission, directing a North Korean missile into the United States was completely impossible.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, rallied to Kim for the courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea’s claim to maturity.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no timetable for that, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have said that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the actions it has taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be resolutely continued without any rebates until the full and definitive evidence-based nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the back of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to clear the ground for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that all the progress was only for North Korea to announce after a few hours that he had made “gangster demands.”
North Korea, during a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Kim said the “appropriate measures” he sought were security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more in order to combat the growing macho culture in studies, by consuming caffeine and not sleeping at night.
One academic found that at the best university in the world, students often don’t even have a basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham City, a specialist in women's hospitals, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in the last year of my studies?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important habits of quality sleep help to achieve academic and sports results, improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Department of Health Services, said the university decided to offer this course when it turned out that students were very sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course covers a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a photo of the dorm room, where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, trainers and books and thus learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects the results of sports and what is the importance of walking to sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A student town map with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we think they have a right to know – just like you have a right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” explained Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride not to sleep at night, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of lack of sleep.
“Ensuring that you get enough and quality sleep should be the student’s secret weapon in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even while avoiding weight gain because lack of sleep switches the brain to starvation mode, so students are constantly feeling hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare a course when he attended one of his subjects at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to apply for a course available to the entire student campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-cycle students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to set an alarm clock when it’s time to go to sleep, just like the one that wakes up, and to guard against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light-emitting diodes because they can knock your circadian rhythm out of balance.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's score upset Gerardo's men
The Rangers suffered yet another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingstone managed to beat the weakened Steven Gerrard 1-0.
Ibrox expected to win their first victory in a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in an 18-game lead and now the latter's team is already eight points behind the far-flung Premier League side.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers didn't see a chance to equalize the score.
The Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, Livingston have moved up to third and are only one inning behind Hibernian.
And the Rangers’ worries don’t end there, because most likely the tribune butter hit the side judge Calum Spencus in the head and injured him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to overtake Ayr and lead him to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same monk who took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations would have upset opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers dominated by controlling the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They were able to score as early as the second minute when Menga hit the ball to Scott Pittman, who was swinging at Allan McGregor's gate, but safety ruined his chance by turning the ball away from the gate.
After a distant free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his pairing defender Alan Lithgows asked for the pass.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was all about hope, not faith in their game.
The remaining fifteen minutes Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a fine when faced with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson lost his hand in the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly intimidated by Lassana Coulibaly’s blow to the head or the gentle grin of Ovie Ejaria.
While the 34-minute score may not have matched the course of the match, no one will argue that they deserved it just for the effort.
The Rangers once again failed to beat Jacobs' tight defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his name and handed it over to Menga for easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately paid off when the safety of the land played out for Morelos, but Kelly’s impressive run-out took the hit.
"Livingston brought guests into the game they loved, with long-distance transfers of Lithgowo and Halkett's ball.
Holt's team was able to increase their lead in the end, but McGregor defended against Jacobs after Lithgow's corner.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton, who left the pitch at the end of the game, appealed again for a penalty after facing Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years and MORE... On that day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. An invention that later led to the development of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a worldwide hit in science, and later a popular cultural hit, when the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starred cowboys not particularly reminiscent of scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear how the atoms work, touch the radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Hey, it’s really shooting now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to See Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to See Bad Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells as Part of Treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
Then the cells can “see” the proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer, and are injected back again.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins characteristic of HER2-type cancers, and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung, and rectum,” explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to settle into cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia.

After the indiscreet performance at the Saturday Night Live studio, viewers were ashamed of Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, after performing the third song of Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription “Make America Great”, he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed support for Trump.
“How many times have I had to talk to white people and they said, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism were to bother me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he explained.
The SNL show began with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon joked about Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make out with West on this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had discomfort in the back of his head cover.
“They’re fooling me behind my back.
He said not to go in there with a hat like that.
They're making fun of me!
They said I reached the bottom,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I give you my Superman hat and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love.”
His remarks were at least twice provoked by dissenting slogans in the audience, and members of the SNL broadcast seemed embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One person told the media: “The whole studio was in deadly silence.”
West was called in to replace singer Ariane Grande as her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West stunned many with his performance of the song "I Love It", wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from the conservative TPUSA group leader Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits for a man: THANK YOU FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF MINIS."
But conversation show host Karen Hunter posted on her Twitter account that West was simply “selfish and that’s incredibly amazing.”
“But I choose NOT to be a human being (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’), whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator to change his name, but went down the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper Snoop Dog was originally named Snoop Lion; music legend Prince changed his name to the character and later became known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder with a knife at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter after being stabbed to death in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Next Next post: War of the Sexes star Other Harington criticizes a distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington famous as a swordsman was John Snau in the HBO fantasy adventure series about the Middle Ages, The Hundred Wars.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the macho hero. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Other said he thought “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to tackle the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old co-star of the Hundred Years' War, admitted that the topic was "strongly affecting" him.
“I feel that this topic is very important to me now. Where did we make the mistake of educating masculinity?” he asked.
"What do we teach growing men to deal with such problems?"
Another believes that, partly because of this distorted maleness, the waves could be responsible television, because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is being taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they should be characterized by this type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time – how can we change that?
“I think we made a mistake with the kids.”
He also confirmed in an interview that he would not participate in any pre-history or sequels when the series ends next summer, saying that "he already has enough battlefields and horses."
From November, Next will film Sam Shepard's True West in a modern version. It is a film about a film director and his brother a thief.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in the making of The Wars of the Roses, where he met his wife Rose.
“In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Igrita, the object of the love of the Other character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family-owned property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of the disease by 14%
China reports a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, the infection has infected more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But so the number of people infected with HIV dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said during a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time with HIV infection and AIDS, the number of people living in China has increased to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized back in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up leading women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as one of the ways to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked Republican senator’s data, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat has claimed the allegations were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
“False, false, and yet again a vile lie,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrino Hatcho, both from Utah, were also reported to have their home addresses and phone numbers.
The information appeared online on Thursday, announced by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at a time when allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were being investigated by the Senate.
The leaked information came a little later when these three senators put questions to Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information to a Waters staff member,” the statement said.
“These unsubstantiated suspicions are completely untrue and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated suspicions are completely untrue and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-esteem to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not doubt the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is campaigning in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also said his thoughts on Twitter.
“Truth, if not a lie,” he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the organizers are clear,” she continued, “that they are legally responsible for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone without exception to my staff.”
A review of the comedy “John English Strikes Again” – a spooky spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to search for Brexit hints in any British film. The same can be said about the revival of the action spy comedy franchise “John English” – “John English” was started in 2003 and the film “Ingli” was re-released in 2011.
Will this sarcastic self-pity about how clearly we have grown become a new opportunity for national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent John English has a second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with wide eyes and a rubbery face <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> the name itself clearly shows that this work of comedy is intended for non-English-speaking cinematographic regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, although he claims to be a luxury, has acquired a little bit of the characteristics of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Byne's features and a bit of resemblance to that guy, hints at what was used in the "drama of the 2012 London Olympics".
He is also somewhat grounded in the character of the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In this latest film by John English, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when John English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor slammed into his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems outspoken and strangely superfluous, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible boldly incorporate elements of comedy.
Humor is more about children than adults, and the adventures of John English I didn’t believe in don’t seem as inventive and witty as Atkinson’s silent jokes about Mr. Byne.
At the moment, the most common theme is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cybercriminal has successfully infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and exposed the identities of all British spies in the area, prompting outrage from the agent – Kevin Eldon’s overly insignificant role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's pompous and cornered character's cup, which already suffers from the crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Theresa May's portrayal of the character squeezes out everything she can, but in the script there's not much good material for it.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you will have to turn to John Inglis himself, who is currently working as a school principal in some fancy institution, but who is giving illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were a few good jokes when Inglis offered the School of Rock type academy.
An Englishman is sent back to Whitehall to discuss a state of emergency and there he meets his longtime common Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man related to the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, a high-ranking girl, the talent seems underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, able to stir up all things in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko, a fatal beauty played by Ophelia Buletova.
The Prime Minister has been dangerously shaken by a charismatic billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problem, the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, wreak havoc on a luxury Volta yacht, and English begins complete anarchy, trying to take advantage of virtual reality headsets to get to know the interior of Volta's home.
All the stunts were clearly sticking to this last series, but no matter how nice or wild it is, it all looks a lot like children's television.
Pretty mediocre.
As with the other films by John English, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly worthy of his talent?
Labour denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants company executives to share the savings accumulated due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving its workers one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and together bring home a salary of the same size.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to steer the country’s development in a favorable direction for workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source, The Sunday Times, said: “The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign was also promised by the Green Party.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said: "Four working days a week is not party politics and is not being considered in the party."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnellis took the opportunity at last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnellis said he was determined to reclaim power from the “immaculate dictators” and “profit hunters” in utility companies.
Such shadow chancellor plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover all of their share, because, having seen the blow made, the Labour government can make some deductions.
He also approved plans to include employees on the company’s board and to create included equity funds to transfer 10 percent of private sector corporate capital to employees, and they could receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer '60 Minutes' question as to whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote for at least a week on whether to refer him to the Supreme Court, so the question arises as to whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of some Republican senators in a way that would prevent them from exercising this right.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out anything that would change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to be more liberal than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course," replied Kennedy.
“As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these accusations appeared, I called him and asked, "Did you do this?"
He responded decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
So Mr Graham's opinion would not seem to change anything.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, we need really shocking accusations,” he says.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know who was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one can confirm what she’s saying.
36 years have passed.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed to poverty alleviation?
This Saturday, the World Citizens Festival will take place in New York, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the World Citizen Festival will meet tens of thousands of people in the Great Plains of Central Park who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the word more widely about the true purpose of the event – to eliminate the scourge of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the World Anti-Poverty Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a variety of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise making a meaningful effort to inform them.
But do the world’s citizens succeed in achieving this goal? 12 years remain until the deadline.
Will the idea of compensating people with a free concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called clichéd, fictitious activism – people think that it will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters, which promote the implementation of a wide variety of goals.
They argue that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policies that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and statements that were triggered by the group’s actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that almost 649 million people around the world are already directly affected by the funds provided.
The Power of Nutrition is a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom that aims to “help children grow up and discover their full potential.” With more than 4,700 global citizens facing the challenge of becoming a global citizen, Twitter is no longer the answer.
“With the support of the UK government, supporters, governments of countries and such as you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve that social injustice such as nutritional insufficiency becomes a past,” said Ambassador Tracey Ullman of the Power of Thought, speaking at a 2018 London audience.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 requests to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Nutrition Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website, which asks “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The world’s citizens answer: “It’s a long and difficult road – sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win, because we are all stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performers taking part in this year’s event in New York. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary Says U.S. Could Use Navy Blockades to Disrupt Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary, Washington can use the Navy to disrupt Russia’s energy access to markets as well as Middle East markets,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke says Russia’s participation in Syria, especially when it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
“The United States can do this by using a fleet, can make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, can block, make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke told attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He then compared Washington’s methods to those used in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser balance that would replace fuel,” he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared to the Trump administration on a mission to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, offering European consumers a much cheaper option.
That’s why Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of a flawed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump says has left Berlin in Moscow’s hands.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington’s fierce opposition to this project is purely economic, an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was met with hostile reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I certainly don’t agree with the interference of a third country in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president in the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holjok Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington to deal with our fallen government, and they have to go to the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election."
During a meeting at the town hall, Warren beat President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very scared about how Donald Trump is treating our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "there is no doubt that an FBI investigation must be carried out before the vote."
But a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own state voters believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters say the senator should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll found that former Gov. Deval Patrick has more support, with 38 per cent backing his candidacy and 48 per cent opposing it.
Other names discussed for the Democratic nominees in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says the official decision will be made in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at Donald Trump's rally about Track Palin's postpartum disorder
Track Palin, 26, who joined the military in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, following a domestic violence incident, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is going through, what he’s going through going back into everyday life, so I understand other families who are feeling the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, and some of the injuries our soldiers are going back with,” she told the crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tal.
Palin called his arrest an avoidable truth. She said that his son and other war veterans “are coming back with a little change, they are coming back with a stronger heart, they are coming back with doubts about whether they will get respect for what their fellow soldiers and countrymen are, and everyone else is.”
He was arrested Monday in Vasily, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as charges of reporting domestic violence with a gun and being indiscriminate, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasily's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support resistance to the new asylum-seekers policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, D.C., 18 states and the district’s representatives submitted comments to amicus curiae (court counsel) in support of the asylum-seekers’ policy challenge, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" were raping her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace-backed state lawyers have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many asylum applications as states grappling with the ongoing problems of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeals Board’s 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was “unrecognizable by decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be made in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and with such a ban this principle is violated,” the amicus curiae notes.
In this comment, lawyers also argue that immigration policy is detrimental to the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to engage in business and “provide the necessary employment services.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and the victims of gang violence.
“Refugees are granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The aim of the granted asylum has never been to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day all over the world.
With the death toll from Palu rising twice, the search for the remaining survivors is desperate.
The situation of the rest of the population is constantly deteriorating.
"The tension is very high," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her baby's feverish son who was knocked down in Palu city's evacuation center.
“Fast people don’t stop transporting more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
It has been observed that the inhabitants return to their ruined houses, collect water-soaked items, try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5-point earthquake hospitals have been damaged.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the back and shoulder, lie outside the Palu Army Hospital – patients of the hospital are being treated outdoors for severe repeated blows.
His eyes light up with tears as he recounts how, in the fifth floor room of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter, he felt a severe earthquake.
“There was no time to save others.
I seem to have broken through the ruins of the wall,” Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope she's healthy."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of fearing propaganda
A week later, when an official Chinese newspaper circulated a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, citing the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid-for addition to Iowa’s most popular newspaper, Des Moines Register, and accused China of influencing U.S. congressional elections on November 6. China denies such an accusation.
"Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in a growing Washington campaign aimed at putting pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war, and both countries are plunging into tariffs on each other’s imports.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China’s retaliatory tariffs were imposed on exporters from Iowa and similar states who backed the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a long-time governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad said China was "increasingly bullish about printing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s respect for freedom of speech and the press and ordered a paid advertising message to the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In the meantime, you won’t find opposing voices in the local Beijing press booth, and you won’t create a real picture that reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the hardline of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
Branstad also added that "one of China's best-known newspapers has deviated from its offer to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: mid-term elections, Kavanaugh’s fiasco deters Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been charged with several counts of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this will receive a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions are particularly strong, and many Republicans are already officially saying they want to hold a vote.
Such things cannot be taken away later," said University of Syracuse School Professor Grant Reeheris in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last-minute calls to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it tomorrow and November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for MoveOn, a progressive think tank.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate foyer, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the KZIP reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will spill over,” said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is impartial to the news site.
People say she was strong, and they’re right.
But it could strengthen positions even more, especially among the undecided women voters in the suburbs and younger 18-29-year-old voters who, although they don’t like the president, often just don’t vote.”
Even ahead of Ford’s public testimony, when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment of a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans approved of the candidacy, it could lead to outrage.
“This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee or the final vote, it’s not just about whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, it’s about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Mr. Ford,” said Guy Cecil, a Democrat who is running for president.
Still, it seems that Americans still don’t agree on what to believe after the testimony of Kavanaugh and Ford, although it gets a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or probably believe in Mr. Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they fully or most likely believe Mr. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was indeed or likely to be lying about the evidence, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At the urging of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and the testimony of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh had assaulted her when she was 17 years old, indiscriminately.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her her genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University’s 9th district.
The inventor of the web plans to create a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is developing a new startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor "Inrupt" is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee open source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to what information has access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to take over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the starter.
This is a historic moment.”
A solid-technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides what and to what information can be accessed.
The company calls this the authorization of the person through the data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, an IBM-bought security platform, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team disagreed with Facebook or Google over changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Medium report published on Saturday, Berners-Lee said Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet at the Massachusetts University of Technology into a Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential say in debates about net neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Honored Bernard Baths – a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth, the only clergyman of the Church of England was honored in his native town, who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Lt. Col. Bernard Baths won the award during the September 29, 1918, Belengliz-Lukkura attack.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he did not know that he had been awarded a top-level British army award.
During the parade in Ra<0xC5><0xA1>dene, Northamptonshire, the memorial stone was discovered by two grandchildren.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone just 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat was “wonderfully symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kenten Canal "difference to very heavy smoke, and a heavy blow to the bonfires and automatics."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and "especially powerfully" led the line forward, and then himself attacked the gunman and killed three of the group's fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vannes, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “someone, to whom he himself will never equal, but at the same time humility is an extremely inspiring thing.”
After the parade, led by Brentwood's Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Baths placed the crown.
Micheal Vannas said it was a great honor for him to attend the parade, adding: "The real hero's member is shown by the support that many people will give."
MMA enthusiasts did not sleep all night to see the Bellator 206, but had to satisfy the Pig Pepa
Imagine: you don’t go to sleep all night to see the phrase “Bellator 206”, but you don’t get to see the main sight.
There were 13 fights in the San Jose poster, six of which were on the main card and broadcast live in the UK overnight on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while preparing for battle between Gegard Moussas and Rory MacDonald, UK viewers were stunned by the cut-off of the film Pig Pepa.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was for this fight that he did not sleep until dawn.
On Twitter, one of the patients called the change of the broadcast to a children's animated film "a kind of sick joke."
“According to the rules set by the authorities, at 6 a.m., such content was not appropriate, so it was necessary to turn on the children’s program,” Bellator Chief Marketing and Communications Vice President Dave Schwartz said in a statement.
“Yes, the chicken poop.”
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said the company would seek to adjust its schedules in the future to match viewers in the UK.
“When I think about repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it,” Coker said.
“But at that time there is 6 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to solve it until Sunday at our own time – Monday at their own time.
However, we are already working on this issue.
Believe me, after the change of the broadcast, exchanged a lot of messages, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it is a question of power.
I can promise it won’t happen next time.
We wanted to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the passionate, but simply failed.
This is a failed situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt underweight due to his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to pursue success.
The athlete said only in elementary school he realized that he was not the same as everyone else.
For the first time, on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, he said he took to public speaking about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a father, it was not so important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of this long-running show, has been out of work for several months.
In the first show hosted by Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley said growing up feeling inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, that sense of weakness and otherness has been an incentive that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself worthy of this, so that he would not disappoint those around him when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and, taking part in this year’s British Commonwealth Games, has taken the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he took the opportunity to speak publicly about it because he believed he was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others that hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — was unexpected.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to Delay, when so many survive at such a young age – he was only 14 in his first Olympics, and after three years his father died of cancer – it is difficult to meet someone who is the same age, but experienced the same height and lowness.
In June, the couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Blacko-Daley, T. Daley's perspective, according to him, completely changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said that winning a gold medal was the most important thing for me,” he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"Rob is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son’s name is the same as that of his grandfather Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley's father did not want to settle for death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he intended to watch as he sat in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be able to live long enough to sit in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” Daley said.
A year later, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that I’d been dreaming about it my whole life – to jump into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the choice of the first song for the show – Heather Small’s work “Proud”, which reflected his feelings in the preparation of the Olympics and still pleasantly frightens the skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m.
Lost form Ph. Mickelson spent Saturday's Ryder Cup tournament on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday for 47 appearances in the Ryder Cup, but he will need to improve his form to make sure it doesn’t turn out to be a failure.
Ph. Mickelson, who now plays for the 12th time every two years, was put on the bench by captain Jim Fury in Saturday's quarterfinals.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day on the support team, while the rest improved their technique on the pitch in order to correct annoying mistakes.
Even at the height of his career without striking very straight, the 48-year-old is not an ideal player in the tight Le Gold National courts, whose long stretch of rough grass is extremely unfavourable to inadvertent blows.
Also, as if the pitch itself wasn’t scary enough, in the ninth match that will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson plays against the highly-accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the four-point-rear Americans succeed in getting the next 12 units of the match off to a good start, Ph. Mickelson’s sword can become absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player, but probably could not speak otherwise.
“He understood the role he played today, patted me on the back and said with a hug that he was ready to play tomorrow,” Fury said.
He doesn’t lack confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes in both the past and this week has given a lot to these teams.
I had no idea he was going to play two matches.
I imagined more, but it went like this, so we decided that we would do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo’s record and become the most-played athlete in Ryder Cup matches.
It may be that this marks the end of his Ryder Cup career, and not equal to the heights of his personal records.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Fury says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to laugh at people, and he’s a great guy to be in the team room with,” he explained.
“I think it was fun for younger players to compete with him this week, it was good to watch.
It’s a lot more than a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a heavy reload can quickly pass
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big rematch in the final race of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderama, where captain Seve Ballesteros led the opposing team to a five-point lead against the Americans, but crossed the finish line just before leading with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We keep reminding ourselves that we had a big overhaul in Valderama; we had a big overhaul in Bruxelles, where we lost, and also in Valderama, where we won, but just barely,” Bjorn said (in the photo), observing the 2018 edition’s victory in the result of 5:3 in the Gulf and the National on Friday.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
You will need all the strength tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to consistently pursue it.
I’ve always said I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players’ performance on a difficult pitch, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to run out of sight in any way.
Tomorrow is going to be a completely different day.
Tomorrow will be an individual game – that’s something else.
It’s great to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, your ability to play golf is tested to the limit.
This idea needs to be implemented by the players – tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now he will have to separate with his partner, and he will also have to squeeze everything out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Fury expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself suffered both sides of the last day's surprises, as he was in the winning team in Brussels until Europe performed the miracle of the Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the final day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but aim for a quick start – the one you saw in Brussels and Medina.
When the acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle battles become very tense.
We formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will be tasked with trying to lead a responsible fight and clash with Rory McIlroy's top-tier macho, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading the Europeans.
“I chose these guys in this order, because I think they will successfully beat the whole game,” Bjorn said of his selection for the unit games.
The delivery of the new German warship has been postponed again
The latest German navy frigate was due to start operations in 2014 and replace Cold War war-era warships, but local media say it won’t see them until at least next year due to increasingly destructive systems and a steep price hike.
According to an army spokesman quoted by Die Zeit newspaper, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate ship, has now been put into service until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was overshadowed by the problems the ship had already presented.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful submachine gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and certain stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which allow the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, because of the endless delays in advanced technologies, military vessels that are said to allow Germany to divert military power to overseas territories, are too old to use them.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions a number of major software and technical defects that would have left the ship unattended in a military mission.
The software’s shortcomings are particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that this ship is much too heavy – this reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the navy to implement various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project – in addition to perishable technical equipment, including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest problems with the frigate have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy was in fact "lacking ships to use".
The official said that within a certain period of time the problems arose because the old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
"National Trust" listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in a Scottish high-altitude manor, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor dwarfs, soprano bats, brown ears and aquatic bats in the gardens of Vester Roso Inverevo.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be placed, allowing to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with hand-held detectors.
The analysis of all audio recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the signals emitted by bats and one or another type of activity.
Then a map and a report of residential areas will be created to help form a detailed picture of the behavior of the whole landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Nature Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitat is most important for bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat maintenance work, such as grassland development, as well as identify the best way to care for forested areas to make them suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined.
They are threatened by works of construction and development of real estate, affecting slums and destroying residential areas.
Wind turbines and lightning, as well as flycatchers, are also threatened, as are some chemical agents used to treat building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, catching prey during night hunting is more helpful for the ears than the eyes.
Bats accurately determine the location of obstacles in the trajectory of insects or flight by means of a man-made echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, is looking at bats in a very responsible way.
There are ten trained experts working here who regularly conduct investigations, break checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only bat-specific reserve in Damfris and Threave Manor in Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Manor supervisor David Thompson says the estate’s territory is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats in the Treave yard,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is essential to check for bats before the start of the site surveillance work, as up to 400 females and juveniles can be killed by the accidental destruction of one frog, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and prohibited from being killed, harassed or disturbed, as well as prohibited from destroying their trowels.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Protection Foundation, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t even know how many local species are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects accusations of rape – lawyers intend to sue the German newspaper <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape "a lie" and said people were "seeking to make a name for themselves".
His lawyers have prepared to take the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has printed the charges, to court.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel said on Friday that it had paid the woman $375,000 to keep the incident a secret.
Speaking to 142 million followers on a live-streamed Instagram video a few hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports and called them “a hoax.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today, the lies, was spoken five times by the winner of the Ballon d’Or, looking at the camera.
They want to make a name for themselves.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name is part of my job.
I'm a happy person, everything's fine," the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring Der Spiegel to justice on charges they have called "unacceptable disclosure of suspicions about things going on in private space."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for “moral harm that would be commensurate with the significance of this violation – perhaps one of the most serious violations of a person’s rights in the past few years.”
The alleged incident took place in Las Vegas in June 2009 at the Palms Casino and Hotel Apartments.
According to documents submitted to the Nevada Clark County Court, after meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal manner.
Mayorga said that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo hit the road and told her that he was "99 percent a good man" who was betrayed by "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sexual relations, but claimed that they had been consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had approached the police and her hospital injuries had been photographed, but she later agreed to a no-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliatory action" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal as she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was unstoppable from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, having signed a contract worth 100 million euros, he joined the Italian giant Juventus.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Brexit: UK regrets lost automakers forever
According to Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark, the UK would “forever regret” the loss of its global car manufacturing leadership following Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about a statement by Toyota's UK unit to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily halted at the Burnastone factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the loss of jobs would mean a no-deal Brexit at the border.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said Burnastone CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and its implications for international trade.
For example, BMW says that after Brexit, it will close its Mini plant for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the most worrying are the threats that will arise for the supply chain “Brexit” without a contract.
The Toyota production line works when needed, as parts for custom-made cars are delivered from both the UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border; according to the industry, this may result in delays or missing parts.
Toyota said it could not store more than one day’s supply at the Derbyshire plant, so production would stop.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "prepared precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract, we want to have the best contract, which, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but also other car manufacturers' data show that it is necessary to continue to use a very successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say for what time the production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working at the Burnastone plant for 24 years and is responsible for the Unite trade union meetings, said his union members are increasingly worried: “I’m saying from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed goals and a credible future relationship with the EU plan."
According to the White House, Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
“As the fight continues for a Supreme Court nominee, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week,” the White House said in a statement.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election interference, Trump’s aides’ ties with Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will pardon the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, amid reports of resignations, he went to the White House on Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
The meeting was later postponed in order to avoid a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations within a week, again delaying the vote in the Senate plenary session.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It’s not fixed. It can happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it can be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report the news to the press."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: as of September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
Manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that press conferences are rarely held not because he doesn’t like “effects-seeking” TV journalists. True, he added: “I have to agree with the fact that they are effects-seeking viewers.”
At the time, he said, Trump was more likely to communicate directly with the press.
“The president answers questions more often than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing any evidence, “We’ve looked at these statistics.”
According to Sanders, the press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’ve often tried to do that, and you’ve seen that happen many times over the last few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States.”
The short answer to the questions is constantly leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with distinguished guests.
One-person press conferences are rarely held.
The president’s free and sometimes bizarre appearance before reporters this week in New York probably explained why.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS workers from the EU about Brexit fears <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Scotland’s health minister has written a letter to EU workers expressing the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector entrusted to it.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “In the summer, the UK and EU negotiations on withdrawal have continued and are approaching the solutions expected this autumn.
But the U.K. government began to prepare more quickly for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that you are all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system, benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury after undergoing an emergency surgery
The Vanderbilt Commodores lost the game to a Tennessee State Tigers defenseman, Christion Abercrombie, in an emergency surgery on Saturday at 31:27, Tennesseean journalist Mike Organas said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
“He came to the sideline and just slipped there,” Reed said.
Trainers and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline breathed oxygen, then laid on stretchers and sent for further tests.
Tennessee State Officer Chris Harris of the Nashville (Tennessee) WSMV said the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that “there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury,” and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie, who officially spent the sports season, moved from Illinois to play in the Tennessee State team for the first season.
Before leaving the game, he won five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he won during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher mark-up fee
Under the new tory plans, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher stamp duty, and the extra money they receive will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reduce the risk posed by Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
UK tax-exempt persons will be taxed on the increased excise duty
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year and allocate it to the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of UK real estate will be taxed at a higher rate of nominal tax, while the additional money received will be used to help the homeless.
With the promise of cheaper housing and high-income people, this move is expected to reduce the risk posed by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to attract young voters.
The increased excise duty will be levied on UK tax-exempt individuals and businesses, and the additional money received will be used by the Government to promote a campaign to combat homelessness.
The additional fee – paid next to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second home or house buyers – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, resulting in higher prices and making it harder for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, which is why many of the country’s rich and especially capital districts have become ghosts of cities.
The new strategy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a significant tax cut to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of buying land quickly but not using it to support high real estate prices, and urged May to address the shame of Britain’s housing supply by abandoning affordable housing quotas.
Corbyn announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including rent control and a no-fault ban.
In addition, he wants more power to build new houses for municipal councils.
May said: “Last year I said that as prime minister I would seek to restore the British dream – for every new generation life must be better.
This means that we need to fix our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not right that UK non-residents and companies set up abroad can buy a home as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of having a home has become almost unfulfilled, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to someday become Scotland's national team leader.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in the Premier League and three points behind the club in first place.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made it to the B team and it all came to an end," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
“But as a child, I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my father watching a lot of Scottish national football matches, and that always made me want to come back.
This will only happen if I manage the club successfully.’
Ross's Sunderland was led by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager, who had previously rejected the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals, said he did not feel anxious to start working under such well-known managers at such a large club.
"Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
According to the structure and conditions, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"Then it's not an easy task to take him away, but maybe I'll think I've been successful here when I bring the club back to the league."
Ross's management career lasted only three years, before which he worked as a manager's assistant at the Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts' coach for 15 months.
He later helped to recover Alloa, who fell in the third division, and St Mirren, who was threatened with falling, became the champions of the championship the following season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he has ever felt in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This change was probably radical,” he recalls of Alloa’s leadership.
“I honestly thought it was better for me to lead than to play.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I earned a lot and I was happy with the satisfactory results.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to deal with a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I’m doing it. As an adult, I’ve always felt like I was in my own corner, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction.”

Research has shown that the best time for a pint of beer is on Saturday at 17.30.
The summer heat wave has increased the incomes of Britain’s poor brewers, but has made the burden on restaurant chains even more difficult.
Figures revealed that in July, sales of breweries and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from CGA, a business consulting firm that compiled the data, said: “The never-ending sunset and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup meant that similar trends continued in July than in June, when brewers’ incomes fell below 2.8 per cent.
In June, restaurant trade fell by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The results of the main revenues from the beer and bar trade were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew stronger than it decreased in the restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sunflower also suffered a major loss of revenue from the sale of beer.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-managed breweries and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman from RSM, a leisure and fertility analysis firm, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
As far as food establishments are concerned, the main factors continue to be the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer. True, the 4.8 per cent drop in sales over the course of a year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the ongoing cost pressure.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the companies receiving the most income from the food trade. Time will show whether the milder August feel the temperature will provide the much-needed respite."
Overall sales growth in breweries and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of networks owned by brands.

One in five children have social media accounts that are hidden from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some as young as 11 – have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a primary account.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing rapidly, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored primary account to show their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, learned that the teenager was insisting on saying, “Extract me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>18-year-old students have two accounts, and half of such students admitted to hiding accounts.
Mike Buchanan, MDK leader, said: “The fact that so many teenagers are succumbing to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
At the annual general meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Council for Sport, Eilidha Doyle was elected as its director’s consultant.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and chairwoman. Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the diverse international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidha has earned a great deal of respect across the Scottish, UK and global sports community and we have no doubt that her inclusion in the council will bring great benefits to Scottish sport,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope I will really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlantic Games, now appears as a permanent BBC expert after suffering a short-term ischemic attack, was unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether and to what extent I will recover.
I had to work until exhaustion, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging message!"
Breastfeeding advertising, in which mothers are compared to cows, received different ratings on the Internet
The company that produces breast milk received different opinions about its advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of a product described as the world’s first silent breast lift, consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic music video-inspired ad aimed at demonstrating the freedom that nursing mothers can enjoy.
Four real mothers dance to a sound recording in a full-bodied cowhide, where they hear, for example, the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but no tails to see" and "If you haven't noticed, here are not blacks, here are my breasts."
The appendix continues: "Extract it, extract it, feed it babies, extract it, extract it, milk my beauties."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has caused an online dispute.
Viewers reacted in a variety of ways to the video, which was viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments. Many said that it looked through the fingers at the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows for advertising this product is a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their newborns are taken from them after a few days," one woman wrote.
Elvie's breaststroke inconspicuously fits in the feeding vest ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It is understood that this traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why didn’t they use it to advertise breast milk for mothers who don’t have babies?”
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the ad – one woman admitted that the song appeared to her “very funny”.
“I think the idea is genius.
I would buy it if I was still eating.
When I stopped drinking, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as what it is.
This product is genius," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun ad is for moms who take their milk off (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to intoxicate or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they were all dancing with inconspicuous pacifiers mounted on their bras.
The campaign’s idea is based on the perception that many women who stop breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milkshake does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes, and inconspicuously fits in the feeding vest – so women can move around freely, keep babies or even leave the house when they leave the milk.
Mother’s partner and chief creative officer Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie’s milkshake is a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed boldly and provocatively.
Compared to dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the cessation of milk and all the challenges it poses, while having fun and showing as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new milkshake will give.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pen has been included in the press headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski’s collection of two children’s mother on the podium demonstrated using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tented camp near the Texas border.
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially in a month, but the number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration making it harder for them to live with their guardians.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for childcare risked being able to stay in the country.
When the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and the data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk was even greater.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had applied for adult care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
“Nearly 80 per cent of these people – the guardians or their family members – live in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people," Albence said.
According to the asylum workers, in order to consider children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of arrest, and not within 60 days, as was customary previously.
Many people will try to defend a request for legal status against a judge on immigration issues, not by coming in personally, but by using a conference call video.
Those who do not have the right to receive assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter staff and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to forced outbursts or attempts to escape.
Defenders say that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as the Tornillo shelter: due to their size, there is a greater chance of not not not noticing signs that the child is being bullied.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can deepen the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces disguised as counter-terrorism forces in Syria are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus will not stop fighting this holy fight until we destroy terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all areas of Syria.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for them to return are good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unfounded fear that prevents refugees from returning.
“We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will only come to Syria once Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces aimed at a province of three million people.
Mr Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meetings of a committee composed of members of the Government and the opposition soon, which will prepare the draft post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the ground for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee – the group’s work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned not to interfere.
Why would Trump be elected to a second term?
Based on this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers might expect, his presidency would end in an impeachment and scandal.
This would be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
There are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable TV ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“It’s a fire that draws people because we don’t understand something,” said Neal Baeri, who is producing ABC’s “Descendants” about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after an attack on the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of “Only the Fun Parts and Few Unpleasant Truths About How to Secretly Get into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘He makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
Chaos is worth having fun.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the storylines coming out of Washington may decide the Roe vs. Wade case, the possibility of uniting immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Non-viewing is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than necessary to be informed by a citizen when you realize that it’s been six hours since the Washington Post has seen a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses undisclosed data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s demonstration of a $15,000-a-year-old ostrich-skinned shooter.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
“His actions are like a reality show because he throws something at you every night,” says Wheelhouse Entertainment’s CEO and Brewner’s CEO, Starwn, about the changing characters in the Trump show and the daily twists in the plot.
You can't miss a single episode or you'll be late.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, there was 27 degrees of heat and sunlight, but he was thundering inside and watching MSNBC while recording for CNN.
He couldn’t tear himself up – certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember when we used to do these crazy shows, people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleissas said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

In the tense midterm elections to the House of Representatives in March, money is pouring from around
No wonder that the congressional district reshuffle, which culminated in the two House of Representatives’ attempt to win the same post, spilled money into Pennsylvania’s 17th district.
The recently revamped suburban district of Pittsburgh put Democratic Representative Conor Lamb on the ballot, winning his seat in a special election in another district last spring.
Lambas competes with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing Pennsylvania's former 12th district, much of which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in violation of the old county constitution, they had been falsified in favor of Republicans.
During the election campaign in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK) – were concerned about the campaign’s finances.
Lambs rose to prominence in Pennsylvania when he won a narrow majority in the 18th congressional district in a widely-viewed special election in March.
For more than a decade, the seat was taken by Republicans, with President Donald Trump gaining 20 points in the county.
Political experts have given the Democrats some of this advantage.
The U.S. is considering punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then calming it down.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but had not received a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and, until the partners moved the Trump Organization leadership, had a hotel in the country.
"Recently, the decision to withdraw from the Taiwan State Department has been taken by officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to recall the heads of the American diplomatic missions," the department's spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But the sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received around $140 million in US aid in 2017, as well as drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions for specific individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. It was supposed to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussions about sanctions on El Salvador.
“In order to demonstrate the importance of the administration for this meeting, Vice President Mike Pence is now included in the list of speakers of the conference scheduled for mid-October,” the diplomats said.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without notifying Washington of any reprisals or punishments.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, said they agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity is preserved.
Learn the history
The report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice can be expected to continue, with very strong evidence now available in public archives.
In addition, as they say, Mueller’s investigation raises the question of whether the Trump campaign was not conducted in secret in cooperation with our elections, harming Russia.
If Congress were to change hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution — at the same time as he prepares to stand again in front of voters, and perhaps finally in front of the executive committee.
There’s a lot of “ifs” here, and I’m not saying that the end of Trump is inevitable – like his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will last long.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler – all that was needed was for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We got tired and missed the opportunity to prevent several years of carnage.
History revolves around such fundamental turning points – then the unbridled march of democracy is accelerated or stalled.
Now the Americans have found themselves at a number of such fundamental turning points.
What will we do if Trump pardons Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the fate of Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein’s troubles began when the newspaper reported that an official last year offered to secretly record the president and discussed his inadequacy to take office.
Rosenstein claims that The Times’ story is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite compelling allegations of sexual violence and false evidence, this candidate is brought to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections that will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is in danger of a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew. She was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once based in the house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years, I was sent to light a candle on a table with a swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look to our future in a non-optimistic way?”

Graham Dorrans optimistically looks forward to meeting with Rapid Vienna from Rangers
On Thursday, the Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna, knowing that if after impressive races with Villarreal against the Austrians earlier this month in Spain, they could find themselves in a strong position to leave the G group.
With a midfield injury, Graham Dorrans was only able to make his debut this season in a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he hopes the Rangers could use the result as a springboard for more important goals.
“For us, this result was good because Villarreal is a great team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started playing with the belief that we were going to achieve something, and we finished with that.
Maybe in the end we could have been more peaceful, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first leg and we got in the second and showed who we are in the better team.
There will be another important European League night on Thursday.
I hope that we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the last competitions their result was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can roll forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was a really tough year – and what happened to my injuries, and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good mood there.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that now we can go forward, forget about last season and play well.”
Because of this pension savings fear, a woman is suffering from insomnia
While the survey participants had a clear idea of what care they would like to receive, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not trying to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not communicate your wishes in advance, you will not prepare the family to take care of you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Call a financial advisor. A financial advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to pay for long-term care with a supporting traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed money<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>value life insurance certificate, or by securing your assets as long as you have the money.
Select the legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by protecting them with enabling documents.
Select a health care mandate. Designate a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals will respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become inefficient.
Do not forget the details. Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and takes him or her to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be prepared, write down these details in the plan.
“It’s not just financial issues. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan that, too.”
Man shot several times with Ilfrakume pneumatic rifle
After spending the night in the city, a man who had gone home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The victim was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm at the age of 40 in the Ilfracum-Oxford Grey district of Devon.
The shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. in England’s summertime, was described by officials as a random act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police ask for the help of witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
“At least 384 people were killed when the Indonesian city of Palu was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on Friday,” officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise further.
Due to the destruction of communications services, officials could not receive any data from the regency of Dongala, a region north of Palu, located near the 7.5-point earthquake epicenter.
In the wake of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about the island of Sulawesi in Palu and Dongala.
With a population of 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake struck and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency woman who wanders along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) north-west of Sulawesi Island.
In Regency – behind the province in the smaller administrative region – in 2017 there were about 299,200 inhabitants.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on the other side of Sulawesi in Moroval.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the country.
In addition, a tsunami struck western Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia, which is in the midst of a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is constantly reeling from earthquakes.
Here are some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and beginning of April 2005, several strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near it.
A 6.8-point quake in 2006 shook the southernmost part of the densely populated Indonesian island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-point quake struck an area near the western capital of Sumatra province, Padang.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a 7.5-point quake struck one of the Mentavaya islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami with waves reaching up to 10 meters, wiping out dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
In 2016, due to the unstable earthquake in Aceh, the regency of the Paddy Jaya was devastated and panicked, as people remembered how everything was devastated after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not go away, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of the buildings.
In 2018, strong tremors rocked Indonesia’s busy island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stranded on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the attack.
A police report released on Saturday said Palin, 29, from Vasilos, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and resisting detention.
According to a police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Palin was returned to the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility for life and released for a $500 security deposit.
“On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he was asked to plead guilty and pleaded not guilty,” the network said in a statement.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
The incident is linked to the January 2016 charges against him of assaulting his home, preventing him from reporting the crime of domestic violence and holding a gun while being indiscriminate.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when she linked her son’s brutal behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, which arose from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia kill hundreds of people
At least 384 people died after a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. The number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video is shared on social media, which shows the moment of the tsunami.
A tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Death Penalty for Suspected New York Terrorist Attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, 1930, Saipov rented a truck from Home Depot and staged an attack on bicycles along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – while driving on a track, laying down pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in southern New York County on the intent to seek the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court document, both of these charges can delay the death penalty.
After the attack a few weeks later, the federal grand jury issued a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included eight counts of murder related to the rape of property (usually used by federal prosecutors for organized crime involving motor vehicle offences), and a charge against the accused.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well-planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov executed it has been described as vile, cruel, and immoral.
“The actions of Sayfull Habibullaevich Saipov have injured, injured and lost loved ones of the following family members and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernandez-Alejandro Pahrucci and Hernandez-Damn<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The latest case to call for the death penalty was in New York’s Southern District a decade ago.
Accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in 1953 in a New York federal case against the spouses of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when they were convicted two years ago of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The death penalty for both Rosenbergs was carried out in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by videos of Islamic State (ISIS) he was watching on his phone to carry out the attack.
Police said he also asked the hospital to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the palace.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federally-funded defenders, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than admitting guilt and jailing to life without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Tory MP says that the Brexit negotiations must be held accountable by Nigel Farage
Today, in a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the heat of eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have stepped down by now if Farage had been Brexit’s secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unify the divided ranks of supporters have been exposed by EU-backed thugs who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement a compromise plan agreed in her Chequers when she is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it should try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihale that he wanted to ruin Cheker's plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already left the EU," he said.
A member of parliament in Wellington added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In world wars, we did not fight to obey others.
We want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone denied hints that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Cheker’s plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him. He is unpopular also with our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a critical note to May, she added: “Premiers keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said the rallying politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they make a 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it is a matter of our trust, of the people and of our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to give Brexit away, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which has almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom."
And the opponents of Brexit, before holding a two-hour rally in the city center, walked the streets of Birmingham.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists waved “Tories Against Brexit” posters.
Labour leader Lord Adonis scolded the Conservatives over the security issues they faced with the party’s app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, frictionless borders and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a meeting with the public in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, is taking part in the November re-election that will pit him against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that she may face Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon’s event in Holjok has been her 36th meeting with voters using the public meeting format.
One participant asked if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that the time had come for women to go to Washington to fix the collapsed government, and women must lead the way.
Suspect Arrested in LSU Simso Shooting Case
Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested the suspect, who was charged with shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked to help identify the man seen in it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and died near a southern university town early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday that Wayde Sims had been shot in the head and died from injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, possessing a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained unopposed and was placed under arrest by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in the starting fifth, averaged 17.4 minutes per game, earned 5.6 points per game, and scored 2.9 points per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world champion title as team orders him to give Sebastian Vettel victory
When Valtteri Bott beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team’s direction in the race would be crucial.
Starting the race from the first place, Bottas started well and, defending his position in the first two laps, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to turn in a two-door garage, left Hamilton, and he returned to the race in the group's tail, so it was fateful.
Mercedes turned to the two-block garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after barely finishing the action, burst forward when the driver of the Ferrari after a double maneuver, in order to maintain the position in the third corner, did not reach the middle of the track.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the end of the run, but by the end of the first lap he was already seventh.
He was the fastest in most of the race as he drove without changing tyres to make it to the finish as fast as possible, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
In the last 44 laps he turned into a two-lane garage, but the remaining eight laps failed to increase the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in the fourth.
“Valter had a tough day because he was doing great all weekend, and when he was asked to spend it, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday scolded Senator Dianne Feinstein over her persistent denial of a leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is accused of sexual assault.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly name the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are indecent, indecent and unfair.
“What could have happened and has actually happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see that people are angry, you don’t want to do it, you don’t want to do it, you don’t want to do it, you don’t want to do it,” he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you escaped?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did the document leak? “Oh, oh, what?
I don't think so.
I didn't escape."
Well, wait a minute.
We ran away... no, we didn’t,” he added, posing as a senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh, which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: “I haven’t hidden Dr. Ford’s accusations and I haven’t lost her story.”
“She asked to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, it seems that the president did not agree with her denial. He said during a meeting with people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really bad body language.
She may not have lost it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of a Supreme Court judge who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats used the charges to their advantage.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see vanity, indecentness; they don’t care what they hurt or what they have to go through in order to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer has won two goals in the match with Dandi club Giants
The Dundee Stars claimed Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants and won Saturday's resounding Dandi 5-3.
The Giants made an early breakthrough when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored two goals in the first half.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had equalled the score, before Dwyer brought the Giants forward again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard of the Dandi team equalised the result, but later two goals from Lukas Lundwald Nielsen secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered a third loss this season in the Elite League, beating Belfast on Friday night and beating Dandi club 2–1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, with three previous matches won by the Giants.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaullo's pass, and after four more minutes, Beauvillier doubled the lead after David Rutherford's pass.
In the hard-fought games, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game with a score of 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cownie equalized the score of 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came out on the first break in the lead, and at the end of the first half he earned his second night goal.
Having a quantitative overview, the owners of the square regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the score 27:37.
Cownie<0xCA><0xBC>is and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen break through the Dandi team for the first time in the game at the end of the second leg, and cemented the win by winning the fifth team in the middle of the last leg.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
The pilot-in-command was killed to help hundreds of plane passengers escape an earthquake.
Indonesia’s chief flight officer was declared a hero when he died while helping a plane carrying several hundred passengers safely take to the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are thought to be missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The site was further hit by heavy repeated underground strikes and many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily swaying management tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained at his workplace to help the 6321 flight attendant Batik Air, who was already on the runway at the time, get up safely.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower is falling, he jumped out of it.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning, the helicopter had not yet reached Palu.
“This is a very sad news for us,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the country’s disaster-reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigi and Boutonga are hard to reach.
“The number of victims is expected to rise further as many victims are still under the rubble and we cannot reach them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to a height of six meters, the waves destroyed the city of Palu; it will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supply of supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute speeding cars bring in the victims.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are looted everywhere .'
Janis Gelfand, head of Indonesia’s International Red Cross, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Jokas Widodas arrived in Palu on Sunday and appealed to the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was rocked by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane Crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Claims One Man Has Disappeared After Falling into Lagoon
The flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia, the airline now says one person is missing, although it has previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the plane.
In the report, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of a single passenger man.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in its search for the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane, attempting to land at Chukchi Island airport, crashed into the water.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing zone.
Some witnesses to the incident believe that the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low plane.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to make it to the emergency exits on a plane that was sinking and flooded to the waist.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said it had also helped rescue people who had been blown up by a boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Nugini.
Analyst lays out the sequence of events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office laid out the facts in a retrial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained how he used mobile phone records to link the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers to the movement on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with a friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford made his statement and testified that he was not in his city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, saying he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “liest because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another misunderstanding was that Telly claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Mobile phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and addressee information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
It is expected that the defense will begin to discuss its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he believed the case would be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hiphop trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre, their music spreading positive messages.
Bristol-based The High Breed says hip-hop is moving away from the roots of political messages and drawing attention to social issues.
They want to go back to the origins of hip-hop and re-populate the conscious hip-hop.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have recently revived UK artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City babysitter brought a couple to court after she was fired from her job over a “racist” message
A New York nurse has filed a lawsuit against the couple for dismissal from their job over discrimination after receiving a message from her mother sent to the wrong address that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied the allegations and called the lawsuit “rape.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was shocked to learn that Giselle Maurice, the new baby-sitter, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEE, BUT ONE BLACK,” Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, she was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, knowing Plasco-Flaxman had acted recklessly, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Mr. Maurice, saying that the former nanny, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home in an Uber car.
Now Maurice has brought the couple to court demanding compensation for the redundancy and seeks to claim as much as $350 a day for half a year of living and working in a client’s home, for which she was initially hired even though without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do these things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple backed down on accusations of racism by denying it and said it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” the man, Joel Plascas, told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you were unkind to, even if it was a mistake?
Your new-born?
They don't."
Plascas, who likened the lawsuit to “rape,” said his wife had just given birth to a baby two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not a very nice behavior,” added the investment banking specialist.
While the court case is being heard, the media hastened to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A New Letter Reveals That Paddington Publishers Are Afraid Readers Won't Understand the Talking Bear
Born shortly after the book was accepted, Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel like someone else is reading the book for the first time until it’s been published.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked for the BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush bear, would not have been overly upset if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was the year after his father’s death and the year after his death had passed.
Speaking about Padington, whom she describes as a “very important family member,” she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty calm person and didn’t like to get drunk,” she said.
“Because Paddington was so similar to himself, he felt like he had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he was similarly appreciating Paddington's success story.
Although this was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nico Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
“The nade kept calling and saying that the condition was really bad, it’s not expected that she will survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nada, who called to say that she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, "Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given by the doctors that supported her heartbeat slowly stopped working and were removed from the body.
She died a little while ago and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to keep it to myself.”
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for his dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, not realizing what a difficult test she needed to overcome.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and tears were shed all the time.
It is difficult to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women’s suicide cards are designed to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distribute postcards on the Bridge of Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he fell ill and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want one parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidny, said her son was a very promising boss with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up the room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother killed.
Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid that there may be a chain reaction.”
Davis wrote, “I want people to know that there are people around who can be approached and talked to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mr Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Marko, who died shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, and didn’t complain,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
During Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children unwrapped their gifts, he did not look them in the eye and did not react in any way.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It left an emptiness in the family.
It hurts our heart.
We all have to live and fight.”

When the FBI launched the investigation, Bretto Kavanaugh’s future hung in the balance.
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for – a limited-time and large-scale study – maybe we could bring in a little unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “burdened” with strong supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their opposition is determined only by time.
The midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, are just five weeks away, and if Republicans are expected to turn out badly, their efforts to elect the person they want to head the country’s highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bushui in the White House and met his wife Ashley, Bush’s former personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and pass him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters 'declined' as Kim comes to power
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said 1,127 deserters were identified last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said key factors had been tightened border controls between North Korea and China and increased human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many of the North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were stalled in negotiations on a nuclear weapons waiver.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when the two agreed in principle to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not changing its sanctions.
“If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally arm ourselves first,” Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi dismisses Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview he gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I just can’t help but think that if a woman did that, she would be said to be hysterical,” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, when he talked about family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes without starting to scream or whine.
He also slammed former Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations "grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation" by the liberals, angering that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s evidence proved he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his biased approach to Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the Clintons and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Asked if he would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy were approved and Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi said.
"I will say this: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, it is not appropriate to take office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is currently working," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals for Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for us to say, hysterically, biasedly, to the judge: 'How wonderful!'" Pelosi said.
The Power Women Should Use
This is a legitimate criticism – finally months and even a year of accumulated tension, which she cannot express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It’s not unusual for me, is it?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman, the head of a company, who told me that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a method: when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to at the time, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of one of the first jobs in the office, where mostly men worked, and where I once started to cry over the unspeakable anger. Then an elderly woman grabbed me for the armpit, a sharp head, which I was always a little afraid of, and pushed me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he told me.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be happy to beat you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Democratic Party Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when G. Hart was caught alienating on the ship "Monkey Business" and withdrew his candidacy, deeply disappointed P. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he joked to me 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so we didn’t really need another one.
Someone called me "Snowflake with seven dwarfs."
When the campaign started late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she vowed not to announce her candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an unequal struggle.
She noticed that some of the sponsors, who donated $1,000 to the men, only gave her $250.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she asked.
Speaking in a speech announcing the start of a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions – people who supported gratitude, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, rather than representatives, and anger over sexism – that she complained.
“You would have thought I was getting nervous,” Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press to her speech.
– You would think that I am supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking about what would be inscribed on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How U.S. and Chinese Trade Generations Can Benefit Beijing
The first salvos in the U.S.-China trade war were staged, and although the battle is far from over, experts say, the disagreement may eventually prove beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year by taxing China’s major exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, earlier this year.
The sharpest opposition came this week when new tariffs came into effect affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which will essentially tax half of China’s exports to the US.
Beijing responded to all the measures by imposing a five- to ten-percent tariff on US goods with a total value of $60 billion in the latest decision.
China has sworn to fight the US tooth by tooth, and it seems that this second largest global market is definitely not going to land in the near future.
Washington would ease sanctions only if China complied with the demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too hard on Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing wins its party over properly, the difficulties of trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cripple the economies of both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have so far acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia New America Security Center.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says It's Ready to Accept Returning Refugees
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"As a result of progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government continues to work to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists and restore the normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions directed against daily life and well-being have already been established.
According to UN estimates, since the beginning of the war in 2011, Syria has left about 5.5 million Syrians.
Six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in restoring the devastated country.
However, it also stressed that the country will not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup on the continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, enough to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, struck from the starting pitch directly into the water during the match against Francesco Molinari on the 3rd day of the 16th hole.
Italian player F. Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained its current form.
The American Jordan Spieth 5:4 beat the lowest-ranked European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter, an Englishman who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish veteran of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments, became the most successful European player of the tournament, scoring a career point of 25.5 points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to B. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his native John Ram, who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's unit game.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 biggest prizes and descended only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the driveway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated high-level play throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fury said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we Europeans began to press.
We walked.
I'm wearing a hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to bend your head.
Our opponents were superior to us.”
