In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it is necessary for them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at home, and that the contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on a white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter read.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who was teaching two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would travel 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot popular professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, students and faculty were forced to hide behind locked doors, with the authorities still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by state investigators, as well as students and staff who knew him, together created the image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, thanking the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with other 17 faculty members and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it came to problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamb must have suffered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot wound to the back of the house about a mile from his parents in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
The Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 residents, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who taught her to play the guitar for several years.
At the time, it was quite heartbreaking.
The hearts of all the girls found out as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was my mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when they and Abigail stepped up to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat that Lamb had hit on guitar and harmonica for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We joked and joked with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in his first year specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended the candlelight memorial event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended a vigil during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reportage.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but a manufacturer of children’s toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting this month, and will recruit staff during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees for help in the shops and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his ‘random’ with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie starts and I happen to be within reach of something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The “Back to the Future” premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “It’s really the best travel document that has ever been filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and select cinemas in October.
U.N. chief says no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in the Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like an unlucky joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But no matter how many Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, they’re not (yet).
Ten out of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead on a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously question what this means for this real estate tycoon’s nomination chances.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, not one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run in the general election.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and are beginning to spend their dollars at a standstill in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent polling numbers that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s assessment of favorability turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers hold up in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it turned out that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “excited” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "disgusted" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “excited” versus 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if Jeb Bush’s favorite business became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his rants and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senators' Club, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s the change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
This time last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump will still defeat almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one game.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made their point.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump-backed voters say they won’t change their mind anymore.
It’s obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46% say they keep the back door open for change between candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has remained the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s embitterment is distracting key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and damaging efforts at rebranding.
But according to a new Monday public opinion poll by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
A vote by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly angry.”
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal levies.
The Czech Republic will receive more than $400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported a government amendment to the Upper Law, which regulates the amount of fees for surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised MPs that thanks to this they will get extra money both from the state treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The bill has been criticized by opposition MPs who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor companies as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government amendment of the upper law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a larger share of the proceeds from the state.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The template also changes the method of calculating the payment for the minerals that the companies will extract.
The change in the fees for mining of minerals is expected to bring to the state treasury by 427 million CZK more than in 2013.
According to the government, the municipality's budget revenues should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
The mining of brown coal cost the municipalities about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in payments from mining areas with a permit for mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that thanks to this, the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million crowns annually instead.
The amount of mining charges will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The compensation shall be newly calculated as the sum of the amount of the extracted ore and the rates for the individual types of ore.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the imposition of a fee by a government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek, this is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging interest on the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are only received by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will go to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same will apply to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects from the mining charges will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The model was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm mining communities and regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayorov<0xC3><0xA1>) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the finance minister improves his budget," said David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, KS<0xC4><0x8C>M member Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned.
K<0xC3><0xA1>dner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted the law back to the government to be finalized.
The rationale is that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, since prices are contracted from more than 90 percent in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or thermal power plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in compensation by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, the Commission considers that the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is approved.
If coal is to be exploited beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek that the decision to break the threshold at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken already for social, national economic reasons as well as for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> will lead the Czech Republic as the number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board and this time each of them is likely to hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til plans to distribute the load to the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so it is expected to be tough matches that can stretch up to five hundred meters.
We have to take this into account.
I would like to spread it out according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, said Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til during today's training of Czech selection in the center of R<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC5><0xBE>e Kum<0xC3><0xA1>r Kh<0xC3><0xA1>nny.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts with one team and the world’s 40th team until Friday and Sunday doubles.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek will probably play in the position of the pair.
I would like almost everyone to get involved.
"I've got it in my head a little bit, but I'm not going to say it yet," the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech squad should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka’s participation in Saturday’s doubles.
It’s just a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblist, who has a doubles 18:4 in Davis Cup.
It probably won't be happy.
There are still options left with Rosol or Adam Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sk.
"I really don't know with whom and what it will look like," he said.
It is decided according to the development of doubles.
The variant can be Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek, with Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> surprised in the 1st round win in the doubles over the Australians.
'He's decent in the barn, 'said Revr<0xC3><0xA1>til.
I managed against Australia, and when I play, I would like to perform the same performance that I showed there from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring a point," Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek said.
Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the players of the third and fourth hundred of the ranking.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
They’re both challengers, and our players have experience with the ATP Tour, but we’ve seen a lot of times that the Davis Cup rankings don’t decide.
"It decides the current form, the weather," Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til said.
Friday opening matches will start at 6:30 CEST and can be extended due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it's supposed to be raining, and the yard isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting.
They've already set it on fire, and it's got about 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s PMQ debut is highly anticipated.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time will be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be scrutinised carefully by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theaters and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC’s annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during a national anthem song in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the front page of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in respectful silence" and recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, citing differences in economics, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in the work also "strive" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn over his position in the European Union and the government's limit on benefits.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of benefits.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of Shadow Work and Pensions, said the party was "very clearly" opposed to government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Labour Party, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that the PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both “ready-made responses” and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him at the PMQ when he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also let go of the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time because he had been told that he was still discussing the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders’ judgment, their leadership of the House, and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Focusing in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising as wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven higher by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB’s profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it looked like estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after getting a closer offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer together.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the Mondi package and paper group were the biggest drop on the index and fell 4.3% after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on the company to "sales."
JD Sports surged 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% mid-year jump in pre-tax earnings of <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says the higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment marshmeloun rejoice.
The controversial building has been put on hold.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investementi considers the annulment of the decision illegal and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the building, which is to be built in the vicinity of Ane<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ter in the center of Prague, and petitions were filed.
The Magistrate in the decision stated that there was a violation of the construction law, because all the requirements of the territorial decision were not respected.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain any relevant elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the impact of the construction," the decision reads.
It also considers it illegal for the Magistrate to issue certain grounds for the decision to the originally discussed documentation, which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file material that the owner of the land has only confirmed his agreement with the project documentation for territorial management, not with the location of the building on their land, writes the building code department.
According to Francesc Augusto Razetta of the investment firm, the construction law department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the start of the review has already passed.
This is, after all, a scandalous process.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call the marshmallow in Prague because of the supposedly designed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions.
In the past, hundreds of people gathered in the center of the city to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby homes are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fr<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which had a glazed facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and cancelled in 2010 the permission of Prague monuments.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NP<0xC3><0x9A> as well as the municipal authorities and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the reproaches of the opponents, saying that he never counted on the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname for pink-white candy.
The Czech politician took away the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in a bassoon with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who were said to have wanted to travel about half a kilometer.
At the time, he said, it wasn’t a crime in Hungary, according to the People’s Daily.
We knew that the law enforcers did not object to such an act.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and took us to the investigation prison in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours.
The police said they behaved correctly, but communication was hampered because they did not speak English very well.
But the prison was sad.
For example, in our cell about three times four meters in size, 15 refugees from Syria were squeezed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were closed the next day, and because of the language barrier, no one knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can no longer be amused?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9., the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, will answer readers’ questions from 9:30 am.
You can ask her about the changes to the law on executions valid from September 1, 2015 and other matters related to executions, or executors.
Metcash Launches Countryside Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s raids in South and Western Australia.
Metcash Launches Countryside Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as A Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers join brands such as the Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware vendor will celebrate its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA businesses enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will account for 5 percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening the first stores to take over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the Metcash fixed price base could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could be “highly likely to disappear within a decade.”
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the profits from the Metcash food business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retail stores, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational developments in changing speculation as sales and returns are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have moved into counterattack and are investing more than $150 million a year to level the bar prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip their stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, said the price-matching and trade-retail programs are catching on, and he hopes big business will return to bottom-line profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis endorsed by President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a minor loss in a recent habit around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called the "Special Ks," attracted unwelcome attention thanks to the affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by referees, Harrison then stated, "Wawrinka had to pull one for Kyrgios and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after his convulsion crushed Richard Gasquet's possible downfall at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for second place behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the United Kingdom.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little entangled in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost due to a concussion in the U.S., but he is not the first player to vent his anger on his rocket due to frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he really managed very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a bit harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits well in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own.
Healy also supported the decision to miss Kyrgiose due to an important match starting on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has arisen around it,” Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray, and other people point out, he's growing in the eyes of the public, he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and he's going to do it for me, and I'm going to listen to him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted in a revolt.
Those who have been stuck for an unknown time in the land belts between the two states are those who run away from violence in their native countries, build their tents and live in them.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call "Open the borders!" and hand over the orderly units of the Hungarian police.
Some people are refusing food and water to protest.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
During the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the bloc of 28 states failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in Italy and Greece, and spoke in hopes of reaching a possible deal next month or the end of the year that would be accepted by more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special EU-European summit next week to discuss a continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not turn its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up asylum trials.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who seek a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of the 4-meter fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have made it quite clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already been caught on state territory.
They have penetrated through damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed-wire tow truck.
At the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos ensued, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal processing container and people’s presses were created.
About 20 of them came in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is making her lead.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main contests, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that they are clearly the decision which candidate they will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.
According to a CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders gained some.
Clinton keeps a big lead among the women and softens, but her leadership narrows.
Her support among the men has dropped significantly and Sanders is only losing 5 points on her.
Clinton’s advantage with democratic voters under 50 has evaporated and now they are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only losing 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are especially passionate about her.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it follows that it’s time to be a woman president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Furthermore, a great possibility of choice and agreement on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him face-to-face — a third think he shouldn’t run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for party nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Clinton supporters cited more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely elective is rising.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of a candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of an election.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party’s primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and credible, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads out of all three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are consistent with their ideological views.
As for all of these criteria, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as a state secret continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, it’s a different story altogether.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on the issue were divided as early as March, shortly after the issue emerged.
The majority of Americans say that this email controversy has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Despite Clinton being seen as honest and trustworthy among her party’s voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, a decline of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don’t think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters have not made up their minds about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election
Ben Carson Approaches Donald Trump in Latest CBS News/New York Times Poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a landslide, climbing from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson leads well across demographic groups, and excludes Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, fell behind Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the 10% support ladder to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans behind Trump’s 32% support.
A recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot blindly at a neurosurgeon on duty, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-Year Student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during a fraternal exaggeration ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, she was charged with murdering five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and the delayed ones took him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, had a backpack full of sand weighing <0xC2><0xA3>30 and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's dress, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically gave preference to the welfare of the fraternity over the life of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit with a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by fraternal abuse, and at least one student has been dying every year from the abuse since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must take responsibility, and this step is important on the part of the institutions.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity abolished its relationship with local branches.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
Rate growth will come and the bull market will tumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike will start, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the buzz due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low level to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last month or so, the expected rate increase may make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend to re-suspend the stock 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's increase.
To be more precise, the market over the past about 35 years has often been the most - about 14 percent - management's goal is to increase the company's rates in a relatively flat 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then return to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14 percent on the last six years.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and returns are starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help it.
At the moment, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could accelerate the recession.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, nominal annual GDP growth was only two times below 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect its maintenance, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question of "whether this time is different" could arise, Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared to grow the Fed throughout the year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since the 1950s, all of the accretion cycles so far have been in a super-cycle of lever-action accretion with GDP covering the peak of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and still continuing.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market expects interest rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the rise/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that raising interest rates will bring yields closer between long- and short-dated bonds, which will equalize the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though “we’re still careful about yield tension,” Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adjusted to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and a decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spread has widened, and volatility has risen — all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after interest rates rise and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse because a growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be higher.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in every increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
Savers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slammed the station for "deploring"
He claims to be increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He's also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says he's just cheating Brits.
MP Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims the frontman and amasss fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they're doing something commercial broadcasts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public service radio station appeared to be "stupid" and was increasingly unrecognizable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He has also been nominated for the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be the British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two examples that come to mind when you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's director general denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and making music is actually at the top of their game.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into service is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because the British are less educated when it comes to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire for trampling on business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George appear as judges - was produced "in a manner typical of the BBC".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it next launches a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' money on licensing fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000 alone.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for the slowdown in spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making ghost towns out of many of Britain’s main streets.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending in August was the lowest growth increase since the beginning of the 2000 survey, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data shows a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth over the past few years and go back to 2000, the state has always rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s revenue index editor.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore seems to be falling away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was adopted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases while collapsing several sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers renegotiate, can keep customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims bury the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 people were taken to the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose a path and paid homage to the victims when the first of the fallen arrived on his last journey to the cemeteries in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days before the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hajj will be held in Mecca and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane shoulder on top when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The agency’s English service did not report the details, but said the company’s executives had been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converge before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane and has not made available its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladi’s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and run large construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden was the son of an apostate who was abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the middle of a strong wind and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that must be completed at least once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) will be given to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European traders working for cheap are already making a trend
The British are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix trades focused on traders
Kingfisher Closes 60 B&Q Outlets Across the Country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be laying down hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed East European skilled craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing artisans to do tailoring work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain for domestic needs, argues that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders, and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "Most of the men are still working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions about buying goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of the FTSE100, also restructured her top team to reflect the equality between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that it has half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Ms Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
"It is justice for equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09, who stressed the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, the chairman of the ODS MPs, noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorization, because it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have room to find the mechanism by which we will arrange it," Stanyura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which next year it should be valued beyond the law.
Marx defended the grant by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
Higher valuations next year would mean a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every one hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Op<0xC3><0xA1>lka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction in real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto right-wing payoff in December will significantly complicate and perhaps even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD members Roman Sklen<0xC3><0xA1>k therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the norm in the committee to ten or 20 days, even blocking the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to go mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions are expected to rise by an average of about a hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be received by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their entitlement to a pension in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to ask for an additional fee in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued regularly until January, namely by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5% of gross salary, next year it should be 40.5%.
According to the state final account, the state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more annually.
Old-age pension expenditure accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension last year increased according to data in the state final account by 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned his plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire’s Senate seat was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was supposed to represent the Zapadorozhia Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling party United Russia, defended his post in Sunday's elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, senators do not elect citizens, but elect them from among the three candidates whose names they will announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, the senator from the three candidates will choose himself.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin, however, has found an exception for Yakunin, with the exception that he is an extraordinary and empowered ambassador, to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The last straw in the protagonist's determination is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urov<0xC3><0xA1> decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1> are on a similar journey.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the present, Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would fall to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Still, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was probably a well-rounded athlete.
Before filming, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode a bike, climbed the rocks and even walked up the hill.
And all this in record tropical weather, the director noted.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to make a rabbit out of it over time.
They'll pour him some food, but they'll close the door right away so he doesn't have to play outside the rabbit house for a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks it well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to roast her husband to death, Baigar said.
The film also depicts the fate of Jan’s married daughters Olinka and Alenka – T<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmov<0xC3><0xA1> and Pavla Beretov<0xC3><0xA1> – and the sons Erika and Pep<0xC3><0xAD>k – Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Havelka and Jakub Koh<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet company Google has promised to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charity of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of Teli<0xC4><0x87>'s visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the YES movement Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka postponed the planned Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, this is justified by last week’s EP resolution, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka was a co-author.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani party Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the possibility of talks with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by the <0xC4><0x8C>TK clarified.
The EP resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling by opposition Azerbaijani journalist Khadija Ismailova, who has campaigned to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out that in the future, the Russian air base in Syria will be established.
We don't have any plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus, which it has used as a service and logistics center.
According to reports from the Russian press, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weapons and military equipment to Syria has increased.
According to Moscow, this is an arms shipment resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to set up an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington does not have a clear understanding of Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, their third phone call in 10 days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow next week to express his concern over the gathering of Russian arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad’s support from Moscow a “lost bet.”
On the goals of Russia's policy in Syria, he said that they are rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its own satellite.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, it is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main theme of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York, according to Russian media speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a meeting of the United Nations.
However, opinions among White House advisers are still diverging.
TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin has not yet scheduled a meeting with Obama on his New York trip.
Put sesame oil in the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressed from seeds for cold, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, bile.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common causes of death for Czechs for several years.
Gastrointestinal inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you should not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
They are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder mainly concern overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to that of bile.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should pay attention to the goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all the active ingredients, said Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces organic virgin cold-pressed oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can grind 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial in diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamersk<0xC3><0xA1>’s research, which she led at Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it starts to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, to flavor salads and is especially suitable in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels the most.
In case of heart problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the amount of fat and calories taken in total.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
By storing in the refrigerator, the shelf life is even longer.
The old oil is known mainly by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no downtime due to the fault.
This is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are classified as so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and in the healing of wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not need to be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that in the company Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling.
It is sold annually for 500 litres.
People often take one tablespoon of it in the morning.
Hemp oil is not at all tasteful, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the karst company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most avid nation of barbecuers are Americans.
There is a 1.4 grill for one household.
All over the world there are various competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life did not grill.
The vast majority of them also grill several times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this, and at the same time, when grilling, it will leave a beneficial substance in the health?
In general, during the grilling process itself, you should save on fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their use when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, experts from the company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will be immediately equipped with grape oil.
It complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216°C.
Thus, even at such a high temperature, Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of this wine grape oil, describes the benefits of grape oil as one of the few oils that preserves the health of the beneficial substance.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
Furthermore, it contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - because it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when tasting salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
When grilling, you can use it in two ways: marinating and grilling.
By marinating the meat and fish, we keep them juicy.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, add apple cider vinegar to the acidity to soften the meat.
Spice, in turn, gives the meat a taste and preserves the oil and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare meals.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are a total taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil, thus avoiding the burning of food.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of attachments.
For grilled meat and fish, almost anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, Hot summer salad.
To make it you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a salad bowl, add the chopped arugula, chopped cucumbers and chopped peaches to the salad leaf mixture.
Salt and pepper to taste, you can also taste minced chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, sprinkle a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: It is not only about the medication, but also about the patient’s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only a matter of medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social legal advice, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc., are part of the care for these patients.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick frees up space for disease activity.
For example, regular movement has been shown to significantly delay the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why the website Give a Chance (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, there is a double rule that the sooner the disease is treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis at an inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will succeed in stopping the disease and delaying the disability, explains Dr. Eva Medov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often resolves the weakening of the lower extremities or imbalance.
We work with patients according to their individual needs: to maintain their condition, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martina K<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC3><0xA1>ri, the primary care physician of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"Endorphins also wash out during the exercise and one feels good after it," says Dr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We intervene directly in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called saved, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is to allow a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including work placement.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with occupational therapists, so that each person gets a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With such a sick soul, we have to follow someone, not try to take everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to finally conclude that even with a disability one can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinov<0xC3><0xA1> - Schubertov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, Airbuses would not have flown.
Aircraft manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can produce and process right away.
Yet, in addition to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for the shaping of composites, one can come across something as ordinary as apricot peckers.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of cotton candy, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are washed in the stack of ovens.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, general manager of the aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague Let<0xC5><0x88>any, the former Letov manufactures a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply the doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also allow passengers to enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest Airbus A380 transport aircraft.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
Perhaps the momentary keys let the company adjust twice a year.
If the yellow stickers do not have a control record, the Prague plant should explain what to auditors from Airbus or Boeing who drive regularly to see if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
Human senses, however, have not yet completely replaced advanced technology.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
You have to knock the nutters out by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer falling, they will know if the nut is already properly tapped.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can protrude from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
During the inspection, a trained touch comes to mind.
When the controller passes the finger through a series of rivets, it will know if someone is out of tolerance.
Until he takes the exact deflector in his hand.
Letov fed the program of the L-39 military training aircraft before 1989.
However, not a single one was made in 1991.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
At that time, it was merged with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
The talks with Boeing were not so happy.
“We were a small company that didn’t have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable deliveries,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained closed if Letov had not invited the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I spoke there about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, Dubsky said.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
In 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these big jobs on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of supply for twenty or thirty years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive status among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special manufacturing processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not be making any doors for airplanes.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated inspections it costs millions of crowns according to Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Manufacturing processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train staff, equip facilities and re-certify the entire process, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
Now, the company is finalizing a process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing cadmium harmful to human health.
They got the job from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll also check our lab.
They test a set of samples themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, approaching the Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> way in which customers control them.
Long-term exclusive contracts are a reward for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant, the production of embraers stands and falls today.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complicated for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean he can say anything at the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, stacks of manufactured pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to get into that price range.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are completed, is empty so far.
It is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo is being built behind the curtain.
The riveting will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend that is taking place in the aviation industry," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The sale has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3,278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Only a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete assembly of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
Before that, however, the company has to pass qualification tests, for example, for the assembly of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company, when it can process not only metal materials but also composites," says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> proudly.
However, Latecoere is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the Letov area, where it is located, there is no other place.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800 and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of the hundreds of new aircraft airlines order each year, they don’t have to worry about work.
Although she has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
Creditors gained a 37.4 percent share in the company with a capital increase of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has signed a new share of 222.9 million euros among existing shareholders.
In total, it raised capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
The average growth of orders is expected to be four percent per year until 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French media say Latecoere is finally able to breathe again after years on the heels.
The Czech race in Prague's Let<0xC5><0x88>any is important for the groups.
The Group's revenue is 16 per cent.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The MPs supported a larger share of the state's coal levies.
The change in the fees for mining of minerals is expected to bring to the state treasury by 427 million CZK more than in 2013.
According to the government, the municipality's budget revenues should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
The mining of brown coal cost the municipalities about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in payments from mining areas with a permit for mining to a thousand crowns per one hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that thanks to this, the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million crowns annually instead.
The amount of mining charges will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The compensation shall be newly calculated as the sum of the amount of the extracted ore and the rates for the individual types of ore.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the imposition of a fee by a government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek, this is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging interest on the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are only received by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will go to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same will apply to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects from the mining charges will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm the communities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayorov<0xC3><0xA1>) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the finance minister improves his budget," said David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, KS<0xC4><0x8C>M member Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned.
K<0xC3><0xA1>dner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted the law back to the government to be finalized.
The rationale is that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, since prices are contracted from more than 90 percent in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or thermal power plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in compensation by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, the Commission considers that the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is approved.
If coal is to be exploited beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek that the decision to break the threshold at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken already for social, national economic reasons as well as for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to Decide on Interest Rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event, because it’s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the interest rate normalization process," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy was doing pretty well, recovering by adding trillions of dollars to the national account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned the markets to be prepared for the increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a big chance against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a message saying he was "summer" in his first murder and that he wished he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at about 10 a.m.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send a policeman to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house that "will not annoy anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb that read, “I’m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she’s the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, the Dean of the University, said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr Lamb's head."
Despite Monday’s statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss’s romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was “no evidence” of a “love triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
19-year-old daughter O'Steen and Prentiss were "shocked" by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, according to the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would "not go to jail".
When police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the forest where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school’s website, Lamb earned a PhD in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
I'm sure all of these things take their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left the injury in tears and ruled him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused Héctor Moren's reckless 15-minute surgery when 20-year-old Shaw burst into PSV.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has a very hard time but plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group stage.
I think he will play this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian arbitrator was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw's account read: "Thanks to everyone for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat to PSV
The English defender will have the added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It was a very nasty injury.”
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention wasn't to hurt his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn’t see the surgery on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long for him to learn to remember it.
You can't be David Cameron.
When asked by a children's scheme provider to name a favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “Funny, moving, creative and with strong content, I loved reading this to my kids because there was always a picture or message behind it that I hadn’t seen before.”
Well, except that in the next paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story of the book according to the elevator from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree," he said.
As if that wasn’t suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads like a summary lift of the Lorax movie, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: “In the town of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is compressed, and the air is compressed.
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the story of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by the predatory, tree-stricken industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the titular Lorax, the shrunken, the mutilated creature.
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant PR task was given to a helper who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a piece.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England selected for this tour, I think it will be unlikely to repeat the 3-0 defeat they suffered last season in the test series.
I wouldn’t rule out winning guests either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up and also the collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents an attacking possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in the series experience and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a hard one for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood up against two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no questionnaires around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I’ve mentioned this before — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely one hundred percent, and that doesn’t surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batsman gets to prove himself is a hard nut.
Lyth was given seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton was given nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could complain about is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and he is a batsman, which I rate very positively.
He is the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen would start alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, was overstated and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and the big difference in that is not.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 Tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately managed three centuries and didn’t even look.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he attracted me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a stretcher, but there aren’t a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seem to have made a few changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a rich experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives in the white-ball section of the tour and brings to the team both energy and ruthless spark.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day break, as was Root’s similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron’s unintended renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets into further trouble with every passing day even without electing the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to head the Workers’ Party, or will the TUC take the whole situation to the forefront on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough of Britain's self-centred agendas, concessions-sharing and disruptive treaty changes that most did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they would not want to do so even if they were to absorb social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unbridled Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have gotten to the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also diminishing.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to see how they break their legs with the help of Selfie Britons who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning purposely unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 referendum in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing valuable from the negotiations."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how fierce Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are the press oligarch barons, because they were not in the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, the elusive Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based “EU straight bananas” reporter in the early 1990s.
Despite his shyness, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-exempt thugs, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo non-sea departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she won't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted to the principle of abrogated EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got him a discard card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he must not waste time on me anymore - seems to be in danger of re-adopting the Murdoch Neil Kinnock boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat at the BBC he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is, I'd say, moving forward.
He says he wants to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the crazy Ukip trend and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly step up to it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't commit to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's fight was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background of any sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me too - the discipline of the message remains important in the age of all-day television broadcasting and especially in the faith, the breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal that social media is all about.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the Labour Party’s support in the referendum campaign as self-evident, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s basic distortions of EU membership – consistent with their Bennite haunting economy, anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic squandering.
As with his twisting about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions from Britain, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Britain's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the Monday launch of something called the Security Forum of British Influence.
Experts criticize the review of electronic published by the agency Public Health England
A government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet’s critique of the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE published a “threshold” report last month and described it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An insider in the Lancet magazine last month attacked the "extremely shabby base" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claim, which was allegedly “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They suggest that the public might expect PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to elaborate a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly previously obtained funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not funding allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of e-cigarettes, some of which also declare industrial funding in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "excusefully admits," lacking "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a smoking route for children or non-smokers” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim at BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and the NHS costs <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not without risk, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" to hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other UK television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for putting in place public service programmes that would likely be watched by only a handful of people, in difficult broadcast times compared to its rivals' biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC is putting in and broadcasting programmes that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House's communications committee as part of the BBC's negotiations on the future.
If you keep licensing fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should cut back on making at least for programs that others don’t make or don’t make.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why the regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on home soil.
Honestly, the other channels would give the right hand for them.
I can't understand how these are public service broadcasters.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for catching up with the ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows repeats those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the prettier BBC public service programs "go over to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they're going on their hypocritical mission of justifying <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of revenue from licensing fees, "but of course they don't do it all."
They send them out at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission: "I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I would be surprised if they pay that much because they don’t watch that much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithove mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had already been classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% radio - and should take the example of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
Speaking about the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, where only a handful have been broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the beads are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that is able to control sound waves.
Small eardrums change direction when they are struck by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.

The scientists said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenesis, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the patient's brain to stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The flakes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when he places them in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Augmented ultrasound waves act in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the glands using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used ultrasound on such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons using light.
However, Chalasani made it known that sonogenesis could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
It's an advertisement that's crippling Britain's arms trade.
Take a look at Amnesty International’s Anti-Weapon Market video.
Horrible killer drones!
Chains on the legs that break the ankles!
Shredders!
And electric stunning slippers that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The full voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world’s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to the UK government’s willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes via defence and security equipment.

But a separate campaign is also being run with posters popping up at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using the letters of the London Underground with DLR lines becomes an image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR...Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen's key, which reportedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists within the protest movement and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade is the health of passengers in the metro.
The video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the gun trade ads - he saw an empty spot in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing around with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, I got more people hooked."
“They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torturing tools at the fair,” says Tom Davies at Amnesty International.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not being illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on the "shoulder launcher AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects beyond the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
The Eight Golden Rules for Life in College
Eleven years ago, I moved to college as an inattentive nineteen-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tensed smiles of those I had bothered — and the numerous, protracted complaints of others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the tracks can range from mild to nerve-wracking to totally hectic.
It’s tempting to tell people where you’re from, if you’ve taken a year off, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why “you honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because people, it’s just an extract from HAHA yeast, I’ll be at my house in peace.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find people you like and those you wouldn't be dealing with even if your eyelashes were in one fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Leave room for people.
People's rooms often change into a drinking reception, movie nights, and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress up and change their underwear.

Introverts will come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet lots of rails are turning into an outdoor walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture will allow you to say, “I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can return to the energy I used to talk to you.”
Try to find out when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
When it comes to knocking, knock.
One guy in my tracks used to say that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to college at the top of the baking mania, knocking on a foreign door and performing with a plate of baked pies seems slightly less strange, less so than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it will all end up putting your face in a delicious surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and starch are likely to interfere with others pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
Stealing a whole chicken is of course a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Double check with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they get angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who exchanged her milk for a means of washing dishes to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, but you’re also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet the drum and bass a little, because it was 3 in the morning and she had a typo.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally shut up at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then left her own music out loud, locked the door, and went to her three-hour song.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future were on the same track as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you misled your roommates for your future marriage, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends as well?
Of course, you won’t be heartbroken – but if your sexy roommate isn’t 100% your future sweetheart, try at least a little talking to your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it can be easily corrected.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never glue their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve had a rough time already during her pregnancy with today’s seven-year-old Vitek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise the offspring.
I coped with the situation fairly quickly - I was very much looking forward to the baby and was looking for a positive in it.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for a long time, recalls Eva today on her first pregnancy.
Already at that time she met on the Internet at the chat of an older Vask, with whom they began to talk about favorite movies.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and V<0xC3><0xAD>tek home from the maternity ward, but he did not take on the role of a stepfather.
"He then pulled out of the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in Volume 3.
The theme of the third series of the Czech television series is precisely the search for happiness on the second attempt.
She was able to take care of V<0xC3><0xAD>tka and her family’s financial security thanks to her part-time work and her mother’s and aunt’s great help.
In the end, even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not indicate Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around V<0xC3><0xAD>tk’s second birthday and he now understands Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka as his father and also addresses him that way.
Even though Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood in his 60s and is also more concerned with children.
In addition to V<0xC3><0xAD>tko, two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka and finally twins joined them.
"Yours came into our family so naturally, maybe because my mother never talked much to me in relationships," Eva says with a smile.
Little room?
At least we're close.
Twins Emma and Ela were born with an imperial incision after Eve was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess in the pregnant blood and are manifested in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth, usually spontaneously withdraws.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka's happiness, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Emi<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s niece works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from JIP to the room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors voted to release the babies, who meanwhile managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting to have children in Eve’s maternity ward was not a joy.
"I've been crazy about my husband and kids," recalls a four-time mother in the six-part division.
She and her husband also thought about signing a reverse, among other things, because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But that didn’t happen, and the doctors let Eva and the twins go home.
The stories of four pregnancies and childbirths are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
Quite a large family can be tamed.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with an electric double boiler and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food more comfortable for six people.
If it's the worst, we'll take a cab.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or numbness of the house.
So far, we've done too well, better than we expected.
The mess gets worse in a small space and we sometimes cross over the rolling baby, but at least we are all close, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek's work on the lighting of the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
Therefore, he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his sixties, according to his words, care for the finances of the family and children physically manages, but how long will it be so?
"I realize that due to our age difference, it will one day be me who will feed this family," Eva admits flatly when asked about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a suitor for an employer.
And when it's the worst, my husband and I can turn into a cab, a cute blonde jokes.
Apple has achieved the yo-yo effect.
Displays can do it all.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a more solid chassis or a touch-recognizing display are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend has been that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the disadvantage of the novelty was really negligible.
This is not the case with new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model, then by 20 grams for the larger one.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets has suffered greatly.
The new chassis is thus made of a more durable 7000 aluminum alloy, which also reflected on the weight.
But the displays have a much greater impact on it.
In fact, Apple has used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to which the displays distinguish the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to equip the display with another layer of capacitance sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, for a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component to use.
The weight of just 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the degreasing bark, which affected most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the battery is the most difficult element to use, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident just at the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As far as the new display technology is practical, it will only show up when used.
The first users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when sales of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Have the breadcrumbs been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have managed to find a place that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated to the time about 30 thousand years ago, but scientists have discovered something that is very similar to the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oat grains have been found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing such popular flakes today.
With it, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped of the packaging, the so-called dust, then burned and spilled on the surface.
In the Paglicci cave, it was possible to find a grain that was apparently heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least traces of use on two stones in the cave indicate this.
Thus, scientists could not prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that a complete process of production of flakes would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm, is of course offered quite logically.
At the same time, this is very interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals long before the beginning of agriculture.
If the interpretation of the flakes is correct, the oldest flakes have preceded agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports at the Brno City Transport Company.
So I listened once again to the report of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnus<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova, P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>zrak, Fr<0xC3><0xA1>zova, Sprateck<0xC3><0xA1>.
Of course, the trolleybus was a little louder, so the male voice reporting was a little less comprehensible than before when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better discernible than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that this speaker was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different than in the frame of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops, so I do not need this report, but foreigners from abroad, who do not confess in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can finally get out of the way.
Perhaps the choice of the speaker - but better again the speakers - should be made again, and this time colored by the usual traffic noise and the roar of the engine, in which the speaker's tingling in the bus is almost lost.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of the stations of Vodn<0xC3><0xAD> Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>rova, or Ponorn<0xC3><0xA1> in the shrinking country to which I moved in Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
I suppose my old-fashioned hearing didn't suddenly get so bad on the one day that the speaker of the stop changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the trail's notes.
Today, few people know what were the biggest and smartest governments of the party, the so-called comprehensive checks.
I allowed myself to remember that.
The bus was late.
I walked into the dispatcher's office the moment it sounded like it was seven o'clock on the radio.
"You're lucky you didn't make it with your comrade-in-chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in a good mood," the dispatcher remarked as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll take care of it.
Write to me that I'm going to the precincts for a minor mechanization review.
It's not gonna work. There's a check today.
They're all fucked up, to the point of horror.
What's this about?
'You'll see, 'said the dispatcher.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's office opened, and the chief appeared.
Stuck, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly turning on two buttons of the uniform jacket.
'Good morning, 'said the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, not realizing the cold, ominous tone to which the old man responded.
'You're playing, 'said engineer Eva, the older lady, whom I greatly appreciated.
She said she was even the chief before her colleagues took her down.
There's checks and you'll be there in a minute.
How many times have I asked what the complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they only live once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's quite unpleasant.
At least for some.
I think I'll see.
I pulled out a file with periodic reports and then the phone.
'This is Holcman, come to me now, 'said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we met and nothing..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I have come to your command," I said, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief sat at the desk, looking at a ladder.
'Comrade mechanic, 'he said after a moment, without lifting his head and still looking at it carefully, 'I don't like your behavior at all.'
He threw his left hand to the table, leaned against the back of his chair, and stared at me with a usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I've lost it.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy boasted that I had done a very good job during those few months in office and that he was very satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
And now this?
Realize you're a distance-tracking technician, and that's what you have to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I said that I had used such a greeting since I was a child, that I had been so educated, and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red rag on a turkey.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the embittered chief.
And besides, you're still messing with your boss's address.
One time you say "sir" and the other you say "comrade."
But I'm not a chief to you, I'm a fellow chief.
The deputies are comrades-in-arms, the master-trackmasters are comrades-in-arms-trackmasters!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, Mr.... Comrade Chief, but... but I've greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work, or a comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your advantage not to be on the side," said the chief, coldly, who had calmed down a little in the meantime.
But we will talk about it.
Anyway, remember that you don't have a pre-paid retirement chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a moment he was staring at me with a cold, prickly look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also disgusted by his lofty stuttering.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing god, actually a fellow god.
Zealous, puffed up, authoritarian, arrogant, as he was at the moment.
He's been kicked out by everyone.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all the party members, but also non-partisans, tugged at him.
But the chief taunted many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
Right now, he's got me all fucked up.
I thought about the ass and it cost me enough to beat him so I wouldn't shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't go back to the croupier's bar, let alone continue to be a railway official.
What would I use to have two kids?
And for that, an outbuilding!
I was in tears, but I managed.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
'That's all, you can go, 'said the chief to the audience, and began again to look carefully at the ladder he had previously held in his hand.
At twelve o'clock they called me.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in said, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because the comrade-in-chief would have to do the work himself with his faithful, and that he did not threaten.
The word "comrade" emphasized, as if he knew what the old man was doing to me this morning.
There was a nice meeting in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief, at his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who were to decide whether or not I should be an official.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k, president of ROH, staff writer, special-purpose referent, something to counter the way in the war, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the stretcher.
An ordinary railroad worker, he would beat the logs or throw gravel with forks.
But also a former bachar.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, said to be a nice beast.
Bad languages claimed that he graduated from school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the criminal was overturned, he ended up at the crook's.
But Comrade, yes, Comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little pacifier in me, an inscrutable chin in my throat.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k read the opinion of the Citizens' Committee from his place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, I have two children and so on and so forth.
So far it's good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then the verdict from the party's street organization.
He was copying the opinion of the Citizens' Committee, perhaps both were written by the same man.
But then it came!
The parents of long-time members of the party refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k noticed this and stopped reading.
The captain told me to keep going.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out on the side, the side gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the National Committee, I also had a wedding at the church.
I have disappointed the party in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I performed a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the framer finished reading, just a tap of the chief's pencil into the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I was able to fix the bends without any fucking checks.
But now?
She took the railway officer's career for her before she started.
Go back to the squad?
I don't think that's going to work out. I'm sure the chief will give me an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade discussed here?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the recruiter.
Well, according to a previous employment report.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, K<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k didn't do it twice.
On the edges of his sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he had been examined himself.
He nodded fervently and handed some paper to the chief.
'Well, 'said the chief, with a hint of joviality, but which was often a harbinger of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with distinction, studied industrial work, worked as a locksmith in the task force, fulfilled the norm on average at one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where'd you get that assessment, Comrade?" he turned again to the recruiter, who felt that it was starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a recruiter.
This is where my partner gave it to me on the way in.
Is that enough for you?
'Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to join the gang, 'said the blacksmith.
And there are no reviews required, his was kind of extra, so I put him in the file.
"So when you put this piece of paper into the technical function, you've had enough," the chief said dryly.
The cadre stared nervously and had no answer.
"It's okay, we'll talk about it later," the chief concluded, and the cadre seemed relieved.
For the time being, he stood.
"So what about you, Comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes went dark, I felt hot.
There was a flood of remorse and reproach, and I knew I was the most hideous creature in the world who did not deserve the least mercy.
That by instilling an incomplete judgment, I misled the co-rapporteur’s colleague, and I did not understand why the judgment was incomplete when I got it from a factory recruiter.
I am also an anti-socialist, who, at the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in religious darkness.
That, that, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I'll still do, and I quietly prayed for it to end.
I didn't give a shit.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took the potato.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people, as I was in the eyes of my comrade-in-chief.
'That would be enough, Comrade Chief, 'said the Chairman of the Party, abruptly interrupting the chief's Levites.
This is where a comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to shut the door on his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated bachelor spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is that how he read or parroted phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided fellow in his efforts to correct him!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
In fact, it is a party duty for all of us.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
As a kind mother, she not only punishes, but she also loves.
When the president was finished, no one even stopped.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the Chief of Staff snarled, trying to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd have heard I was headed for that conclusion.
They all shook their heads in agreement, but they could see that they did not believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the role of independent referent of basic care," I shrieked upon returning to the office, and then I cried.
Except for the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
The silence listened to my incoherent make-up of recent experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked me if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and prepared the pots.
In the meantime, there was talk of cadre practices.
How one judgment, often full of praise, give a man into the hand, and the other, in which there is some dirt, send it to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had to go, I ended up at the dumpster, so the colleagues at the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our dresser?
He just cares where he'd eat or drink, and so it ended up being how it ended up.
"He's got it from the old man," she said maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Look out for him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no one humanized.
Zero from a big-power dumpster.
The water for the coffee began to boil and the office was filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a cube of sugar into the pot and silently mixed a hot pot.
I guess I'm from the worst outside.
Now they won't fire me, and further checks are in three years' time.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I'm not going to forget that day.

The symbol of the village is alive.
The windmill over Chlum is turning again after years.
It is visible from a distance, because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high tower.
People from all over the world call him the "window on Chlum."
For the municipality of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal character, which the municipality acquired on the occasion of the meeting of relatives in 2010.
"At that time we asked for a sign and the fan we wanted to have on the sign, of course, everyone in the area knows it," said Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Plumbing Wind Pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a reminder of the present: it reminds of a time when local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries has been a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the flamboyant representatives decided on a solution that would suit them until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch to <0xC4><0x8C><0xC3><0xAD>chov had a well seven meters deep dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Kunc from Hranic in Moravia at a cost of CZK 2,400," reads the commemorative inscription on the ground-floor fence of the tower structure.
The pump after several repairs and the collapse of the wind turbine served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply line began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The Dominant was released at this year's meeting of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the windmill and put it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but had to be brought down the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the right material and the wheel could not resist the gusts of wind.
Then the chlum dominatrix rested for several years, dismembered under the roof.
However, since June this year, the bike has been spinning on a high mast again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the relatives, the village had the replica of the wheel modified and again placed it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws useful water from the well only into the assault blind arm.
And during the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
It was at least in vain.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind turbine from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the windmill has been awarded the municipal emblem, but it is the only one of its kind in the whole of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
They have a similar element in the sign in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> Hora in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, Partutovice in P<0xC5><0x99>erovsk or in the Police in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
Nothing wrong, but I do not know Lafat, the support of Tripolis Goian admitted.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at a pre-match press conference.
At the time, George Hagi was training us, it was a misfortune that we lost.
I hope I score a goal now, Sparta.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the invasions of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1> about the Greek battle.
He knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know well Fatai, who played in the Romanian Astria with my brother Lucian.
At that time I saw all their matches.
"I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta," Goian said.
He did not name other players of the Prague club, so the question came straight, whether he knows David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly scrutinized look, aimed at the Czech journalist.
The helpless expression on his face was, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of team.
He has really good players.
Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know about Goian very well.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such an organizer of the game," noted Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has the best years behind him, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.
At the time Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, were interested in him, but from Steaua he went to Italian Palermo, also playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European Cups, washing for the victory in the Czech League.
For me, he is a favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
"Like Sparta, we will try to win," Goian said.
I am at peace with Slovak goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is very happy with his Czech opponent.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the Group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague stock exchange."
Due to the entry on the Stock Exchange Prague, the company is completing a prospectus of the securities, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the registered office of the holding company and the related share transfers will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
As a result, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main news session of the Czech Television.
And how did she survive?
When journalists at the Faculty of Journalism teach about how the media can manipulate reality, they can launch today’s broadcast of the Czech Television Event.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the reporting.
Until the first minute, when the Czech Republic informed about the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers, they euphemistically called for patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already underway - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian Children in the Czech School - The Story of Integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Travel of refugees - <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
The most striking thing is that the <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses only images for small children and women in the illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic, 80% are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no resemblance to communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once roamed the pancake flat, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
My ponds were moving into the cardroom.
Fishes domesticated, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing that transformation from caterpillar to beetle and juvenile looks like an adult individual, is just tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to lose them.
First by hand and then by chemically.
The socialist drugstores provided some kind of blue crystals for their liquidation.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or any other way?
However, it has been successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box of some kind of juvenilizer that the ants brought to the nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration and I became more and more inclined to the view that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have taken the experience from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace the other.
The truth about fleas and puppies is that I probably wouldn't do anything to make karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don't climb over our necks, let them eat the shells of fallen skin, some invisible lashes, and so on.
Their peaceful existence over time was disrupted by a spider.
It was a common kind of carpenter who sat on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he was living off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which just increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on fish, and that his number seems to have remained in a bearable numerical state.
With a confidential regular contact with every need, we found out that it is a female.
After all, we have seen romantic connivance with a partner about a third smaller, how carefully it rubs on the fibers of the web, so that it is not eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move and they didn't even respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't even move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around it.
They'll be gone soon.
Some of them were eaten by their mother, some of them by other people.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that former toilet-keeper.
For some time from the ceiling, she watched our behavior carefully and, moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-attack as a friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fish decreased again, and the spider calmly watched its usual activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed in a year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, has reached an age when the use of the nightstand has already been a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already fed us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
But the daughter, in order to maintain her bad habit, found an excuse in that spider, which she saw very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, having luck in the house did not take at all.
Crying and screaming, she forced her nightgown.
It wasn't a big deal.
There came a time when the spider had to be ordered, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's all up to me.
It was caught in a glass and thrown over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but after such a long life, I felt as if I had thrown out a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric series.
It's a wonder, a week or two, that none of us showed up.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown them like ants, that the environment of the toilet is not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already crouching.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their attachment to the spider must have had a cause, that when they don't see it, that it's hidden somewhere else and that they're in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them caused some intimidating reaction.
I have no illusions about their eyesight.
There was some light of timidity, but that they would react to shaking hands or rapid movements, it was not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's already forgotten her nightgown.
All that remains is to attract another spider.
I'm sending my wishes to the aether now, and I hope they didn't lock me up after that execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
Albert Einstein’s Ten Sayings That Enriched the World.
The words of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to delve into everything so deeply that the outpouring was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He first and foremost introduced his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Nor can we forget his explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of popular theory of relativity is so intricate for many that they prefer easy adverbs for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
However, it would not have been Albert Einstein if he had not found an ingeniously simplified form of explanation for this: A clock near your beloved seems to be a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour – and that is relativity.
I allowed myself to choose from all of his pleiades of famous quotations the ten that literally caught my eye.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
The only one who can prove me wrong at any time.
It is a sad period, however, when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what they're going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV, they're going to be bricks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know much too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem on which my life depends, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I can’t forgive not putting Einstein’s formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is holding your tongue behind your teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Region are expecting changes of $1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them are kept in black numbers this whole year," said Governor Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>k.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
The share in this is mainly higher than the payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after a poor year, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
Thanks to this, Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n are leaning towards the buildings, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period of time, when we mainly bought the devices, ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them top-quality health care can not be done, justified the plans of the regional deputy for health care Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as.
They are looking forward to change in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospital next year.
In Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now collecting almost CZK 300 million.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> they have a planned addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to add a new internal for about 200 million to the central pavilion open this year.
And the Zlin Bata Hospital is waiting for the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internal one, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, this is a major and often major change in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the entire region, for patients and doctors," V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prouskov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the hospital, said, for example, about the construction of the Vvet<0xC3><0xAD>n internal hospital.
The five-storey building there is expected to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes that patients are particularly aware of will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, on the floor they only have one toilet, the beds are unrelatable, the windows are leaking and the health workers do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our hospital was built thirty-five years ago and now it is on the verge of life," said hospital director Pavel Calabek.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to new rooms.
The same model already has half finished Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
Central income is already standing and will be added to it in three years.
"We will pay for the building from credit and partly from our own funds," explained the director Petr Sl<0xC3><0xA1>dek.
It is precisely this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still the highest and it was not lost even two years ago, when, for example, the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajd<0xC3><0xA1>k, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients of the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> hospital are also improving.
In ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repair, new equipment and reconstruction.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance will begin.

No one has explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live in our country anyway.
"We didn't get an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meetings of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We don’t agree with mandatory quotas like a system that simply can’t work.
We cannot talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are heading somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine that.
We did not receive an answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, that is, registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We were dealing with forty thousand recently, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people on the ground?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to see us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country, have an ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this wave of migration, that is, from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't even want to come to us, but fifteen hundred people have already committed themselves to accepting.
Would it not be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, it's going to be 1,100 people that we're going to handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we've treated those we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will debate with Europe about whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that we will not keep even the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after arrival.
If we are able to detain them during the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then almost 98 percent of European statistics get international protection.
They will then receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move.
This is the second project that is currently under way, and we have only made progress there by debating with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them get jobs, housing and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that other countries were not willing to discuss the ministers' negotiations with us.
But isn’t it the case that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but doesn’t offer any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think a solidarity step should be?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can come to them, then the message is spread in a matter of hours across all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they just don’t want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Make it clear to them that they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, state agencies.
If we manage to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of economies, then the fifty percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day that Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where is it going to happen so that border controls can be tightened?
We were afraid of being caught by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returned to Austria in seven days.
We do it as standard.
The raccoons are the only ones who take these people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - it's a completely useless story.
So where's the breaking point?
Does it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two or three days in a row, exhaust our capacities enough to make crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to arise, the government could sit de facto immediately, and by a single resolution would decide to strengthen the police for the army, let’s call it the customs administration, or possibly the prison service.
An extreme variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get that far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
They are trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Football Slavia has paid her debts.
The footballers also got their money’s worth.
Football star Slavia stopped for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the proposal was submitted by Online Services of Pacific Samoa for around 20 million crowns.
The legal representative of Slavia Zuzana Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> tried to convince the judge Michaela Wenzlov<0xC3><0xA1> within a few hours that she should not declare a bankruptcy over Slavia.
I have to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B> became the new owner of Slavia.
Apparently, money arrived at the club from the new owners at the last minute.
This is also proved by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the top club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was settled between September 11th and September 15th," said Attorney General Slavia Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
To whom did Slavia pay?
Both current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivanov or the Czech backer Maria Lickova.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid the dues of the city district of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only claims that Slavie disputes remain de facto.
Either according to the club, the obligations have not arisen at all, or there are legal disputes about them.
However, we are prepared to pay in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove with a statement from the account," lawyer Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> told the judge.
"Anything that was due is settled," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that only invalid or conflicted commitments are outstanding.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the aforementioned debts.
All the evidence will then be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the proceedings to continue on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From the welding of structural steel to the welding of special alloys, as well as from the welding of rough materials to the welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
An incredible amount of welding curves, simple adjustment and expandability of the welding source allows you to react quickly to changing requirements, which leads to reduced downtime, the need to switch the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
Time is wasted and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty joints.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
This is a novelty that had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honors very much, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world's top.
For those interested, the delivery times are certainly pleasant, which range around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly expand after the Brno trade fair.
We have been its regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi store in Pilsen, for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built so that it wouldn't fall apart.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka was able to be found even more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that two landslides did not occur in Prague’s Stromovec, says the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said it on Wednesday evening during a news tour of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will be open on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and safety.
"The tunnel could be dug more safely, but the costs are increasing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovec were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to emerge with a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the soil collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
According to the original plan, the building would cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add to this the VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, out of seventeen billion you have twenty-one.
When technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, said B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, decrease in fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in year-round profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-sale trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, a 20 cent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which will manifest itself in January 4, and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company “showed strong performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade.”
The holiday rental plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire an additional 90,000 to 95,000 workers, which is about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks had expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx land unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues grew by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher base rates, while profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In early trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a fall of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether it is time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Standing above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable there.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to kick-start as it pulls out of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates on the ground since 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its benchmark rate of federal funds – by nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
“It’s clear that the labour market and inflation will be, first and foremost, the most important thing to watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not raise the level, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed were to raise rates, only if politicians softened the decline by promising that further increases would be unnoticeable.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was launched on the expectation that Fed policymakers would hold rates back this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates now," he said.
If the Fed’s policy makers did this, “they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so as not to panic.”
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects interest rates to rise this year through the spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of upswing.
And while inflation is still below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to slide late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record value in May, as investors worried that China’s slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May high.
The Fed’s political turmoil in the market provides a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
“In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
It now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the currency authority of the entire world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “suspend” their monetary expansion into the market has triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that the “Fed has a history of over-the-top movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy-making who pushed for rate increases, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions "despite limited identifiable growth impacts in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest wave is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets are getting angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter.
The store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The Market/Storage is the only point of contact that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the streets.
If you’re hungry for all that shopping, head out for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
In LAX-C you will probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits, and more.
The spread of meat is large, for example fish - employees behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-selling semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The wide streets are lined with shopping carts and high-lift trucks.
Finding: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinese district and center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House passed an amendment to the Senate that rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Land Communications Act will now go to the President.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said at the end of April that the law allowing a speed of 70 kilometers would veto.
Minister of Transport Dan <0xC5><0xBD>ok (yes) also opposed the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built at this speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be used to drive in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also excluded from the amendment the authorization of the transport police to have the last word in the regulation of local communications, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also expects that sewerage, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally below the surface of the carriageways.
This would save the community money to buy land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment also aims to help improve road safety and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles that owners do not report to.
The new municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which their owners do not register within six months after the notification of the towing.
Municipalities will have the opportunity to exclude transit freight transport across their territory on the roads of second and third classes under the threat of fines even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also removes the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of existing paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC4><0x9B>k<0xC3><0xBD> expressor is going to court.
He's in danger of 10 years of overcrowding for his fellow citizens.
The case relates to the alleged over-the-top project Greeting of Fellows.
The police wanted to prosecute Zuzana Kailov<0xC3><0xA1> (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The main event is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mac<0xC3><0xAD>k caused damage to at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert judgment.
Former members of the city’s leadership, according to the applicant, made it unlawful to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k ordered the then head of the municipal department of urban services, education and culture, to address five connected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to the administrator and only Darothore company entered the competition, which then the city council awarded the contract.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges, aimed at ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public contract to organize a welcoming citizens’ event in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem in the long term and acted in a coordinated manner at least contrary to the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper manager.
At the same time, he said, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently charge <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome of Citizens event, which would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the project file, the company collected more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k has previously denied any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership had only followed a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, on the same money," Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k added.
Criminals originally wanted to accuse MP Kailova, who was also a member of the city council.
The Chamber of Deputies did not release her for prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect Kail to be charged after her parliamentary term ends.
The reception of the compatriots was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers were given a gift check for 5 thousand crowns to buy children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly released the dog to a refugee.
Then the journalists were forced to delete the record.
Hungarian police say they briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to erase a record where a police dog allegedly crashed into the refugee’s country.
The Hungarian government, however, disputes this allegation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian town of R<0xC3><0xB6>szke crossing the border with Serbia.
The police stepped up against the refugees, and one of them had a Syrian attacked the dog with a basket on a sledgehammer.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was noticed by one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Muzi's officers took him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt like he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
The behavior of the police officers in it was unacceptable, saying that journalists should be able to cover the events without risking physical violence and not have to fear that the government will destroy legally obtained material.
Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs questioned Muzi's account of the events with reference to the police report.
He said police officers just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some of the shots, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, nothing forced him to delete it.
“Dogs can bark — they’re trained to scare off and kind of instill fear, but they certainly didn’t attack,” says Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
Unpredictable League of Champions.
Winning at City kicks us out, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, a home-town coach.
“We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Not a single team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on the kicks for longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," Pellegrini, whose team cashed in the match after a long 636 minutes, said.
The finalist of last season's Juventus was the exact opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, the defending champion has only a point and the score of 2:4 is only at the 16th place of the table.
Even so, the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester she represented Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to it we will find a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"In front of our goal, we could have scored 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," Allegri coach Buffon said.
"We've burned down a few good chances," Yayu Touré, City's backer, said.
We have to take away from the Champions League experience and try for a better result next time.
Farewell Angelo, Farewell to Old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media shaking around is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children who carry their parents on their hands on dusty exodus routes.
And this creates in a person - that is, in a European person - automatically a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice the pictures of the boats landing on the Greek islands that the baby is not so much visible on them!
Well, somehow, recently, images of ships heading for Lampedusa, refugees from the French border at Menton, have disappeared from our television, with thousands of young men lying by its beautiful promenades.
Mostly young blacks.
Also missing are the pictures of Callais, where these men are eating, and the black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's interested anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not in any way make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much of a falsity.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it somehow hides that it is not just about unhappy children from Syria, but also about decorated - for the elderly: fashionably decorated - young men.
Their musculatures look like they just came out of some fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer in Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And there came out of them young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all of them dressed in branded clothes and shoes, in their hands, like smartphones.
The fact that it was a private beach was of no interest, and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the couches.
Those who did not lie on it and were right in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed like they were from an American rapper film.
On the head of the hat with a fingernail, white and colored sneakers on the legs.
Then they laid siege to the local beach bar and began to feast.
They occupied the tables around, crowded next to the bar’s seated brown and white guests – reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming niggers drank beer straight out of a third - how in the series from the USA?! - threw empty bottles around the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, screaming and screaming in the water, mothers and children and pensioners fled in horror, and in half an hour there was no longer a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
It doesn’t matter if you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
'Well, they certainly didn't have it from work, 'said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had on his neck about twenty-centimetres of solid gold cross.
Women were like gold.
"They're drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them booze," said the waiter.
The drugs don't work, they don't use.
They're sneaking up on something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important to me yet.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known this first.
They don't seem to know.
At that time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, the main problem facing the European Union has been that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, like intellectuals and associated lobbying and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - today Europe's already publicly recognised main force - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the EU's and television's tops, including ours.
For example, the recent television pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the pictures of Moscow television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few tanners at the station, but mainly - the old-Germans - the Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For many weeks they have been talking on Czech television about how, according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But anyone who's been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
This confirms further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, a week ago more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
This was also reported by our television.
However, they kept secret what broke in Germany the next day: that in a poll on the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the polls were attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago, that "our effort to 'multi-culti' society has totally failed."
She added: “Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.”
"All attempts at such a cohabitation have failed utterly."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, the strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating with each other has not proven itself. Today they live here with us and we have been lying for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we say we just live happily side by side, has failed.
Totally failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
The Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, a Member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a degree in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play the supervisor in the concentration camp from the minute he was there - has shown himself several times.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has exceeded Rubik’s cube.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past as the aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Great Germans to control the whole of Central Europe?
When did he say that the Great German Idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was decommissioned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars, costing millions of lives, probably came back in a different form.
After an attempt by the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunny.
The German elites had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, thus leaving all the anti-atom fighters, enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan “Our forest must live”.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who everywhere in the world want to do something different and better, they have fully sided with the fighters against warming the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that there is also a strong anti-Semitic – so-called pro-Palestinian – and anti-Slavic current in this stream, which considers all Slavs to be difficult verbiage – since the time of Karl Marx, who, according to the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as recent statements by Schulz and German minsters openly threatening disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be listened to without apprehension.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we mix in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, capital, especially German capital, is behind it, because Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-belief of the tanners first introduced the Germans to the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it has brought home to them and still brings perhaps millions of Muslims.
Which, lured by the voices of sirens, will soon come across a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and they will start to storm.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, again a part of its inhabitants - but apparently a smaller part - can be ideologically disillusioned, but in the end reality as always will catch up with it.
Is Germany going to burn again?
Muslim homes are on fire.
What will the German government do when German public protests against the incoming Islamists erupt?
Will the Muslims who have been living in Germany for a long time come to the rescue, but certainly not the assimilated ones, so as to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, fearfully follow the Islamization of their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when the people rise up who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has arisen in Europe with the support of the solar ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elitist and, in principle, totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unrelenting treatment of disobedient democratic Germans and all the subservient and disobedient Eastern neighbours, they cannot do well.

Red-breasted Woodpecker (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which although it belongs to the expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's unexplored, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easily adaptable, modest and undemanding.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and photographing it further.
Underneath the vantage point is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with violet accompaniment.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diet
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the knowledge about the importance of good nutrition in breastfeeding using images of children soaring from the breast painted by the depiction of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, it is recommended for pregnant women and new mothers to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic’s and Lisa Wilkinson’s escape to Canberra to cover the costs of the Liberal leadership’s escape failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The morning show, Nine, was screened from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn’t seem to matter so much to Aussie TV viewers, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of Today’s broadcast.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in recent months, fills the gap on Sunrise.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than just parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has an average of very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a television hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result says a clear "yes."
The X Factor from Seven left a strong 1,136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed second-night hits on The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new TV quiz (from 5:00 to 5:30 p.m.) had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half had an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Due to a drop in The Chase Australia ratings from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy – but who does he choose?
Secrets Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is shrouded in an unfathomable mystery.
And the three girls who remain standing will definitely not reveal who the real one is who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they told us mercilessly who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his tongue behind his teeth until Thursday's finale
All three women lyrically chanted why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler for who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one who would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy relationship since one day.
“From the moment I walked into the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think about it during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
Together they are good and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a great couple with Sam Wood.
She claims that during her last visits to her home, she realized that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if he didn't eat her, and she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's definitely between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 am on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams questioned about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by an Australian rugby league convert in the first kick-off of Tuesday's 20:3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to get back in the game after being injured by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and just take care of the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for during his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught jumping when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn’t have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when recording in his own goal territory led to the Queensland trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested on the Siberian Ranvey.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
<0xC3><0x9A>S opposed emigrants who sought compensation for their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state with a claim for compensation under the law on out-of-court rehabilitation.
The Court first awarded them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90,000, with reference to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants stood up to the Supreme Court and slapped them with the amount originally charged.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, however, turned to the <0xC3><0x9A>S with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - even if it was adequate in relation to the detached property - today only reaches a fractional amount of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of secondary participants, such as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to receive compensation before," said judge Jaroslav Fenyk, who explained why the <0xC3><0x9A>S stood on the side of emigrants.
"The Supreme Court has repeatedly called for the general courts to proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of the restitution legislation, i.e. the compensation of property damage caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved."
Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> will now perform in the musical Studio DVA.
By the way, Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> became the youngest Evita in the world when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Per<0xC3><0xB3>nov<0xC3><0xA1> in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague.
To return to the same role, he says: "Today, the demands of Evita have not been matched by the performance power."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolon recommended her for the role of first lady of Argentina.
I have seen Moncho three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly, I saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is just particularly well-rounded.
"The direction of Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokola is original, light and contemporary," says Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The musical sceptre will be handed over between the two singers at the Monika Absolonov<0xC3><0xA1>’s Birthday Concert on September 27th at 7 pm at Studio DVA.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Silence your cry, Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also step away from the directing desk when he will be acting as President Per<0xC3><0xB3>n during the filming of Karl Roden’s film.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech studio of the world musical Evita presents Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been a success since February 2015.
Directed by Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokola, the main female role was originally created by Monika Absolonov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Along with her, Karel Roden appears as President Per<0xC3><0xB3>n and in the role of Che Peter Stren<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ik.
Legendary songs from the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber workshop with Czech lyrics by Michael Prost<0xC4><0x9B>jovsk<0xC3><0xBD> sound in the presentation of a live orchestra under the direction of Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof Mark, who participated in the first performance in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against a proposed new state constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired it into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high death toll.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and has mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in West Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted this week on a draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice master Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov you did not even manage a home duel with hockey players Sparta (3:5).

Cheers, folks.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to cause a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system somewhere in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles is also 60 percent likely to form a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, Miami-based weather forecasters added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European states fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries. Each of Google’s selected amounts
Google has announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted a report on her blog based on personal experience when she ran away from Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening migrant crisis in Europe is making more and more families, like her, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among four non-profit organizations assisting refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
According to Google, all contributions made through the website google.com/refugeerelief will double to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, ravaged by a four-year war that this year alone has driven out 4 million people.
Many people are also fleeing the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are provided with nonsurgical treatment.
“Death rates take a long time to figure out,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery who wrote an introduction to the new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery are used to reduce the stomach by various methods.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was done on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person’s overweight and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to a study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not provided with surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and partially only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol was shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflects the body’s ongoing blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, researchers say.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treatment group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — which is reflected in better A1c hemoglobin levels — did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of surgery.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to prolongation of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, it is a calming result for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone further claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes, which firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to grasp all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the present circumstances the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also spoke about the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the violent response of the United States has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a high-alcohol sanitizer, according to a toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of children under the age of 12 who were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children get these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the sanitizer intentionally, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking a sanitary product due to a cheap habit.
Teenagers reportedly mixed a sanitizer with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot more attractive (sanitary means) are those that are perfumed.
At the disposal are sanitary products with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several elbows can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxicology control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 station in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just let a bottle of whiskey spill, either, but people keep these sanitary products outside and when kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed up to four elbows of a strawberry-scented sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is double the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell down and hit her head over alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitary means to be out of reach of children.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some sanitary products were associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitizer containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medical professionals believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their “bad” teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary means and prohibited their presence in the room.
The police considered the foiled plan as "innocent gossip," and referred to the school district's discipline,
F<0xC3><0xA1>ma: No inconsistencies in Celtic
Griffiths downplays the talk of dissent in Celtic, while Delia admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it back on.
Hearts will fight with the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty by ADAMA Rooney ensured Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving Dons a five-point lead between them and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of inconsistency
This situation has sparked rumors of disagreement in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
“I don’t think we feel pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers back and former Netherlands national Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic – because there is no longer any rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "They no longer show the best of Celtic's matches in the Netherlands, and why?"
'Cause there's no Rangers anymore.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the old company.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension at Old Company matches and it’s not just people from Scotland watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic is a bit of a prankster, but the Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to the good.
Malm’s defeat and subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has gone through a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current events.
We're all the same, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago that suggested he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton has concerns about a large buyout of reinforcements and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss says, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.”
Players who arrive in the summer have the entire pre-season to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celticu Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, suggested he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old gunman has been having trouble with his prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Sk<0xC3><0xA1>cel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a threatened moment," the attacker said, continuing: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it's in Celtic's jersey."
The Council of Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team – but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for 'ugly win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold on desperately against the Hamilton Accies to get a seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, whether it’s cups or leagues, without winning this type of game.”
Scotland's unemployment rate remains unchanged as UK's overall unemployment rises
IMPACT in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UK’s (5.5 per cent), data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, the number of workers now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State David Mundell said: “The long-term government plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market, and Scottish employment has been rising while unemployment has been falling.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll be watching the man's execution.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison Death Chamber and see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws to a close, I begin to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole death penalty story.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution unobtrusively.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and I’ve made a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I’ll just have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have phrased it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the death penalty proceedings.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
For more information on the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I have created.
I will not repeat all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would have made him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will be watching his death.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
For this purpose, you can contact another journalist.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die a useless death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after freeing the men from the Canning River.
A bet by a man from Petru that he was fleeing the police did not come out after he got into shallow muddy water only meters from a policeman, who tried to persuade him non-violently to return to the shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in an incident that crossed into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and that police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
The football champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove a car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says organisers have tried to spy on him and are threatening to end the race
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin's positive cobalt discharge, which he can't explain.
He had been biting his tongue about the espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
“I didn’t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you all at once,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home today and get some sleep.
I want to go head-to-head and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about things that are being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they've totally burned out.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moody, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside of the coaching position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need me to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will provide them with material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will press them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratching in it has sparked the feeling that he could "watch his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on race day “ridiculous” after horses were put on their feet with an aluminum lining or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the plaques on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram's driver, who escaped, was arrested.
Police arrested a man who over the weekend hit a cyclist in Cobram and left after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping and helped the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Returns to Rivals Over Wrestling Claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' actions as "setting the plan" for two NRL favourites in the premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm team's controversial victory in the Sydney qualifiers on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark to Strorm after his team won the final qualifiers over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "supervision" of the rugby league and said two of the Queenslanders were not "too big."
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that the situation has increased his confidence because his team is criticized by two top coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, in the last few weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during operations, and that has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care at all.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game, which he finds exciting, especially his young backers with their speed.
You would like to play such a football if you had this type of players available.
He said this in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they’re afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that in the game Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the game Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn't watch it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring attempts that interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday evening at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing possible life for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland was given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from a Solay yacht that arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with the accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possessing commercial-grade cocaine, lawyer Maksimovice has built a defense that there is no evidence that he would own the entire amount and that he could have been in a cafe entirely by accident and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would escape.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
His mother and stepfather Maksimovice jointly offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, because the accused did not get further to court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily, and will abide by the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then signed up for her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found that she was missing her phone and then found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytic computers found the address and discovered a "worrying" search on the site using terms to search for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then told police that his reason was to “introduce pedophiles” online before “pretending to be a police officer and scaring them off.”
Tax attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was a dependency — that he was dependent on people’s fear.
He admitted that he was doing a computer search, but said he only pretended to be a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
He did it to attract them.
He claims he jumped into his drunken binge and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shook and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to accepting or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, breached bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was "no fundamental sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentencing to October for filing a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing other pending cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainted by opposition lawmakers' claims that they received anonymous threats of killing, which warned them of Mr. Mugabe's ouster during his speech.
Last month he was whipped and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to block Mr Mugabe’s speech.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear but is called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns concerned members to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "obligations" regarding threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolished 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services to the enterprise.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the PC and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive, sustainable-expenditure structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will be the head of the division.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and “will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to manage the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a highly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still September and if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason for him not to play at Christmas again.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is obviously uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after injury to the ankle and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This type of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger says.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern here.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only in 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get away with it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it does, and he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal start their campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debucha and Arteta are likely to enter.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal's Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to progress from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also undefeated in a total of 41 games after maintaining an "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
This was already the case in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and he has no hope of leading the club to their first European Cup win.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
This has never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar images in various shows is eye-popping, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever before in terms of suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men, which aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of mental problems.
But for friendship to work, it must, of course, first be attainable.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are actually more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game creator recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s frequent vics, a moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in a man’s friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close, a network of friends and family.
So if you’re going to the Comedy Central FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone at Starbucks alone, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - as many as 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG throw Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after shooting a goal at Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Sweden's Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is a report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 win against Malm at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions to victory, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are focused not only on qualifying for the elimination rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarter-finals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 seasons.
But even though they scored three points, it wasn't the classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted in front of the goal and was later substituted against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the Champions League it's not easy to win outside or at home, so a 2-0 win makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we'll have to improve over the course of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic came back after being injured as one of three changes to the PSG team, which held a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at home this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing has been labelled as a man who takes PSG in Europe to a new level after a move from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran over Marc Verratti's pass to defend Malm, he sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick off a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and got to this stage, advanced with 9 internationals in the base line-up and five defenders and two intercepted backers were a heavy opponent.
But apart from the shot of Nikola Djurdjica, who just passed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, not much was offered in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad shots and a poor finish, which was not good either from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half.
However, he proved to be much more suitable when it came to preparing a chance for his team-mates and it was from his innings that Di Maria sent a rotating shot that ended up in the Wiland Range after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent the sixth goal of this season behind the line after Ibrahimovic scored it after receiving it from Maxwell's left wing.
This put an end to all Malma’s thoughts about the possibility that they could make a profit from the match, and only Wiland’s excellent approach to the match put David Luiz’s hopes at a great distance, and the score remained unchanged even when Ezequiel Lavezzi’s goal was not at the end of the round.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last Champions League game took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a fascinating match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a slump in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion from stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt-reducing plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a slump in commodity prices as China’s slowing economy reduces demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore stock prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion share sale is part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold the new stock at a price of 123 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of China’s growth slowdown have cut the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed that Washington has visited Xi Jinping.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China relations and calls for cooperation in addressing issues of international, regional and common interest, and an opportunity for constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the September UN session.
Obama and Xi are expected to address disputed issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberespionage and its growing aggressiveness in the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis ravaged the Schengen area.
The emergency lightbulbs fired by Germany did not harden the European crew, but they are forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the refugee problem: it would rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it entered the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing about the future division of refugees by quotas, which has increased in number.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the EU’s 28 countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the member states have changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are already arriving today and to solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the text, which was negotiated by ministers in Brussels on Monday, said.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its determination and increasing the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
It has already served as evidence that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
It is a domino effect, but it can also be seen by the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re discussed this intensively during a private meeting with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented with a firmness.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, because it fears more than others that there will be no camps left on its shoulders where refugees would accumulate on its account.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as many as it has arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after having been through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of joint concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The Juncker Commission has promised to set up checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given a number or a date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European border control agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"There will be a need for adequate financial resources," the text submitted to the ministers for approval warns.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting closer to it.
The new emergency situation of the 27-year-old put the question of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees in second place, which was already set up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves redistributing 40,000 refugees over the next two years, an agreement already reached in June during the hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven people died under the avalanche in the Alps, including three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also the woman who survived as the only one of the affected group of eight members.
Previous media reports said it was about the Pole.
About thirty-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury in the area of the femur.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims have also been transferred to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident took place around noon in the Pelvoux mountain region under the top of the D<0xC3><0xB4>me de Neige des Ecrins mountain measuring 4015 meters.
"The abrupt avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
Today, the meteorological service did not warn the area against bad weather.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Brago: Finally the real Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, during his debut in the Cups, was able to go through the preliminaries of the European League to the basic group with the players from Liberec and is now looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan at the start of the main phase of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Braga and according to the coach wants to impose her playing style.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every collected goal, we can play our tactics and we’re not bound by just a duel.
"I'm very much looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Bragu is considered a top team.
It will be very active, have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players themselves, who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult because he does not have such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his squad, who I guess gave Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the level of top teams," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
He does not consider Braga to be a clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we showed in the home competition and in the pre-season that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels this season only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can also impose Braze's style.
A team that will be strong on the ball is waiting for us, at the same time it is untypically disciplined for them.
They play from the 4-4-2 position with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players perform on the pitch," said Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
In the pre-season we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we adapted the training.
"And we definitely want to, even though it will be very challenging to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films will dominate Sand, international festival begins.
This year, more than 350 authors from 51 countries entered the competition for the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Four dozen of them, which the commission composed of students and educators sent to the final, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the cinema Porty<0xC4><0x8D>.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t.
Every year the festival has its own special theme, which is derived from the festival soundtrack.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year’s festive evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatrical creation in them.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our journey this year," Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be judged by an international jury, which will include last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying program.
Comes Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbo<0xC5><0xA1>ansonov<0xC3><0xA1> band Letem<0xC3><0xAD>?, play band Zrn<0xC3><0xAD> or for example Petra Hapkov<0xC3><0xA1> with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first one will be brought by Jana Ashenebrenner, a graduate of the Sand Film School and holder of prestigious awards, including World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will bring closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin <0xC4><0x8C>ech, silent film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the song-bearers Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach will baptize their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the patron of FAMO in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop common bonds and film craft,” the spokesman said.
The Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, take part in several job competitions at the same time and thus gain a job position, will certainly help.
The festival is associated with the establishment of a private higher professional film school in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Its founders, the spouses of Vladan and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>ov, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the event of the bankruptcy of CK, the insurance companies have to pay the claims of the clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday when it approved a revised amendment to the Law on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee, according to a draft that is intended to be submitted to the Senate for consideration.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development is in the process of adjusting, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel agency insurance against the crash when the amendment comes into force.
The proposal has also been criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will have to either quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> (for YES) pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not euro-compliant.
She drew attention to this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
The insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it can be implemented," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one gives it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The member of the presidency of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouskov’s concerns based on a survey among the members of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The statements of the insurers do not consider Okamura to be relevant, according to him there is no official written statement in this sense.
But they are trying to find out if the travel agencies will participate, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competitive Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the removal of stairs by Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her motion to dismiss the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) did not come forward with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip has pointed to travel agencies, which he said could pose a threat to consumers.
The rapporteur of the motion, Martina Berdychov<0xC3><0xA1> (ANO), in view of the Constitutional Court’s verdict, withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurers in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not originally propose a minimum four million insurance limit for travel agencies that offer air travel, and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of insurance coverage will have to be such that, in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, it covers all claims of customers.
The standard, even after the changes, stipulates that travel agencies will have to re-indicate which travel agency organizes the trip for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Committee on Public Administration also envisages further regular information to the insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and trips sold, the total price of trips sold, and the amount of advances and sales for trips and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of the legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will ask the insurance company according to the proposal for correction or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
The amendment is also intended to restructure the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which it will always submit by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial spending plan and a forecast for the next two years.
According to the association, the drafter of the law did not think about the situation, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize the trip and clients who bought the trip before the insurance was cancelled, so according to the association they will lose it.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even collapse, even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will only act as agencies in our market, said the vice-president of the association Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains an institute of bank guarantee, but so unthinkingly that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Over the next two years, the whole law will need to be recast in the light of the new EU directive.
There are now a total of 942 active insured travel agencies operating in the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have finished their work.
The domestic travel agencies sell trips worth approximately CZK 20 billion per year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German prime ministers.
At the same time, it called again for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the Member States of the twenty-eight.
We need to do more to help countries where refugees are leaving or where they are staying after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will set up decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could also be greater financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the Prime Minister of Braniborsk Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favour of speeding up asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees is used precisely to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
It will take more teachers for refugees to master German.
This is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's HBO episode of the Greenlight project, the actor cast in the Brown series interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie, not by casting a show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted incredulously and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as comments about the Martian got aired.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the start.
The only black character that's a hooker is a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut that their director "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
A Twitter user, MrPooni, expressed anger at the writing of the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black person in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took a national hit and pushed law-makers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made notes on the movement, while listing nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement introduced a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the executive said.
Damon was recently listed as an entertainer, producer, and media mogul who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met with the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner."
Professional mountaineer Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men broke through to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30 second climb over a 220 m long rope.
Britten finished the climb first in the set limit and became the first contestant in the American Ninja Warrior to cross the 4th section, however, Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for E! News immediately after his hard-fought win and was aware that he was still in shock from winning the top prize worth $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finale and why Britten won't get any awards despite becoming the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishes the track the fastest.
"If more competitors take part in the race, the winner will be the one with the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd have any resentment in him.
He's glad he's been able to do what he's done.
He received a warm reception from his fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.”
Geoff said to me, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk through the pink garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are currently ranked last in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers narrowly overturned their defeat when they defeated Minnesota 5-4 in Tuesday's game at Target Field.
The twins missed the chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how you win,” Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers forward Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive lead and Detroit scored three times in the first two exchanges and then took another in the sixth and ninth exchanges.
Simon (13-9) allowed opponents 6 1/3 shots and 3 runs.
It was his third straight game of the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re sitting on the bench a lot and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tigers batsman Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 runs and his first point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last June game, in which he met four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
'He leaned hard on it, 'said Ausmus.
"He looked good in practice, fired noticeably better and managed to get it into the game."
With three laps at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the exchange thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The right-hander Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to a set bat and Simon shot Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent Mauer, and ahead of him was batsman Miguel San, who fired the ball and rounded two goals, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on goal and a shot at the draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third goal over two goals.
Plouffe has already scored 27 runs over two goals this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit retained the ninth shift, Mauer earned two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander ruled out Sana for three strokes.
Detroit took advantage and earned points in the Phil Hughes game.
The Tigers won three runs in the first two innings against a retired right-hander who entered the game after more than a month's hiatus due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," said Hughes, "but during the third shift I already felt that I was better at pitching."
After resisting a push in the first shift, Hughes dropped one point to second goalie Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right-hander J.D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who was the first to round all the goals.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 series.
The third goalkeeper Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another lap, but Victor Martinez was overtaken when he tried to reach the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second shift, when pitcher James McCann and poleman Anthony Gose scored two and then one point, and the score was 3-0 on the scoreboard.
"That got us on our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the toss, finished third with no points and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three goals, got six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed Tiger pitcher, ended the game with a pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is expected to enter the game on Wednesday.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-back Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and take on the Twins.
As of June 30, when Norris was traded for left-handed David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a strained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game together at Target Field on Wednesday.
Minnesota left fielder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will face Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is to reform management on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said, referring to the 16th meeting of the central leadership group for deepening overall reform.
The promotion of openness in the face of emerging reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative regulatory list of market access, the release of border control policies, State Enterprise Support (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and make sure that companies themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also states that China will enable border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, new bed compartments may be created.
According to Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub P<0xC3><0xA1>nik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgery centers could be established, where, according to the set concept, the performance of surgical branches, which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours, would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals the workplaces focused on day-to-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
At the skin department of Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apple center that would take care of patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, is the beds of subsequent care, especially the beds of the long-term ill (LDN), the capacity of which in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the beds of subsequent care are mainly missing in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
Abandoned buildings could be used there after centralisation.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are lacking throughout the republic, so it could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's center.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-on beds, on which the funds of European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the branches of specialized care and will provide space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, after heart surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
