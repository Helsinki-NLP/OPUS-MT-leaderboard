What is going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the city hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier in order to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues of the SDO.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in recent years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the newly elected do not quite understand the terms known.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
“I really don’t know.”
"I am a youth in Prague politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the chosen one to culture at the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather".
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression among those you propose to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the argot.
From the vocabulary, whose daily newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the SDO, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the bakery, "beef nerve", "treasure of the capital" and "intoxicate".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the four-member Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised an interview first but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I'm currently working on how we're going to understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says, and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspapers."
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the bakery".
“It’s about, I think, going into a company,” Plachy is willing to guess that it’s the headquarters of Janousek’s companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary that he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no lexicon of argot in social democracy.
“I have consulted with colleagues and it seems that we really don’t have something like this.”
“We call ourselves names, sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,” said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Karel Brezina admits about the nicknames.
The daily newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little Old Man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones the Social Democrats admit to using inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Batter Law" recalls it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor of Law JUDr. at the Police Academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of “witches,” a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women who are declared witches have commonalities.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this destiny."
“Young women are also not judged to be in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic."
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” the newspaper Die Standard warned about the drawback of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC's server that transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual ointments ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil flared up, it seems, when the team wanted to “hunt the bad spirit” of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human spirit eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia has seen the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
"President Dzammi of Gambia, after the death of his aunt, launched a large-scale witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have endeavored by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, randomly chosen men and women in the villages of the Gambia," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two of the prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The poles are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man walked out the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," shows finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One says this, the other says something else" by frowning at the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You do not have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a brief moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - repair requests, insurance events and more.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been collecting mail with the new leases in their mailbox since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
“It’s been running for almost a week, so it’s still in the test,” she replies, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents herself as a journalist.
The derangement and former Bakal miner apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and a native of the Ostrava region, Lubomir Zaoralek, of the Social Democrats, reported this quite strongly before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change a put...n board in the toilets, the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a rebate on the new rent price if they sign up now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a refund of half of the amount of the rent that will be received by other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window of Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee said.
And yet RPG covers both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
“This is not a threat, it’s just to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” the company said on its website.
"No one's going to court here," one of the Byty RPG employees thinks, and the man in the street in front of the customer center is right.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uneasy.
"We'll see".
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in the apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the padded chairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of offices have included the architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also houses a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch. design employees have been able to go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design., whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has been designing its mini business kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly from a child-bearing age, and it was important to it that women architects and project managers can return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (in the amount of 2.8 thousand Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and devices and after two years to provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to make the request for staffing.
Childcare is provided by a qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they have more than three times most.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that are replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the program of the mini kindergarten is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children do not just play there but quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation at the school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly towards the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the locals the nickname House in Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical of Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation we see the geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced by it.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, railings, decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place over two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-family house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and creators have also worked on the facade.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila house and Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot right after its finish because of its organic forms "the House in Bones".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time,with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems bizarre.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction directives of that time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he got the permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded changes.
For example, members of the city council did not like the fact that the pillars of the construction were impinging on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two upper floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the wells of lights.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was listed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into Gaudi's other constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bedside table: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bedroom, so the mattress and the bedside table give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive,:the weight, the size, the age, the state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the mattress will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where one does not sleep continuously, latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad where one frequently uses very thick mattresses with a softening layer, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet, and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.”
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore assume poorly "information" of joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don’t need to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn in the night like after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, which is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in case of visit.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Butterflies-mattresses and decorators who for several years devoted himself to the problem of a healthy sleep and to the specialized furniture.
For a double bed each needs its own bed and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise, you will only have to mount the soffit at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Hélena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of mattress.
The bunk bed, when the mattress and the bunk bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very bad; one should not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and mouthful) sieve.
For this, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
But everything to his but.
And for this, an experience tip from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the lining of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make liners with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for the large models (and for a single person) becomes weight when we remove a weight on it.
Do you have a hardboard in your bed instead of a bedside table?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position slatted bedspreads with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are possible to fold the slats into the rein part.
For multi-position mattresses do not take spring mattresses as it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the lamellae, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the slats that makes it possible to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as their backs,” it’s really an important thing.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "males" have started to use a softening area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer, there are winged or wafered bedspreads with what is known as a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and insinuates the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and bedspreads, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should raise the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the sock or the folded area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones made from straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all well-known manufacturers use soy.
“The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the birch plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, “cools” the man, the coatings “warm” the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattress made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity).
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the mattress is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses can be provided by manufacturers or producers for the price of one for special actions.
As for example the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lascivious or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and great thickness was started with Tempur matter at a "cosmic" rate.
This started as matter for NASA because the astronauts were undergoing huge load factors at the start.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is therefore ideal against sleeping sickness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot pads that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child leads more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the little Anicka touched a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there will be another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company MACro Weil, which is one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
“Even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a pre-arranged abduction, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Right now, it’s the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
“In such cases, the criminals will always be ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, she admits that such devices can help with an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a certain period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in an elongated position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software.
The problem with today's tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn on a pendant the size of a matchbox or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina from the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts a vehicle's current position.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence bought 224 km of it.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an exercise in explosives every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Pickek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
There is no mention of the lack of body wash.
“And I don’t mind if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us.”
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that we as merchants strive to please,” says STV Group Chief Commercial Officer Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
STV Group's Jan Decky, however, reports only four years of life for the detonating cords and the police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
“If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years,” says a two-year-old who doesn’t want his name published in light of criticism from the military.
The lifespan passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The department's other argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of buyers from the Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating cords more modern and reliable.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
To this day, I benefit from the contacts I have gained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the contest of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of graduate school, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there was another one of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotels franchise showed up,” the number one entrepreneur of the past year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition has served well," Pytloun adds with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I have to say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge to this day that he could not have obtained otherwise.
“With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the success-related reputation also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I see in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally acknowledged.”
“It’s not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award has not only encouraged me and my employees, but also increased our self-confidence to fight against competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in the vicinity of his father for the manufacture of plastiques in the bath.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who have started to realize that they are collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not happened to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was made on the basis of the economic results of 2008 and partly in 2009.
And it was in 2009 that the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
“We obviously didn’t escape this situation.”
“The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society needs to know that from time to time unpopular measures need to be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained positive results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
“We have built a training and research centre with endowments, strengthened the company’s presence in international trade fairs and won major awards in national exhibitions,” says Zdarsky.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affidavits go back and with them the number of employees as well.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been removed.
The unglorious winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey has been the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Highlighting all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and removing those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If there were 3,000 voters last year, at least 4,000 have cast their ballots this year.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only curb the company, and,this, more and more.
“We may be among the number of documents to fill out for tax returns in the top places in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first set up in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also by the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees there is, for example, the obligation that the maintenance vehicles of highways and highways pay the tolls, or that the contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts <0xC3><0xA5>tons in the hands of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a stroke of the sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee to the Labour Office, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by a Department of Health order last year—the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the company in a reasonable and fair manner.
“We want to support companies that monitor their company’s environmental impacts and run a socially responsible business,” said Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
For this first year of this subcategory of the company's competition of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In either case, it concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the example of the Prague-based pro-software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of its employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In taking care of employees with health problems, we can also mention the old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 percent and which, for this, has obtained the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemian region and which placed third in the region in the competition of the Firm of the year organized by Vo.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a decrease in salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a DIY activity in the immediate vicinity and cares about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit in the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support The Man in the Shadow Foundation which helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the very last rank, also for its activities, there is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had replied to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and had sent it back to the organizer before 15 August, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
The poorly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in question had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Firm competition but were not disqualified from the "main" competition the Vodafone Firm of the Year".
“Independent registration is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year,” says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos.
It had sought to manipulate precisely a public call for tenders for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land would be obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for an insider's offence in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition," Antonie Zelena, head of Plzen's Public Prosecutor's Office, told the newspaper Pravo, noting that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
In a question from Pravo, Lubomira Cerna, spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a customer and under no circumstances an employee," she said.
According to Cerna, the real name of the public tender is "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is put in place when several eligible candidates appear.
“These people propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their right to restitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced.”
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of purchasers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund's spokesman explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information regarding the persons who had registered for the call and since he himself is also a beneficiary person because having purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in on the fact that he was retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He was involved in the case of former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been made.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place and place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of one hundred crowns per month for housing.
Starting in January, households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to withdraw from their wallets up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to bring home 100 crowns more annually than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energies, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
It is also possible to add a hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, the families of Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 percent is being prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change, the pragmatists will pay a 6.8 percent surcharge.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation rose by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase by up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This is a result of the experience of doctors who experience cases similar to hospital admissions in children's departments.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
“The trend is really strong alcohol,” says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children’s department at Horovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of papa in the cupboard, it's sometimes whiskey but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," the head of the department said.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today, it is fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Pelikan Head of Department, seeing drunk children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen admitted to the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced for ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem weird to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours,” the director of the department said.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of the parents or their unusual tolerance to the fact that their rejections indulge in the drink that are the main cause of the development of alcoholism of children.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that are not found in children."
“In those who use the acool repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background,” explained the Pelikan Head of Department.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a poisoning rod requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan there are three seasonal waves that can be counted on: the day of the witches, the New Year and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink despite bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course, I experienced the day of witches an admission of 7 drunk children at one time," Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detox under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "woody mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They are better off because they have a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them.”
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drinking has cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay for a single evening," Pelikan added.
However, in his view, health insurance companies in their declining management, which are expected to recover from parents the costs of care, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech Army and were in flight.
The remaining Lestrois aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
“The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for exchange have been taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investment for the Ministry of Defence.”
"The two-seater L-159 T1s were exchanged in the state," Pejsek told Pravo.
He said that the army will not be left without a two-seater since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159s into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
“The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft will be EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
“It is therefore up to the person who is considering how to do this,” Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not initiate a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
Defence management argued that the exchange would ensure a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and used only 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European-wide tender and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the ring is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the index longer than the annular are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly for men before age 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer testing, including combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter right-hand index than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60, the risk reduction reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not think, it seems, that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is covered in snow and the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the wipers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile club central (UAMK) told the information
In the 91st kilometer a truck was hit, in the 93rd two heavy trucks crashed, the accident injured.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks collided with it.
Drivers should leave right after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A queue of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car lines are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest mode of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is still to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast links because of the snow.
Lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling in vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road of Brno it begins to exist in places of snow gusts and on the road of Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain routes of communication in the places located above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snow blowers and snowblowers.
We can't predict when they'll be rolling.
On the road to Hodonin prudence is of rigor in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it fell as much as 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent a new “smart” weapon, known only as the XM-25 code, to Afghanistan.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon
Its projectiles are laser-guided with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly shattering explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel shards, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier basically uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you were aiming at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon charges and fires at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 Delocalized Jobs
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located at the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the 400-man and women's workplace, located so far on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "For us, Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the connection to the airport is just as important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday brought the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered in this way.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relating to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is well-suited to the city and its deployment is a major boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby “small vertical,” as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, were part of the spa’s controversial construction project.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall, which generated a lot of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be part of the car park, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is the world’s third-largest supplier of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, is home to, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon's Expulsion of the Server - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may hide political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange, apparently resides in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever-increasing force.
The group of cyber activists “Wikileaks” no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said on Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Great, our dollars are now being spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's associates.
The president of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, The Guardian reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in light of previous WikiLeaks publications of classified information,” the senator said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, thereby endangering our national security and life around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
WikiLeaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to the London-based newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions initiated against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief Government Advisor Stephen Harper told television, ironically, that Mr. Assange should be “killed” and that Mr. Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely passing on the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed responsible for combating the leaks.
Travers is tasked with implementing the “necessary structural reforms” made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also committed to verifying the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by the revelations of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a huge success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
The glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated showcase using a spatula, arranges it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbets manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams out of its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a huge success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream that span several days, as well as hands-on sessions in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people are dreaming of a new career, others are simply at risk of realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, an art education professor from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product to the country of Industrial Ice Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is an advisor in business management and she wants, after a few years, to draw something unique from this challenging profession for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice creams.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency is decisive.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation of the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out of it a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately confronted with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice creams "made from natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers in spite of this: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, you only have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will not scratch anything but ice pellets.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit ray or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and paste.
"the suppliers will all try to get you back dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Or in the recipes of fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added to it, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is absolutely not better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice cream," Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruits (winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic base mass manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture available is simultaneously beaten to make it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, minor outages are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo smudges fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that such an incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time.
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we got to know each other well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of Efsa's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements elaborated correspond, by paragraphs, to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period, and in so doing, she changed sides.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which raised suspicions both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from European MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the U.S.-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This body considers itself to be a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong, among others, to the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding trials in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
“We want to know what, for example, are the impacts of genetically modified corn on the field,” says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, then how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls security research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got some fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting her to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingu, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that took place in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when, in September, newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing on average 80 kilos, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full truck loads.
About half is still crammed into the forest, the rest having been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, private individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These scandal stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "M<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or limitations of grass-stripes.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"was not this political component."
He gets into his all-terrain car, goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did some law studies that he dropped out of, and later began to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He amassed treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's fighting back.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
In the past, they were part of the Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke bridge in Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a fingertip: Red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuff from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once hand-carved and moved using simple sticks and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into play."
He did not become rich, much less rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to be saved, too.
Talent Struggle to Conquer High Potentials
The counter has a strong influx.
16 students scramble to buy salmon buns, tomato sauce, and whitefish.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in the competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible into the amphitheatres before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities don’t publish statements about their students’ performance, we try to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group amadoue the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the premises of the group.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into line as collaborators.”
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
“In the past, the focus was on the professional project,” says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In the real estate sector, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting through a pool of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly skilled labor.
It is especially the graduates from the engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will widen even further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the U.S. in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who must participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct amelioration on campus, small and medium-sized businesses do quite classically by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in professional fairs."
“For example, at the solar technology show,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. St<0xC3><0xBC>be is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put to the competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is to go through the university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or write his/her graduation project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise itself by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group cannot do that,” says St<0xC3><0xBC>be, chief of staff.
For a long time, money no longer holds the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute is an annual honours board for German employers.
To this end, it questions employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context, while looking at employee framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff, Ms. St<0xC3><0xBC>be, hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external evaluations with regard to a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best messengers.”
When you treat your employees well and they identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” Kriegler said.
Obama Puts a Brake on New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern U.S. state, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and, thus, definitively canceled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
It is the April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that is behind this strict ban, which is expected to remain in place for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident, which claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, subjected to pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to this day, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion dollar claims, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze on the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the drilling ban passed on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country Ogoni is dry
The water that flows in the rivers is oiled brown; it gives off a smell similar to the one that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't exhaust yourself," the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the splash of water in the color of the rainbow.
One cannot see that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom relates that she once collected shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages comes to the fore when one traverses the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a scalding brown water; whoever dips his hand into it removes any oil-covered water.
The roots of the small mangrove emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
We look in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually find in wet areas: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a phantom silence falls on this former paradise that looks like a service station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari in a sad tone: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a field of battle besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to be employed to disrupt its production activities.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are too unexploited, because the situation is too untapped.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of the steel trettles like bizarre sculptures: It is very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees" the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are gnawed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time into pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have spilled onto the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which flowed into the sea during the accident of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest disasters in the environment.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists regard explosions of drilling heads and drilled oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group for applying substantially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of driver failure is "far higher than allure".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of boulders and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with boulders up to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many tunnels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a motive on the site must be spotted: a small underground refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the drops of kerosene fall and diesel is finally obtained.
That’s how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: “This brings us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
There is only one refinery in Nigeria.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low one of just 40 cents per liter of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material for free.
According to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta as a result of the "protectors" who are putting the oil pipeline network into drilling throughout the Ogoni country.
Only a small fraction of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: The organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion’s share in tankers and bridle it into the global market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate over whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relationship with Shell has deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the group's withdrawal. "maybe operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
Then Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time you got rid of it,” announces the hard-working oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this little thing has brought our country down," Akpori laments.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380's reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety issue.
By examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible construction failure that can lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had apparently been more fortunate so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors on some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warned of a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipe, according to a statement released Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
The reactors are manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Quantas company's Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now filed lawsuits against the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas Director Alan Joyce said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the Quantas airline had immobilized its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany glitzy: With glacial temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service personnel worked permanently, but they could not cope with the snow that kept accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (FHS) expects the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein to be affected by tidal waves with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow accumulations on highways and federal roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather alert center Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow as strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck at night.
Even in the land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic disruption and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, the trees that fell on the railways, the chains or the needles that were destroyed.
In Saxony, we had to stop interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snowstorms swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stranded at the airport, but only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rammed down a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: Snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will whirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to at least 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could fetch up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, “We are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them back on lease later.”
Thus, Germany’s largest financial institution has already given up its headquarters, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have swallowed, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, meanwhile renamed "Green Towers", to about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been inserted into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, parents and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a blazing sun at Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were put on display in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the commemoration that New Zealand has nurtured hope that miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on November 19.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", the warrior's epic.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees the brutes from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses evil methods.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, by way of one or two sentences a few terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking world, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent traveling.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a pity that they mutually exclude each other.
Since the release of Pusher, director Winding Refn is seen as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantin, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and experimental cinema.
Most art-cinema enthusiasts must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Action film lovers die of boredom when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew arrives in America.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is above all because of the magnificent images of misery that has deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully next to the blind man, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose mobiles are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents decay, but perhaps also, only for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which has as its purpose the angst, enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria built, it appears with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the US intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008,the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been used since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he made sure he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, saying the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the “unused military building” and proceeded to methodically flatten the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from a member state showing the moment that directly followed the attack. it appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always maintained that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it implausible.
Since then, Damas has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection of the al-Kibar site and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then-Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never comment on this.”
Thus, the investigation into this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without a result being achieved, and it "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility issue of the Agency", as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Arms.
The IAEA believes that in order to make progress, the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor must be clarified.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated which facilities are involved here, nor what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also under the name of neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly adjacent to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors from all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is information provided by US secret agents that has attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production."
It would have "no indication of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are indispensable to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to the non-enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses regarding the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium needed to make the bomb would later have been separated.
It is unknown whether the prints, which could hide traces of high value, were stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with earth have disappeared, no one will have information about the place of storage of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for storing radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famed Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite images show, however, that Syria has undertaken grounding work at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help to dispel the suspicions.
He said in the diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there. This plan was supposed to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time spent shows how much interest inspectors have in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus has also put an end to this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not have been reported for this matter, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been evoking what is known as special inspections for a few months now, one of the most powerful means of putting the agency under control.
The director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already talked about "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to think: "Would it be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in a time of war
It’s been a long time since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav War.
Federations of Bosnian women immediately protested, and in response, some footage planned for Sarajevo was moved at the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims' organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed that these women meet with them in Hungary, but they declined the offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says it enough about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights remove Angelina Jolie's status as a goodwill ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything is going well again with the Irish.
No sign of consternation.
That’s why the local team is overwhelmingly dominating visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy against the background of loud music, they climb their feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner wins 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to attend the world championship of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The country of my birth is so far away and I have no job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event planner, maybe a good sign" says the young man with a smile.
Due to the gloomy prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, her brother Colin now works as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even expect a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, the grief now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, particularly affects well-educated young Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and social decay seemed absurd in the years of the economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
But, in the meantime, three out of every ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times has published widely letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: “In Ireland, everything is drifting.”
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing powder in the face and offering no prospect of a future for young people.
“They’re cutting minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old student said.
She sees her comrades cramping from one unpaid internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is emigrating in four years.
“It’s a sad and depressing thought.”
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair which offers full support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for those new to the profession to take the first steps in the ranks of the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a chore, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically no longer live.”
He bursts out with an embarrassed laugh as he passes through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, 100% financed by credit.
“There were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, sips hot tea and says, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn’t like the lamentations he’s often heard lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what was once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working for a while abroad is not what can be worse, maybe it’s what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years there and in Ireland, life just went on.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let go of the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his list, He already has a few years of work in London. This is the reason why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries him well in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a good-bye night.
“Just not a lot of emotion,” he says, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Good-bye, it still seems worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averaged 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy rose from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country’s democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America rocked support for democracy.
While this has held up well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only suffered a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again this year to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, translates into a largely shared sense of progress.
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say that they or a loved one has been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the troubled and fear-stricken country.
Voting boxes and a new ballot, ballot papers scattered in the gutters, battered polling stations and intimidation were presented.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations high-ranking official in Haiti, sees the event as "a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, an unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null and void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
Weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, president of Argentina, has enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rate by 20 points, to over 50%; it is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, apparently in mourning, that she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian slapped one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, Budget 2010 will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical bureau, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high global agricultural export prices from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to INDEC's clean-up.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If it does, it needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very much in demand.
When the Argentines will return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband's policies.
A Half-Hour for China
Taiwan's voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and city councilors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just now.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoralties, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned toward Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including tacking trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot Mr. Link, purely through the face, injuring him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to its cradle.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was in trouble: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office and local antennas would be revamped.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Nominations at the Grammy Awards: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to become acquainted with it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a large-scale nomination in the category of "best new artist".
Considering Spalding to be a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding in comparison to the blazing success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent of those ten years for the Grammy Awards.
Elsewhere, voters at the Grammy Awards have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity” in the “instrumental album” category, a ride on a thrill invigorating from a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positoutly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of New Orleans' raucous voice and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; he also strongly leans toward a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue’s Wild Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved accolades in the grand ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs’ rich chamber-jazz Ensemble and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album “Pathways” from his octet’s live was such a fine example of that demotic low-handed band.
Grammy Award Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classic Categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are "God Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in the running for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A Classic Producer of the Year category features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Concertgebouw Royal Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrium ved" by the various "Symphony" artists; "Sacrium ved" and Synergy Vocals" by the "S";
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "Lulu" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; and Rodion Schedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer".
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30 minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles-based composer said he soon wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the orchestra performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated vocalists-soloists; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: ma vie, ma chanson"
The Temecula Mosque project has been approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took to the project claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center was in compliance with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention him,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking out for or against the center, at roughly the same speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no longer America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families has coexisted without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration systems manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very special, even though it’s far from a truly ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“One wonders what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in researching life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Science Research, Openton University-Unireich.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to replace each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
“As a result, organizations struggle to distinguish these elements separately.”
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that some form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she says; so the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two show dogs on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke corgis — disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told Reuters.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff’s deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly one-month canine exhibition tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have a little open the windows, so that the dogs can look cool.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the pickup truck at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a reward was given on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start all over again.
A New York federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially leased the plan “pre-packaged” by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, there are no longer any legal obstacles before MGM to get back on track under the tutelage of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility, planned to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which is itself facing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio’s restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, companies Moelis and Cooper receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $375,000 per month for their company’s management services, will receive a “success premium” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on The Hobbit, with Warner Bros.
The studio is to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top contender for this year’s most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic jumping strings of pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button battery toys are increasing, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years or more) are toy-sized stuffed pigs that sing a note when you press them on their belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to press, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years or more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and up), with a backpack filled with quiz playing cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve scheduler.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three self-contained alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Explore Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books, and features an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two biggest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Penguin Club online pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6 to 12) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years or more) is the latest micro-button-battery robot.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin was scouting a town square as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, issuing low-key orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan – China’s overbearing public order officials, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence – to convey a certain impression to a crowd of spectators.
"Hold on!"
"Be perceptive!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and trousers of olive color, were staring at you.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four well-groomed hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they look average,” Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a graduate degree.
The province of Guangdong traded the gray-green uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced low-eyes with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had encircled an uncontrollable snack cart by casting black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his bags and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a major imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police force of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, girth and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have trouble getting a look at this underground urban brigade from China
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon harvester was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, said last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete clean-up."
Skeptics say the approach is far from over.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had real jobs or if they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, ages 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be larger than average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
What it means to be beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxer or a bossu come and serve here,” Zheng says.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has puffy cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider highlighting her appearance to be sexist, she says.
"Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?" she asked in a frowning voice.
Xu Yang, her 21-year-old dimple colleague, says, “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They are not opposed to their mandate being limited, they said, because they are feeding greater career ambitions than simply driving sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many small loaves of bread or tofu bowls as possible before taking the run.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle cart.
Agents describe their functions as rather monotonous than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers’ assets.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, with a sinister face, broke a path with elbows to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we physically fight,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican from Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer under investigation and that he has no intention of maintaining any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, with regard to the matter of the se.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called prohibition of the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the departmental judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks filed by its public integrity section, including last year's rulings against it.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the director general of citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s senior counsel, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was “beating” the Home Office on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth-ranked Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were knocking at a distance in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines arguments of appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – has created a “circus atmosphere”, a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public’s passions.
The request could prompt a panel of appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I’ve experienced this in this trial; I think there’s a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates human rights in a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Hayes, chief counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in last week’s ruling, claiming that the media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the matter.
Appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that dated, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appellate courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which could be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Justice Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he improperly pushed for a verdict by making an unusual decision to bring it to trial.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly agitating the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily jolt of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “looked nothing like what had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on Twitter system coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said the claim, that the news snapshots were more incendiary than the communiqués delivered more slowly, was a Luddite view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeal courts were often drawn to arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they make reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civilization bring cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a forerunner sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “sick duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the committee on the president’s deficit was just as civilised, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual testing and testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent participants' comments revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed on the pitch,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now at the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
The elections evoke partisan passions, and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "canary lame" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is conceivable on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is building on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "sick duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the “lame duck” session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in early responses to the deficit commission's recommendations that include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age, and reducing spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission, made up of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives; which suggests that there are few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “Kleptocracy” and carries some of the bribes and protective money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are conducting huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They are collecting money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was drafted while Yuri Luykov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been few signs of cleaning up since then.
Lujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits over these accusations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “disfunctional” and claim that the government functioned more as a kleptocracy than a government, according to the embassy’s note.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term used in the criminal world/the mafia which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB is pouring money from the biggest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understood that it was better to get protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high.”
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he has admitted little progress.
The embassy note sends reports of men carrying suitcases, probably filled with money, all the way to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank, said in a recent interview.
"But it's part of that bureaucracy."
“It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount to more than 300 billion dollars per year, on the entire scale of Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir discontent within the Russian government; although Lujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to solve the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the remarks that U.S. diplomats had released by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
“The problem is that it’s about our interaction, an important factor in domestic politics in this country,” he says.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure, and, you know, as opposed to ethics.”
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor-quality, crumbling concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School spoke of the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly face the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced to 35 years in prison the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as “Duch”.
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil.
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-United government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have plunged into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few Khmer Rouge elite officers kept their local leadership positions in exchange for having laid down the weapons, they are low-grade, unskilled farmers.
“These people have received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is hard because we have to support ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to start the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to judge the top leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers would have been killed.
Recently, on a hot night, Im Chaem was returning from field work near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is peaceful and stable,” she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is reconnecting broken pieces,” he says.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history books, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he returned home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are wary because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the courtroom are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful allure here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a road, invaded by weeds and littered with plastic bags, leads up to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated at the spot.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to procure an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and weakly enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’s research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Careful coordination and organization have been put in place to build trust," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not objected to the CIA’s thefts.
The government has not objected to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, had asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to "show that they were exercising adequate vigilance on the aircraft".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report had "surprised the Zapatero Government out of hand" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence thefts over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “taken off the hook,” Aguirre recounts in a cable.
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, the head of the Foreign Ministry at the time, told the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity for influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez conveyed to the Embassy that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the CIA's Department of Defense on flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown concern over "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba told him that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to make sure that they are aware of this".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the government.”
The parricide who went on to confess complained in a network of "accurately" being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she used as soon as she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two originated from Noia, the village of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she is from.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elector was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Minorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to a job to not lose it".
She explained that if all went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him out of my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she taps him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
“Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"There's going to be [the child] at a few hours in the summer and that's how I save a little bit of money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me with money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror <0xC3><0xA0> la galicienne (epigraphe)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilante, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He does not want to think that everything had happened so that she did not tell him that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, from the Minorca Judicial Detainee Centre.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the events happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
Before that, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these committees normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomous elections of 2006, they obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would not win more than 10 MPs (it will not win any more than 10 MPs in the Congress).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority nor the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, Thailand there were three.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the Barcelona Police General Information Commissioner6 were members of a jihadist cell which, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among which "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and the last Thais were killed.
The Ministry of the Interior gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" "was weakened" the apparatus of falsification of al Qaeda at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrated the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of strikes similar to the one recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another one was held in Thailand, with the capture of the Atiqur Butham Buthar and Sihani pak.
They were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell implanted in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found connecting detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were later used by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are intended to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of economic adventures that the philo-sovereignist is addressing as the nationalistic.
The president of the Catalan people came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be liked, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of the institue.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the PP president, to support an investiture "we should eliminate all sovereignist and independentist discourses", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated self-government and the elimination of tax applied to estates and donations slim.
Details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician claims that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatrician La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer from failing to detect the night nurse’s criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrician - who he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by phone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused.”
The person already named as "The Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the centre to medicine.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already admitted that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after successfully committed assault.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threats
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to yesterday's threat from Trichet, which warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the devices have closed to force and the shares of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will soon lose the fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the sale at unlimited access quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that it will even be signalled to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed they hadn’t even considered buying bonds and collapsing markets, the story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year deal auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are conceivable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will resolve itself with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple that of March, to very expensive types, and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "besides being, seeming".
Courage, we can get away with it!
Eulen’s president will challenge Vega Sicilia’s advice asked by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "null of law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the larger business services holding company does not appear to be willing to divest in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting of January 18 this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Trade and Companies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16th, convened by the No. 2 Commercial Magistrate of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunderstorms within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the plaintiffs to his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly cheating the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null and void".
This argumentation will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, being challenged considering that it is "nothing in its right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the services group claims 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the victory of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as the driver of the champion, the German Sebastian Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with goals very far from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to create assembly lines from factories manufacturers all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computing instrument in his Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can move from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that goes on there is considered top secret.
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One is, no doubt, the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notoriety null.
Steve Nevey, the plant’s chief technology officer, said five years ago it could be argued that R&D progress in the case of race cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of the success, while the drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computing, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to install clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count on this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, vice president of HP Spain, gave as an example the refurbished store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM Personal Systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP provides training for facility staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that solves potential problems with HP IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
“This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services,” noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million individual customers in three years, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will hold a three-year maturity.
The objective, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by attracting a million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can get out of the bank - its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank has spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
The customers who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war on liabilities – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater dimensions will be sought."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He says capital needs are “increasing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some bankers are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot broadcast, but contrary to what happened in June, one can obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among banks
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, we can not say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
“Most have been completed; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well,” he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied in the way it is carried out in the time-frame that has been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with Banque-Espagne.
“The move from 45 cash registers with an average of 28,500 million asset volumes to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unsatisfactory opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" the world and he attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that began a process of concentration "very important" and "go at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has made good use of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not an error in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany one begins to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, therefore now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought it should do (plans of fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly sweetened, was approved and in the following months we should be witnessing the process of Union reform that will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely penalized, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace of mind.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the path has been opened to the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The ruse similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrates the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
In principle, the expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink to be poured on the anti-sporting character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the game ended (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will carry out the regulatory sanction during the next match of the match of the dam against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and different economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the related case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and who in past occasions has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mour<0xC3><0xAD>n, and his more educative.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether with these actions one commits a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the regulation of sport, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports mind.
One of the assets that includes the sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with correct play is to prevent the offending team from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is also not the case.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not settle for what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders receive from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match either, as the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action players complete a penalty game and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the steps, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, of which strategic decisions are nevertheless part, which favor the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without overturning the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the line between genius and the fraud of the law is diffused, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears to be due to two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way in which to transmit the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December arrives also come the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive adjusted prices to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners and dinners.
To complete complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (such as the New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated demands in the week of December 13, resulting in so far an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the week before.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying with their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they are all asking for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various establishments in the center, there was a collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
“We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a surge in turnover since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the patronage of Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That’s true, the hope for the festivities hasn’t gone down, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern for the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the WikiLeaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces "more rapid nuclear weapons".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make them difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferating force and a reason to maintain guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The new documentation filtered through the Julian Assange portal is the ever-reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," said: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked General Ashfaq Kayani, during a visit to Washington, to make it “very clear” to the official that “the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups.”
In the hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama will appoint a senior counter-terrorism official to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have any certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track Assange’s movements.”
Nevertheless, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’s creator Mark Stephens said, “Police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.”
The 20th international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries were instructed to identify or locate Assange “to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free way for the arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as an extradition case.
The move infuriated Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
“This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an indefinite interview to Time magazine’s editor-in-chief via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to downplay Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back on his statements after saying Assange would have to be “murdered.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use a plane without a crew or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government that leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod’s followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposed a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe for resolving the yet another internal revolt inside ERC, without the North because of the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party president is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with nods that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the National Council vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s's promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure thing.
The ERC leader has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make sure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the holder of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he points out.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures who come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 charged management with revising the assembly model in a specific congress for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and a thank-you shot to the head, except for the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
Early on Thursday morning, four joint owners of land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl a 50-year-old gentleman was killed with eight shots when he left his house to begin garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the gunshot to the forehead, we found the body of a man on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a .25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency services carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n have been alerted to the discovery of a body in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes bandaged.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n municipality of Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the morning after he was located the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to a message that his ex had.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads twisted and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message beside; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China Continues Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The country's representative to COP16 said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it is continuing its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In her first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that her country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and re-convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various ongoing or completed multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps by cost-effective lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's government's scientific adviser on climate change, said China's efforts were greater than previously thought.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Espino's legal expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Paniste leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the Commission of National Order to demand what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Commission of Order."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission d'Ordre du Conseil National, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that no doubt the council will be able to elect the best leader Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
“I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He predicted that the party’s resurgence in the July 4 elections will be reflected in the next dispute, even if “it’s not yet time to think about 2012.”
"For the moment, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there has been "a lot of hope in regard to them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n because of his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked the Priists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas have been better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, let them start defending them, let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps a cybernetic link open to a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope to have soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continues.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved we will be able to set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a “debate-closing vote” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 youth who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in that country for the past five years, and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the project’s partisan organizations are heavily lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who has completed the term of office of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of Language was a walk in which participants showcased the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you hope from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question, has been de-
The finger on the wound "...we are embarrassed", the Argentine writer gently threw the audience, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio May Garra Monterez and Sergio Montez<0xC3><0xAD>.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she emerges convinced: "patience is not my forte, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is actually open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exposed a delightful narrative that he titled Praise for the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he talks about a famous spell caster who touched clouds, sent back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a ladybird had lost, a narrative that turns to speak then America, the great news that had from the beginning had its own chroniclers of the D<0xC3><0xAD>az and cited the former chroniclers to Bern.
Cervantes, who invented all of us, mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a bitter way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty.
Nevertheless, he stressed, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
“It is through his legacy that we are what we tell ourselves.”
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with his round table The Debt on the Wound.
The Puerto Rican-Cuban woman has laid her finger on the great scourge of social violence her country is going through - and Latin America is sharing - is producing disputes over drug trafficking and sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "final chemical reaction."
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "this is due to the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every negation there is a little yes."
“To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put a finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that inhabit it,” he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, although so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consoled with the sub-champion medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the 2003 close he also came to the decisive duel and was lost again 3 against Rayados with the overall result.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally scored three of his eleven players.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to break away from the evil one to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important,” said the driver when asked what his weak points in the finals would be.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to cross the finish line and we can't cross it."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately we are not in the right place, this is the last chance we have ever had to do so.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to appear at the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the postal service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those wishing to renew their visas will not be required to appear at an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For more information on the new procedure for applying for the visa, visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that she would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Either way, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n 'block' opposite
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just been installed when an opposing bloc led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo appeared in Congress, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANiste Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they did not, they would be again enslaved by both parties and thus end the opposing coalition.
"Until this has happened (the opposition coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, be now "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now Congress has turned into a 'butin' between the two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out of 5 that will probably be 9 MPs, now to the five that we see, separated into different factions, we decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out of it and we are not reforming."
$200 million more for "supplier"
The City Hall of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another check to the respondent owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, as a concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many checks will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official State Journal, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a revision of the checks that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also transacted with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities to replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know how much money you lose, or else they don’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and not just make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall has to change its strategy to properly maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact highlights something that is known to all, the interview is necessary."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
“Luckily Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory that we have to promote this destination.”
IP Demands Results in Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n's business sector is calling for a Labour Legislature that is dignified and free from agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with the society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
“We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
“We will make sure they do a decent job and are especially committed to society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in pursuit of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as a major economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which directly competes with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources into detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a mage king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with 'leaves' for sale in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster,' but I told him 'we'll see, my son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11, is wearing size 12; Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, 10, is wearing size 10, while Miguel, 8, is wearing size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help her a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Cerche Roi Mage, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 Suspected Drug Traffickers Arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in Estonia on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-running investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that has allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without a problem
The Conservatives bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats carrying illegal migrants, is obviously going to be defeated as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created granite under your feet,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow up to a year to hold anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is against the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has dismissed criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats are in favor of taking action against smugglers and that's what we're doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are massively telling MPs they don't tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a sledgehammer."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each MP who opposed would then explain himself to his voters.
The new unit is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Pequis critic on public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, is he just going to say it?"
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government’s boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague Rob Nicholson is currently considering some amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit biker groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has fallen on several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain fell on several regions, that is 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As it is necessary to add these precipitations to the snow melt already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear of overflowing several watercourses.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Le Loup.
Partially Blamed Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio-Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his crude language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their views, but that some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes asistentes sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must provide solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont at noon' addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has been placed on him.
The last dispute involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it was not known with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on it."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008, said.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights all over the place, since for those who don’t like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, he who works as a security agent and as a clerk for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing,” he explained.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four in the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“At this rate, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally took place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most high-profile and prestigious in China," said the sympathetic gaillard.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's biggest stadium)."
“It was a great experience.”
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who beat me was a real pro,” he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"Then, the winners of each category face off in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that obtained the most important, that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"It's the new way of colluding and knocking down competition."
“In other words, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly,” Pequis MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes for.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is in progress and will run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competitive game acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec’s business register allows you to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back the same legal person, Dessau.
Concerning the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay area responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The great Eastmain project manager, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it clear that the project management contract was granted voluntarily.
“If you go to bid and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price."
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that matters, it’s the competence of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has completed 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting his participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau let it fall that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption abound, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even qualifies as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they don’t believe in companies’ environmental commitment, just like companies’ green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by Sherbrooke University’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems essential to stimulate this share of consumption currently driven by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and questionable nature of the information would calm the ardors of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are also wary of the alleged performance of green products or services they seek to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible – the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year – Homo consumus du Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which just took its first snapshot.
A government loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by Société Angus et le Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only on a loan.
The Angus and Parallel Development Society, which were hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on St. Lawrence Boulevard by giving him back his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they were demanding.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who is steering the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be discarded.
Recall that the Association des proprietaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of environmental stakeholders called for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, for ten years carried the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
Angus and the Parallel Society, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition to the wheel.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 next by projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks are raising the bar on what the U.S. sees as the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they are also betraying Canadians' sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to be put under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of a federal election campaign, recounts how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers a few explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues rather than bring this election to the U.S. (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about.”
The ambassador understands even less this "silence deafening" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa business manager, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the drama series broadcast on CBC are returning from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which there are not subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the abductions for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that the spirits are heating up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC’s airwaves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
It echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHGs emitted to the planet would be emitted for light.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to push global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance sheet to be able to stabilize the climate increase to 2 degrees centigrade by 2020 in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100.
These all-new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
It does not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorocompact bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire nervously awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire "without delay" after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General underscores the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission allowed Wednesday’s deadline to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CIS had said on television that the commission was "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls increased on Wednesday around the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign manager, said that the intimidation of voters by the UN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
But opponents of Gbagbo believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any connection to the former rebels, found the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (9.7% including overseas departments), show the corrected data of the provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed stands at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Second-quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over the course of one year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, increased to 24.2% in metropolitan areas (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over a year) and 25% by including the SDGs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over a year), that is 482,000 people aged 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, however, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini arrested and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne General Council, was questioned and beaten at the Luynes house of arrest, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini has been charged with abuse of social property, embezzlement of public funds and property, resalvation, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guerini, had, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday evening and beaten up.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of services of the Aubagne municipality, was questioned on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts that are charged against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been examined and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general for cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "trafficking of influence and passive corruption".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne township, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being investigated, one for "withdrawal and embezzlement of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of embezzlement of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s companion, Jeannie Peretti, was questioned for “rejection of abuse of social property”.
Among those who have been confronted by Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have been used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held the opinion in breath in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some underlying of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going as far as giving them advice for the treatment of their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not have as a counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a raw light how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
Elysée’s strategic affairs advisor, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interviewed U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals who have been forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “constantly hammer” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate liberation.”
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, after the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, "silence will fix nothing", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230 000 euros of bail).
And he says the Elysée is anticipating more hostage crises, a phenomenon that is "going to get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris on a judge's order.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran’s clandestine nuclear acquisition networks, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a trade deal?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he says, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back on the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close supervision" of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through communiqués and "leakages" organized in the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysee to pour into this fiction.
The intensive communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to “sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cendrillon” law that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministry responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who request it free software that allows you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the host countries
Fifa’s executive committee on Thursday designated the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where power struggles and lobbying risk taking over technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front lines.
The head of government hopes to reissue the successful move by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the London Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to bring England's coat of arms back to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its record (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
The world's leading economic power, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new bids appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World Cup-2026 to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would de facto nullify the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar outplaying the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new territories, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: The Evidence
De Gaulle hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate to the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not well-kept with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to act as if the doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he evokes in front of MPs UMP, Tuesday evening in the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a little febrile.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of quinquennials to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has talked about the presidential election, in the tone of humor, in such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,” he told them in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If they raise comments, it is for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy to the PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the entry in question of Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS are calling for an order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it," the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,” said Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to keep its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis, or at least to announce the cessation of a number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to end at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt-based issuing institution will no doubt not be able to afford to be so peremptory as to aggravate a situation that is more than tense today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in helping to resolve the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more disdain for his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for the purchase of State securities in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what happens".
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that there is anticipation of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a noticeable change of course.
While more than three months of loan operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB is still making unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this scheme to be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine she’s changing her program significantly.”
“Otherwise it would be to take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to animate an atoning market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the importance of exposures by European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packing of the returns paid by the most fragile states,” testified a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is making the rounds
After a worrisome start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday, with the 10-year bond rate rebounding.
A return to precarious calm.
On the way out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday anyway, the gap with long German rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to a certain downturn in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain terms, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, putting the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs anymore.
Brussels’ latest forecast has been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying this for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no problem in the immediate, short-term or long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The issue of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period of inopportune decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde again hammered him yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it was demonstrated again on Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, yesterday's relaxation on European government bond rates brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on the banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than the time of markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are on the front lines, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid asking for international aid before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are essential to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
On a visit to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first came up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get its hands on the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with, to date, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be examined carefully in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow events are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and are likely to disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and frost.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and the Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are sufficiently noticeable to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departments were banned with heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking his vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned in Picardie on Thursday.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time when the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion euros are being raised for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, considered in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It reads: “The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a redevelopment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that add?
Mysterious.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement of reasons reads.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenue (both taxes, NDLR), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, we explain."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn up as time goes on."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still to absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat hectic parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Avenging hackers and spies on duty
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's ominously caricatured profile had long been for cabaret artists matter to sketch.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, as I know, editor at Liberation), who only holds what he recognizes as true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of state can telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have turned into centers of pionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secretive secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims as much in crisis as the "criminals".
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
In the days of Orwell, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is a public domain secret; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that all of Hillary’s secrets were empty.
WikiLeaks has done no wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - it would be like publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential relationships by phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore novel, but I am obliged to imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, being carriers only of messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding information from them.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: at bottom, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has restored a telegraph on wires (telephones).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only make it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macro portions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the politics and communication techniques go back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now it is the embassies who ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is squandering its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of fast-start or early-start financing made by developed countries.
And the big French bedouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU launched the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had committed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, setting it on track to meet its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of "all the new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditures of previous years or to the overall level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to “new and additional” financing.
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his or her method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> loan equals 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> given.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At the same time, the country should be counted as the borrower's interest rate for its commitments.
But France has only to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
It's a nice pass!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is operating a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, she manages to make it appear that she is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely duped...
The early funding chapter is just a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): the question of "additionality" or the way of accounting for loans will not be eluded.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Alert to Pesticides Ingested by Children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (formerly the Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Paris and Oise.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as treats, have been reviewed by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The record is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, as encased by the study, shows traces of six chemicals, one of which is banned in France.
The same goes for Kenya’s green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
