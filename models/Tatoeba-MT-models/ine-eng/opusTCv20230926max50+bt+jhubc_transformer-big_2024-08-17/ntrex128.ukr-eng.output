Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned that they will be “associated with the Mappets”
Some CHAs are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their post to “Member of the Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came about because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
The whole political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One CHA from Labour said his group is troubled by Rome with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, “twp” means “unreasonable”, and “pwp” means an act of defecation.
The CHA from the Welsh Party said its group as a whole was “not satisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh Conservatives said his group was “unbiased” about changing its name, but noted that the MWP could quickly become a “mapping”.
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation of the letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Self-Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales received widespread support.
As for how to call the CHA, the commission proposes to call them “Members of the Parliament of Wales”, i.e. WMP, but the MWP option has received the most public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but trying to come to an agreement can cause problems for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the suspension of the AGM and the structure of the committee system.
The CHA will hold a final vote on their new name when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organised with the aim of resolving a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint-Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times
“The old people I’ve spoken to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
There is no one else now.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People today are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer the kind of local living room they regularly go to.”
As for churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as leaders expect, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who remained nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close, because it’s unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin – ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which held ceremonies nearby, received the right of ownership of the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street of Harlem. These traders did not want to hire blacks and raise them.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson wanted to restore it and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical tool.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world, played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger carillon in the Church of Riverside.
According to Mr. Merriveser, in St. Martin he was not found a replacement.
What has been going on in Saint-Martin over the past few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been drawn to church leaders, others to the episcopal diocese.
The council — the governing body of the parish, which consists of the leaders of the Myrians — wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the council, while the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Boy Who Drowned on Lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near Bic<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that in the morning on Saturday he had already been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and together with the group he swam to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a rapture about a captured lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been eaten!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get them out of the water: ‘In the water of the shark!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rada Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was found that it did not belong to dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries to the upper body.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those available in department stores. Working on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased access to the British cosmetics market costing <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is decreasing), increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea is lost, the other stores will come up.
Investments in cosmetics are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelf space, which was previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its cosmetics range and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones similar to those that are in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the Boutique cosmetics range: now most of the presented products will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays at two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the move to buying small amounts of food every day in small shops forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Cupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said their stores will be more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's opened Argos's departments in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats' departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this increased sales of food products, as well as made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split the proceeds from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for shoppers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands presented by us is designed to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 'crazy' over Holly Willoughby's exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones's "Dragon Ball" star is "crazy" because TV host Holly Willoughby has struck a deal with his brand of goods for life (the deal is worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The business of the pair was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Peltrow.
The 37-year-old program leader This Morning announced her retirement from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought Peter Jones’s “Dragon’s Den” star to the fore when she left their lucrative life goods business at the last minute to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “crazy” when a gold girl on TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones’ business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal means that she no longer has time to make a fortune.
This business was linked to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand and was to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly, without a doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
It was to become her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
The headquarters in Marlow are full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of host This Morning, which is one of the UK’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home wear) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp formed Truly in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
Couples spent holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of Baldwin, a television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity host on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
Hard talk, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider “non-presidential,” as well as for his very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump go to such great lengths?
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn’t take any action.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” from the US to its first steps in disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a beautiful relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American servicemen home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-packed stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been affected, a national disaster has not been declared, and this is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children gathers a team for a trip to Pal, it is not known whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster relief agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organisations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains horribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami deposits have been built in Aceh province, but they are not typical of other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was effective, likely contributed to the deaths.
Moving between a lot of Indonesian islands is not easy even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The medical ship, which was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Pal, but will be able to get to the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s infrastructure the foundation of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding shortfall has created problems for Mr. Joko’s administration, which plans to re-elect next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith hostility in those parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and equalizes the score with Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jordan Shachiri when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from the Chelsea gate. At this point his team lost with a score of 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left foot and charged it in the direction of the long pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the top right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping cape of Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always go on the attack as much as possible, so I just tried to provide myself with as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and made one touch, I didn’t think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea were led 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> back, turned around in the middle of the field and quickly ran for half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played in the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a good penetrating pass, which brought Azara to the penalty.
Hazard overtook the defense and made a decisive left-footed shot into the net of the long pole. The ball passed past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed during Friday’s 7.5-point earthquake, which caused waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the agency’s press secretary, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was strewn with rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
The investigation of the murder began after the bodies of the women were found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson-Muse, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who might have filmed something on a video recorder, to contact us, as the information in these videos may be very important to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today in the afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are now informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Muse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Now residents are told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell one man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00 two police vans stood behind the fence, another van in front of the fence.
Several police officers stood behind the fence and watched over the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to write a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and date September 30.
The statue of Cromwell near the Parliament becomes a new monument, which will suffer from the “rewriting of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved reward for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues, the fact that Oliver Cromwell’s statue near Westminster Palace will be targeted was inevitable.”
Iconoclasm during the English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself, nor by his order.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by the sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, according to many, is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, probably more in the late 19th century than they are now, consider Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievement as Lord Protector is also worth noting and venerated.”
A Chinese pig-killer has killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the name Yuan, was found dead in blood with a ruptured artery near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xinjiang, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the pig’s door was open.
The brother noted that there was a large boar with blood on its paws in the pigsty.
Forensic and medical examination confirmed that a 249-kilogram boar defaced the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in blood and twisted,” said the victim’s cousin, Wu, who was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that when police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that the seven I Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks by pigs on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm and caused her husband critical injuries.
Ten years before that, a pig weighing 295 kg kept a Welsh farmer pressed against a tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive flooding to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains with floods to the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The rose had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1 hurricane) as of 5 a.m. east on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a bedrock begins to form, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north to southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, in the coming days, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching sediment, will create strong floods in the southwest.
In this area, from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, garbage streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Severe tropical humidity will lead to an increase in precipitation from 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10,2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise you not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical floods are possible.
Heavy rains can make the canyons violent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring here more frequent winds and dust storms.
The approach of the gorge will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause weak debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, and in the evenings on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will fall over the For-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature shifts can be observed throughout the U.S., as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, you can see a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is an almost 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to be warm by October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast at 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people across six television networks watched the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
The political confrontation continued, with the channels interrupting the planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: an agreement prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had beaten her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this on Friday, as reported by the research company Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get figures on other networks that also showed hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people who watch TV in the office.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to an audience that watches a playoff game or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose thought show hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leader among all channels during the all-day listening, with an average audience of 5.69 million, Nielsen noted.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleck became the central character of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Fleyk when he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was barking, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
He was told, "You have power, but many women are not strong."
Fleck said his office had published the statement and, before the elevator closed, added that it would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for full Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which is demanded by a democratic minority.
Flayka was partially persuaded to talk to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then to several senators, Fleck made a decision.
Fleyk's choice had an impact, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview, which ran alongside Theresa’s interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Checkers Brexit plan, saying that to offer Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other was “absolutely absurd.”
Who shot at Wade Sims: police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting, which led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
Twenty-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials posted a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the report of the affiliate CBS TV channel WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they found the DNA of the Simpsons.
Asked by Simpson, the police said that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given a deposit of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report noting that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Special Investigation Team, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Louisiana State University Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agencies for their “carelessness and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “destroyed” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano throws ash at Mexico
The ash, which ejects the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Natural Disaster Warning on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began activity and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and pulses.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars in the outskirts of Mexico, such as Hochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede.
A pro-separatist group in masks held back by special agents threw them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, a group of supporters of independence, who chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive!”, faced supporters of the country’s preservation, who shouted: “Long live Spain!”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were provided with assistance in connection with the light injuries received during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but is marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but the turnout was low, because the majority of those who opposed the department boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to go another route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for the joy of being able to vote, but now we have entered a dead end,” he said.
Despite the vital, but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, which are in favor of independence, were unable to maintain the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or exile.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we are seeing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Entered the House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinaard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was shot from a crossbow.
Menga's strike secured Livingstone's victory over Rangers with a 1-0 score
The first goal of Dolly Menga in the composition of "Livingston" became the winner
Raised in the Livingstone class, he stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerard his second loss out of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menge's strike proved decisive: Gary Holt's team climbed to one level with the Hibernian in a second.
Gerard's team has not won a single Premier League away win this season and will play the Harts leaders next Sunday, from whom she lags behind by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues his undefeated run to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has yet to be defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing out on the opportunities that non-residents have.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before they scored, because their straightness creates the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a blow along the gate, then Alan Lithgow broke through the gate after he pushed back and took Craig Hulkett's blow along the gate, which he made his head.
The owners were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
That's how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson involved Meng, who took the ball and scored from the penalty spot.
Before this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the defense of the owners of the field proved impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not worried.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick kicked off Rangers goalie Allan McGregor's legs. Lithgow kicked past the goal in another standard Livingston combination.
The suspensions were constantly flying into the Livingstone penalty and were constantly neutralized, and two requests for a penalty - after the attack of Hulkett on Glenn Middleton, who came out to replace him, and for the game by hand - were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingston": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Toni Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All to one played well, they continued to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition had hardly changed after returning to the highest level, but Holt should be given due for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett played great, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s guidance, but now they don’t quite reach those standards.
They missed the last ball — only once they broke through the defense of the owners of the field — and it was something like an awakening for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an ambiguously received in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, a smile and a blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Among them were some disputes on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — have also made themselves heard. They condemn Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests indicate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero, and others - a dictator.
A road accident in Depford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road near Deptford in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after escaping the driver from the scene of the adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday crash.
London police said they were working to establish the identity of the man to inform his immediate relatives.
Driving is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Inmates Injured in Riots
Six prison employees have been injured as a result of riots in a male prison under a strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began at about 9:30 a.m. British Standard Time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the riots, initiated by the eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
Officers were provided with medical assistance in connection with minor facial injuries received at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “In order to resolve the incident that continues in Her Majesty’s Long-Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff have been recruited.
Six of the employees received medical assistance in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the duration of their stay behind bars can be extended.”
In Her Majesty's Prison Long-Lartin, more than 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent to hospital for treatment after the inmate's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to stop serious riots, during which prisoners were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential floods (this may be in favor of arid areas)
Tropical depression rarely strikes the Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa travel through the desert’s southwest, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday on the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is predicted from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas south-west of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, sometimes up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no flood risk, the Rosy rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second-highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
The rose, still in power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km/h.
The storm occurs with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that under the force of a tropical storm during the day or in the evening, Monday, the hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be significant, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total amount of precipitation from Lower California to northwestern Sonora will be from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, in places possibly up to 25.4 cm,” — reports weather.com.
Next Rose will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will go further through Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday will reach southern Utah.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwest American desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening torrential floods and waste streams in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested in connection with a murder attempt
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer-Norton at approximately 04:00 British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking for feedback from anyone who can have any video recording of these events on their phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Tolerated Uglyness and Anger' by Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the ugliness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the impeachment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, dispassionately and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that he committed sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearings about the accusations she had made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president casually mentioned Kavanaugh’s impeachment when he talked about the importance of Republicans’ turnout in the mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, we will have some of the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “oppose and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing
At least 384 people have died, many washed up in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country's authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high crashed into the beach in the evenings, knocking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami occurred after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately start to run away, and they became victims,” Purvo Nugroho, a representative of Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been overturned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Riots in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical position, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the strength of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "widespread" and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under fragments of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and damage could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged and we did not receive any information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had fled to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Pal, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
In the amateur footage that people shared on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of the house sounding crazy warnings about approaching tsunamis to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water slammed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage, which cut off the link around Pal, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other essentials.
The city’s airport was only opened for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the yard of their office, but along the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to go to Pal.
According to the Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted.
The second night fell on Palau after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, and friends and family of those who have not yet found it, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones will be a miracle that will decorate these gloomy plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers received a woman who had been lying under a rock for two days with her mother’s body nearby.
Handon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Handon tells how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the community of paragliders, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the opponents of Pal, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick, and not with double blue ticks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 during the replenishment of the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran an ATM in Newport on the Levee, the Newport Police Department reported.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "runs back to Brink's employee" and steals a bag of money intended for replenishment.
Witnesses noticed several suspects who fled the scene of the crime, the news said, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Earlier officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West was called Ye for some time, and he used this abbreviation as the name for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name, earlier West said that this word has a religious meaning for it.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
The canyon, which means "one", was shortened to simply "there" - it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy, and Daddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brazer Love.
West's former colleague, JAY-ZI, also experimented with hyphens and capital letters.
President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
Newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco square, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements began to form throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying, and to open more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China ramps up AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on AI research, according to AI investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 for innovation in the field of AI by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S., Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Sustainable AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Othello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee noted previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency’s Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next would be to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. increase its efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be offered automatically to candidates of science in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, while the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission, has not taken any steps in a few months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's ability to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Georgy Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum, and through the boycott campaign there are doubts whether the minimum 50% of voters will reach the turnout, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum ballot reads as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership on the condition that the agreement with Greece is accepted?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not carry legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of the votes in parliament will be needed to change the name.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations had been received until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the ballot box.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” 62-year-old voter G<0xC3><0xB6>ze Tanevskii said in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko cast their vote in a referendum on changing the country’s name, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymyr Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is above 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will vote in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its start in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed the defense of Brighton and brought the Manchester City victory with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal at the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of "Bryton" and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then ran a few more to the edge of the penalty "Bryton".
Then he made a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right butt launched it into the right part of the gate, causing the defeat of the goalkeeper "Bryton" Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at this point.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this Premier League match was provided by Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made several touches and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of the long pole.
The sky blue forward threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped out of the line.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to pick up points in “Rokis”
As the Washington Nationals team was out of the playoffs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But the competitive Chercer hopes to go to the pitch on Sunday in a game against Colorado Rockies, provided that the Rockies will still have difficulties with the exit to the playoffs. Now the Rockies for one game ahead of Los Angeles.
The Rockies at least have a 5-2 win over the Nashionals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure a first division title.
“Despite the fact that we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I’ve seen all year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?
Nastionals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning towards the fact that it will be Shercer.
The heart, for which it will be the 34th start, held a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, its usually weekend.
The Washington Right has a score of 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The president casually recalled the situation around his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters’ turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, we will have some of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones — I’m not running, but I’m really running, so I’m fighting for great candidates wherever I can,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are firmly set to return power, using any means, you see meanness, swearing.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to step in to get power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen this over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein after him, prompting the audience to loud cries of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you provide the document?
Well, that's it.
No, uh, no, I’m waiting — it was really a bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it was almost no surprise.
In the end, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not happy, and all this is because we are expressing our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in almost the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from Labour were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it was ever implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party is not allowed to have different views, and every opinion is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, with whom, as I had previously thought, I had similar political views, began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and take a position that I would never agree with, whether it was national security or a single.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is followed by a tirade of attacks on social networks with calls for recall, condemnation of the center’s policies, I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I am delighted by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist attacks every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “distrust” or change in the rules of selection the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly that "everything was fine" with me.
But that’s not what I came to politics for.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because, due to the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, my high school class has literally collapsed, and since then I have sought to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it’s a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has embarrassed me by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say just one thing: In conditions where the country is stepping into Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, and no: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to withdraw me and no political gain will prevent you from doing so.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": undefeated "Air" climb up
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Scottish Premiership.
Now they lead the table, this is the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the excellent defense and improved ability to use the chances gives the hosts and coach Peter Merci full right to be satisfied.
“So far we have been tested by our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, “I’m giving up Air, they were better off taking chances than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Klimo, brought "Air" forward, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggot used the unrealization.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of Air with a penalty and immediately before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave a score of 17-5 in favor of Air
But Melrose had a good start to the second half, and Patrick Anderson’s effort, implemented by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, which was taken out of the field on a stretcher, and the restart of the Air broke out ahead with the help of Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Klimo.
Captain "Air" Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced another player to pay for the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The owners returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the mall "Air".
Klimo made an attempt, which he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong in the box and sent flanker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the host team.
It seems that the star of the series <0xC2><0xAB>All the game» is set for a new career in the restaurant sector
It seems that the star of the series <0xC2><0xAB>Still game» Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the field of hospitality. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script for which he writes and in which he starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglange.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
<0xC2><0xAB>Our Sea»: domestic Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the equipped headquarters of the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “Our sea is on the right.
We have to bring him back.”
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, still has a memory of the loss of the coastline that left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia waits for an international court decision on October 1 after five years of consideration of the case.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calsad<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICU decision on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will take a decision in favor of Bolivia, which after decades of sparse talks Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia who has faced opposition to his re-election next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, then little will change.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICU, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could contribute to the rollback.
“The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chile’s benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltse, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of discord, with mutual benefit,” he said.
Callad<0xC3><0xAD>a also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political militia.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
This resolution is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea Says It Won't Have Nuclear Disarmament If It Can't Trust U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which went into a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the belief that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration of an end to the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is an “undesirable dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headgear, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown showcased a number of eccentric oversize-style headwear from the spring-summer 2019 collection at the podiums of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their dazzling creations outside the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide decorated feathered fields, which covered the heads of models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with precious stones of watermelon, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very timely in front of Halloween.
Many of these multi-colored masks had their lips sewn and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature resembled equipment for underwater swimming with a tube and glasses, the other looked like a slice of ice cream, which melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are in luck.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats went into fashion thanks to "Le Bombi", a straw hat with fields of sixty centimeters wide, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkovsky.
A cult brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social media has given the world another creation: a straw beach bag almost the size of a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The yellowish-red raffia bag with a raffia bush and a white leather handle was a central element of the La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection of the Jacquemus brand at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrities stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s impact is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: knowledge of languages is mandatory for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 again received excellent exam results, which are complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which are attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCHNS). They aim to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education of their chosen career, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, they understand it with their mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading in the rankings of subjects with the best scores.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score A.
The data collected in 74 schools of the CIS showed that 72% of students received a higher score A from Chinese, and another 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vitally important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as subjects of NTEM (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics), within independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers can’t close jobs are related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more promising positions require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted among more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you will always be able to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what has prepared them for the future.
Now it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered the “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego
Fans who want to see LeBron James' first start for the Los Angeles Lakers are almost waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play has not yet been decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James was likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of pre-election rallies today in the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies planned for next week, including rallies in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after a vote in November.
At what time will Trump’s meeting in West Virginia take place tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in West Virginia's Willing City is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to mention the strained hearings that took place this week over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
Trump’s representatives said the five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president is going to go to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season is approaching,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to give his name.
Fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, can attend today’s rally at the Wesbank Arena in Willing, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in the past month to West Virginia, a state where he garnered more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, whose rating lags behind the results of the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his ranking in the polls,” Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team set to fight and full of hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, the afternoon Saturday forsomphs could become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
An emergency impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when do they say the pulse is working?
“They were ahead by six points, and now they’re at four, so I think we take that as a bit of a boost,” Jordan Spitt said as he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, also a lot of encouragement, not least the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
The spit with its killer blows from the ti- Maidan to the grin shows an example.
These glaring shouts of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive patt and equalized the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas lag behind by two points.
His patt, which allowed them to win the match on the 15th hole, was met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team does not seem.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own game,” Spit said.
That’s all that each of these players have left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas, in the last two days – Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four of the four and can not make mistakes.
The "Mollywood" were the only couple who didn't make boggies on Saturday after lunch, they also managed to avoid boggies in the morning on Saturday and after lunch on Friday and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this tumultuous crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to cement the potential victory of the Europeans when the National Golf is over.
Preferably both at the same time on different wells.
However, it is too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had an affair with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning soccer game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One god and two doves on the first nine holes led the Spanish and the Swedish to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe the forbols and forsoms closely because of the interaction between the participants of the pair, because of the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and it is also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of forsoms has also shown that the US team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday’s matches and forsoms, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, they won two victories over trailing Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, who is trying to win back the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning matches with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. faced more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but were unable to reduce the gap.
Team Jim Furik needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Mullinary (alongside “Mollivud”) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in the history of the Raade Cup after a sensational weekend.
Crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the head-to-head, they teamed up to defeat the bloated Woods and rookie American Bryson Deschamps with an even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in foreboding and foreboding and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning forbolls, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the forsoms to get a 2nd-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe could not do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time top scorer Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive 2–1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the forbolls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with a 4–3 score in the forks, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team returned with a four-point deficit in singles, although Furik's team needs only one to retain the trophy.
However, after second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their power.
North Korea says “no way” will not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepens mistrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will in no way be able to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing itself not to deploy nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
And while Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s opposition to the “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement proved important in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the real U.S. president and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised Korean security guarantees.
North Korea aims to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and raises the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal forcibly, and even objects to ‘declaring an end to the war,’” he said.
“To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, at which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, were a party to this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have happened.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year’s when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s targeting of missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” who wants to commit suicide.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for the courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
Trump said Wednesday that he does not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and relentlessly until we see complete, definitive, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with the aim of blocking the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said that, according to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he needs are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning crunch all night after refueling with caffeine.
The professor found that the number one university students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaser, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, one girl came up to him and said, “Why am I being told this now, in the last class?”
“She told me that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” the teacher told The Telegraph.
On the course, which was introduced for the first time this year, students explain the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and sports results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep within a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, exercisers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficiency on athletic performance, as well as the importance of a sleep-related routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Chassler.
A culture of pride for “insomnia all night” still exists, he added, noting that modern technologies and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a set of excess weight, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop the course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students with a request to undergo a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students put reminders to go to bed, as well as put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light”, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengi's goal upset Gerard's boys
Rangers suffered another attack of outgoing sadness: Dolly Mengy's strike brought a defeat to the distinguished team of Stephen Gerard with a 1-0 score from Livingston.
The team of "Aybroks" sought to win their first victory in the away match "Premier's triumph over "St. Johnston" with a score of 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerard a second defeat as a manager from 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not look as if they could equalize the score.
Now the Rangers have dropped to sixth position, and Livingston have risen to third, and by the difference of the balls they are ahead only "Hibernian".
In addition, Rangers may encounter another trouble, because the liner Kalum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after he was thrown from the guest sector into some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which once missed out on Air in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt released the same lineup of "Levia 11", which took one point at the Harts last week, and was thrilled by how his infatuated guys squeezed rivals at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingstone worked more with the ball.
They were supposed to score just two minutes into the game when Menga's first free zone pass allowed Scott Pittman to hit the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed that big chance by sending the ball past the goal.
Deep free kick of Keagan Jacobs got skipper Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou hit in the back bar
The Rangers did gain control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to a penalty of a quarter of an hour after the encounter with Stephen Lowless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to make only two shots at the goal in the first half, but former goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassana Kulibali's head and Oviedo Edzaria's calm blow was almost unsettling.
And while Livingston’s 34-minute goal may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to make up for Jacobs' loss.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng for the simple ending.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the winger broke through to Morelos, but the striking Kelly jumped off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the game they liked when Lithgow and Hulkett made one long pass at a time.
Holt's team could have improved the score in the final stages, but McGregor was well up against Jacobs before Litgou hit the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson again took a look.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is coming... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "The Coronado Bells" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious cowboy scientists.
Man: “What’s that at all?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how the radioactivity in the minerals affects the atoms.”
Evans: “Well, it’s really cracking now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, which bears his name, continues to live.

Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to “see” the protein that is common to many types of cancer. Then these cells are reintroduced to the patient.
The trial vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” common to many types of cancer proteins (HER2), and then reintroduction of these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the Bethesda National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several cancers,’ including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers,” he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in baseball MAGA Kanye West gave a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
This caused a negative reaction from the audience.
Viewers at the SNL (Saturday Night Live) show cheered Kanye after his baffling speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball cap that said "Let's Give America Back Former Glory," he exploded with a tirade criticizing Democrats and once again voiced his support for Trump.
“I’ve often been asked, ‘How do you like Trump?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony, which he gave to the Senate Legal Committee in a lawsuit by Christine Blaise Ford about sexual violence.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tirade was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes with him there was an unpleasant situation due to the headgear.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, West stated: “When I was behind the scenes, I was rude.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the audience in this baseball game.”
They were mocking me!
And then they tell me that I am in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
West continued: "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I will wear my baseball Superman because no one will be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
As reported by Variety weekly, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the show SNL looked confused. One of the audience said: "The studio was in dead silence."
The news at the last minute was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
West surprised many by performing the song "I Love It" in a Perrier water bottle suit.
Vesta was supported by the head of the conservative TPUSA organization, Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR standing up against NATO.”
Instead, talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and it's just great."
“But I will NOT reward anyone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who, in my opinion, professes and exorcises an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
“Like us,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he is now "the one who was previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first performer to change his name, following the example of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Pi Daddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lyon, and as we know, the musical legend of the last decades, Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince".
Accusations of attempted murder after a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter after he stabbed another man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The prosecutor's office will consider the charges.
Star of the series "Game of Thrones" Keith Gerington condemns the idealization of brutality
Kit Gerington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the stereotype of a macho hero, arguing that because of such heroes on screens, young guys often think they have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the age of hashtag #MeTo (#everyone, #commitment, etc.).
Cat, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, 31, said he was "pretty determined" to tackle the issue.
"I'm quite determined at the moment. When did we get on the slippery path of idealization of brutality?" he asked.
“Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the prism of the problem we see now?”
Cat believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through images of extremely brave heroes.
He continued, “What is natural, and what is planted for us?
Why does television and the street teach that young men feel the pressure to be just such men?
In my opinion, today’s really important question is “How do we change this?”
“It’s clear that the young guys are on the right track.”
In the interview, he also noted that there will be no prequels and sequels to "Game of Thrones" after the show ends next summer, since "it's already over with battles and horses."
From November, Kit will play in the production of the play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard - the story of the film producer and his brother-thief.
As the actor recently confessed, he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best he has received from participating in the series "Game of Thrones".
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life,” he said.
In the fantasy series, which received the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt, the love of Gerington's hero John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony took place on the grounds of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China declares a sharp increase in the number of new cases of the disease by 14%
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS has been reported.
According to representatives of health authorities, in total there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of the disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time in some regions of China, HIV quickly spread through infected blood during transfusions.
However, health officials said during a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV sexually over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men later marry women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, seeing this as a way to partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican senators' data to her network by a full-time employee and sharply criticizes the "dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned vociferous statements that one of her staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spread by “ultra-right” political viewers and websites.
“Lying, lying, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared in the network on Thursday. They were placed by an unknown person with the Capitol during hearings in the Senate commission on charges of sexual misconduct brought against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the post of judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source of the leak is related to the Waters office and it was able to find the data of its regular employee.
“These baseless claims are absolutely untrue, they don’t correspond to reality,” Waters said.
“The employee of my office, whose personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, including former White House press secretary Ari Flysher.
“This denial is fraught with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not behave insolently.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and inviolable.”
Flaysher seems to have drawn parallels between Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take Waters' place following the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“This is so news if it’s really true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had already reported “relevant state and law enforcement authorities on these false statements.”
"We will do everything possible to find the culprits," she continued, "and they have been held accountable by the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: A New Mission" - a passing parody of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look in every new British film for meanings inspired by Brexit. There are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies on the fighters about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released on the screens in 2003, later the series was renewed in 2011, after which "Ingjili".
Will the ridiculously ironic self-saturation of what we lack become the new export potential of the nation?
One way or another, Johnny English, with his moving face and whitened eyes, was able to make a mess for the second time, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a cheerful secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean and much more – from the guy who played one note of the melody from the movie "The Fireflies".
The protagonist is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale, which has always left behind the disorder that Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten television commercial of Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Inglis there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglis was approaching the helicopter in his knightly armor, and the propeller blades were dangling around his helmet.
The film reveals Atkinson's talent for arranging a buffoonade, but the humor is fleeting, and at some points it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
There is an impression that jokes are intended for children rather than adults, and the senseless attacks that happen to Johnny Inglis don’t seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson’s jokes in silent films about Bina.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there is a serious threat over the UK.
In the British super-secret network of spies penetrates the hacker and reveals the names of all the field agents, which became a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last straw for the prime minister – an apprehensive person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey as best as possible the image envied by Theresa May, however, the script did not give rise to an uproar).
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she needed to bring in someone from the slums.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny Inglis, who now works as a teacher in some super-fashionable institution and unofficially teaches children operative work undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year" Inglis for teenagers was several successful jokes).
Inglish is quickly taken to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he reunites with his long-suffering friend Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an excited, bored person does not quite match the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty has gone awry, "Batman and Robin" return to the series and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network, the gambling Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a trip and again resort to their ridiculous tricks: disguised as waiters they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going abroad on a luxury yacht Volta, Ingly szhlya;
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and insanity he somewhat resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As I watched other Johnny English movies, I asked myself the same question: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour have denied the plan, which says Britons will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to discuss a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week, but receive a five-day paycheck.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the heads of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers, giving them an additional weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and direct the resources of the country to support the working class.
The move to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
A source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week is in line with the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour was not the first to approve the idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The party’s political programme does not envisage a four-day work week, so we are not considering this idea right now.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party's pre-election congress last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "disliked directors" of utility companies and "collectors."
The “shadow” chancellor’s plan also means that water company shareholders may not get their full share of the capital if the Labour government imposes “offsetting” on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the company’s board of directors and to set up inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers who are expected to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the show 60 Minutes, whether the investigation of the Kavanaugh case, which is run by the FBI, can change their mind
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is the head of the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether Senators-Republicans will continue to support Kavanaugh’s results after the hearing.
On Sunday’s show, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I told you that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything had happened and the charges had been dropped, and I asked him, “Did you really do this?”
He was determined, unwavering, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change.
"I believe that the prosecution of Kavanaugh is a provocation," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and an equally exciting mission – to overcome poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Great Hall of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organizers are striving to overcome the extreme form of the year 20.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to an event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must complete a number of tasks or "actions" such as taking a study in a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else to help get you engaged.
So are there any results already, because the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a performance with a free concert really a genius way to convince people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they are really changing something by signing an electronic petition or posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “actions” of their supporters aimed at achieving various goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in planned financial allocations and programs that will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited as an example of the results of its activities 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of about 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial obligations can be mentioned fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to the UK. Within the framework of the project, investors and implementers took on the obligation to "help children grow" and promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million in assistance as a result of the lack of
“With the support of the UK government, patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of undernourishment a minor fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 "actions" that called for improved nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving nutrition for 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on their website "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: “This is a long and difficult road, so sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the members of the civil rights and anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at this year’s festival in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of the Interior said that the United States can use naval forces for a "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian energy resources
According to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary” Washington can turn to the naval forces for help to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to become a middleman in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
“Thanks to the U.S. naval forces, the U.S. can provide free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we effectively use energy resources and replace them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on energy sources of mineral origin.
While these statements were being made, the Trump administration aimed to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, displacing from the energy market of Russian origin, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “unnecessary” construction project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the gas pipeline "Nord stream 2", the cost of which is 11 billion dollars and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, - exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a tool of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren 'will think seriously' about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting with the public in the city of Goliath, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
According to The Hill, Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and get a government job, and for that, a woman should be in charge.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of Donald Trump’s presidency, stating that he is “leading his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the position of Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "...undoubtedly, the FBI must conduct an investigation before the vote."
However, according to a poll released on Friday, most of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted jointly by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research and The Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in the state of Massachusetts opposed the senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the move.
The results of the poll showed that the former governor Deval Patrick enjoys greater support. 38% voted for the potential nomination of him as President, against – 48%.
While discussing the candidacy of other well-known Democrats who may run in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are also named.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSD of Trek Palin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on the night of Monday.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in the city of Tals, Tals.
Palin called the arrest of Trek "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "are returning home not as they used to be, more brutal, and want to know if they respect here what their brothers did to the other soldiers to go to the country.
According to the spokesman of the police department of the city of Vasilla, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as that he prevented the report of the rape and assault.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the appeal of asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the appeal of the new U.S. policy, according to which victims of gang persecution and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note of the court consultant to Washington to support the plaintiff, who needs asylum and appealed in court the aforementioned policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, a civil rights lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Union that challenges federal policy and was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff claimed that her partner "and his cruel sons-bandits" beat her, but U.S. officials turned her down when she applied for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (whose refugees often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy repeals the Immigration Appeals Board’s decision in 2014, according to which undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence could seek asylum.
Colombian District Attorney General Carl Reyesin said in a speech Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that the decision on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle,” the court counsel said in an analytical note.
Further, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that a policy that bans immigrants from entering the U.S. harms the country’s economy, as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “replenish the necessary labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order in June for immigration judges that said they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” Sessions said during a policy presentation on June 11.
Providing shelter has never had the goal of solving all the problems, even those serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find those who have survived, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her feverish boy in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
There is no shortage of clean water.”
Some residents return to their ruined homes, repatriating sunken possessions, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by the earthquake, the strength of which was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Gehrys with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of the Army Hospital Palu, where patients are provided with assistance in the open air due to constant repulsions.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled how a powerful shock shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I feel like I've been squeezed into a wall," Gerrys told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife plead for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “conducting psychological pressure” with “advertising that contains propaganda”
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper posted on four pages of a U.S. daily ad material on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid app of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to Congress, which will take place on November 6. China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the US elections, mean a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is pressure on China.
While foreign governments can place ads to boost trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington over time, under which they have already increased import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of repressive tariffs in China was intended to strike at exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had done harm to U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Branstead wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “increases the pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people’s tradition of free speech and press independence to place paid ads on the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
"In contrast to this, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the development of the Chinese economy, which causes concern, from which you can make a conclusion, that with the help of the Communist Party, you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people think about the direction of the development of the Chinese economy.
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that with the failure of Kavanaugh, Republicans are setting up female voters against themselves in the run-up to the midterm elections
As many well-known Republicans support and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy after he was charged with several counts of sexual assault, analysts warn that it could cause an unwelcome reaction ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.
Passion is rampant around this situation, and most Republicans publicly say they would like to go to the polls.
Such things cannot then simply be played back,” said Grant Rieger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, during an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday.
Rieger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, which Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona) had last-minute begun to press, would be enough to appease angry voters.
According to the Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration at the Law Committee when Republicans decided to move to the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with news website Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political observer, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say that’s the case now, and it’s true.
However, the motivation may increase, especially for women voters aged 18-29 from the suburbs who have not yet decided and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the allegations of the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge in a sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative reaction from voters if Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As the director of Priorities USA (the group that helps the Democrats in the election campaign) Guy Cecile noted in an interview with the news channel, "it's not about the vote of the committee, the final vote or the fact that Kavanaugh was on the bench of the defendants, and the way they were holed up."
However, Americans' opinions about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, are divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent of respondents believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents noted that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or probably gave false testimony, while about Ford said the same thing 30% of respondents.
According to The Guardian, after the insistence of the FBI, Flayke conducts a review of the charges put forward by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while in a state of alcoholic intoxication when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge showed her her genitalia at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the world legend of technology, Inrupt, is developing a platform with open source Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to give access to this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current affairs lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify in the same browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online data storage is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “expanding personal capabilities through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company aims to use resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own stand-alone applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google on whether to make a full replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and the ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the time of Inrupt’s launch, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebration of the dedication of the representative of the Church of the Order of the Cross of Victoria in the years of the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for his participation in the fighting during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann received the award for his participation in the attack under Belangliz and Leokour on 29 September 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never found out that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion across the St. Caten Canal "through a very thick fog and under dense fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later he hurried to the firing line and with "desperate courage" led the line forward, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather had done something he would never be able to repeat himself and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very proud to be taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero demonstrates the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead showed them "Pepp's Pig"
Imagine that you are not sleeping all night, just to watch the eventful Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to view the main event.
The San Jose tournament featured 13 fights, including six main program matches, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Geghard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were about to join the fight, television viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some viewers were not thrilled by this, as they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "somewhat a failed joke".
“According to the government’s ruling, content that aired at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release a children’s show,” Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at Bellator, said when asked about the show.
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on the broadcast schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about re-broadcasting, we’ll be able to arrange it,” Cooker said.
“But now it’s Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can’t do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to fix it.
However, it turned out that this was a non-compliance with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five battles instead of six, as usual. We tried to redirect the signal for fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" than others because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley’s Olympic jump into the water tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone looks like him” until he went to high school.
Taking part in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he openly spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that due to paternity, he became less concerned with winning the Olympic Games.
The leader, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
Coming as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "worse" than others in childhood because "society didn't perceive when someone liked boys and girls."
He said: “Until then, the feeling of inferiority and difference was precisely what gave me the strength and strength to succeed.”
According to him, he wanted to prove that something "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a well-known champion for LGBT rights and took advantage of the appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke candidly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that the feelings for the man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, became a real surprise for him.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find anyone of his age who would also survive such ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to Daley, his "worldview" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I’d only think about getting gold,” he said.
“You know, there are things much more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not come to terms with the thought of the end and, before his death, asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to sit in the front row because you’re not going to be around anymore,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that was what I had been dreaming of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that,” he said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
The program Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. in English daylight saving time.
On Saturday from the match of the tournament for the Ryder Cup was brought out Mikkelson, who was not fit
American Phil Michelson set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he must restore form so that this event does not become unlucky for him.
Mikelson, who for the record 12th time participates in the tournament, which takes place every two years, was taken out of the game by Captain Jim Furick for the time of the forbols and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did when playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day long and trained in the side, hoping to master the emotions.
Because Michelson was not famous for hitting, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suited for the challenging Le Golf National golf course, where the raff usually punishes for stray shots.
And if the field is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mikkelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact stroke Francesco Molinari, who in pairs with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans, who lag behind by three points after 12 singles matches, start well, the match of Mikkelson can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, he had nothing else to add.
“He understood his role to the end today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has no doubts about his abilities.
Mikelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more games, but it worked out, and so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, on the field, like everyone else.”
If Mikkelson makes it to the field on Saturday, he will beat Nick Faldo, who played the most games in the Ryder Cup.
On this, he may have finished his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
At the expense of Mikkelson, 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furik said his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
“He’s funny, he’s greedy, he’s playful, he likes to joke with others, he’s a guy that’s great to have on the team,” Furik said.
"I think the younger players had a good time catching up with him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
Captain of the European team Thomas Byorn knows that the big break does not solve anything
Thomas Byorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a noticeable gap in front of the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not yet guarantee victory.
The Dutchman made his debut in 1997 in a match on the field of the Valderrama club, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros beat the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight margin with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the game on the Valderrami field; a big gap in Brooklyn where we lost, and on the Valderrami field where we won violently,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said after reviewing the winning Class 2018 games with a score of 5:3 on Friday, the Nationals standings.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been decided yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum return.
Go out into the field and do whatever it takes.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the board.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we’re aiming for.
As I said before, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are well aware of who is up against us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players’ performance on a challenging field, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I’ll never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things could turn out differently.
Tomorrow we are going to have individual matches, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with your partner when things are going well, but just when you’re standing there alone, and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the verge of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he’s capable of.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furick expects from his partners the best game on the individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spath and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furik himself, fate returned on the last day by different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when the team from Europe created the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every swear word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Krenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized the players before the final day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone’s side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
“We’ve put the players on the team appropriately, so it’s like we’re going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned to try to lead the counteroffensive in the top game against Rory McIlroy. Then in the first half of the list of European teams were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“It’s these partners that I’ve chosen, and in that order, because I want to share the effort evenly throughout the game,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said in a statement.
The entry into force of the new German warship again postponed
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was supposed to enter into force in 2014 instead of the outdated warships of the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and rapid growth of spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, obtained from a military spokesman, the entry into force of the ship "Reinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg", postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery hampered the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to be replaced by the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical support. It is expected that the new frigates will be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that due to the constant delays, modern warships, which were supposed to strengthen Germany's military capacity at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when German naval forces officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of a return of a military ship to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "defects of software and equipment", due to which the battleship became unsuitable for military operations.
Disadvantages of the software are especially important, since the crew of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ship consists of about 120 sailors – this is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which worsens its operational characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
The problems of obtaining new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of the naval forces of Germany.
Earlier this year, Bundestag Commissioner for Armed Forces Hans-Peter Bartels said that the country's Navy "remained a small number of ships suitable for combat tasks".
The official said that the situation was rapidly deteriorating over a certain period of time, as the old vessels were decommissioned and the new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to replenish the Navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being carried out on land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the obtained data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals, so that in the future they can take measures to save them.
In the gardens of Inverness in West Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as the dwarf bat and the pygmy bat, as well as the ears of the common and watery night.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on the land holding territory to monitor the behaviour of the bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and affiliation of bat cries.
It is then planned to develop a detailed animal habitat map and prepare a report to link the behavior of animals with the environment of their habitat.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental management measures (e.g. grassland formation) and identify optimal forest conservation methods for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the population of bats has declined significantly in Scotland and the UK.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of their nesting places.
Among other negative factors – wind installations and lighting, glue paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
They're not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, the ears help them to catch prey more effectively than the eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspections of nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
By the efforts of the organization, even the first and only in Scotland reserve for bats has been created. It is located on the territory of the Triv site in the area of Dumfries and Galloway. It has found shelter to eight of the ten species of bats living in Scotland.
The site manager David Thompson claims that this is the perfect place for them.
"On the territory of the Triv site, excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
“There are old buildings, a lot of giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research we do here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of bats before carrying out any technical work, because due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the removal of the young can kill up to 400 females with infants, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire site.
Puppies and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organisation's efforts.
She said, "We still need to know a lot about our bats. We have not yet revealed the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charge a “clash” and said people are “trying to get attention” using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspects.
The American Catherine Mayorga accused the forward of the national team of Portugal and the football club "Juventus" of rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As reported by Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the indictment, the 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the relevant messages "a slap."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are an insult," the five-time Golden Ball owner made such a statement on camera.
“They want to attract attention by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” added the footballer, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called "an inadmissible report of suspicion in the field of private life."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral harm to the extent that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most vocal cases of personal rights violations in recent years".
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 in a room of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal. Such evidence was submitted to the district court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who had "one percent."
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police, and then to the hospital, where the injuries she received were photographed. However, she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, as she was "fearing of revenge" and warned of "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman is seeking to cancel a pre-agreement as she continues to suffer from an incident that she said took place.
At the time of this incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to Real Madrid FC from Manchester United. This summer, he became a player of the Italian football team, Juventus, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of automakers
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses the status of a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit. This is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was excited by a statement from Toyota UK representatives, who told BBC reporters that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and operation of its plant in Bernastone, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernastone, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if Britain leaves the EU in an emergency at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Bernastone.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the UK’s exit from the EU without a deal on international trade.
For example, BMW has said that the production plant for the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in the mode of prompt delivery of parts and materials according to needs – parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruptions in the supply of parts at the border, leading to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, in the Toyota warehouse you can place parts for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in the plan for the organization of relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "there are separate schemes for the avoidance of problems at the border."
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal that, in my opinion, will allow us not only to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Given the evidence from Toyota and other automakers, we still need to maintain our high-performance supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will stop, but in the long term, they expect that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will cause jobs to be reduced.
Peter Tsuvalaris, head of the organizing committee of the Unite trade union at the plant in Bernastone, which has worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned: “From experience, I can say that the reduced jobs are not being restored.”
A government official said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for the formation of our future relations with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
White House officials said Sunday that a responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as discussions continue over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For several months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of the release of the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about using microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president's powers under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't" like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid collusion over time with a Senate Legal Committee meeting at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Fordley, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not set. It may be held this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly watching to see that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the leader, asked why.
Sanders responded that the rare briefings were not related to an aversion to "playing in public" by television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing in public."
Then she suggested that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president does to him,” she said, adding without citing a source: “Statistics speaks for itself.”
Sanders said the briefings would still be held, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try to communicate with the press often. This should have been especially noticeable over the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with the participation of high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, behaving in front of journalists in a frantic and sometimes snarky way.
Scotland's Secretary of State for Health has addressed a letter to EU workers in connection with concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed in a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express gratitude for their work and ask for its continuation after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of Scotland’s parliament, sent the letter less than six months before Britain’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made commitments to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman said: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit have continued during the summer. Appropriate decisions should be expected this autumn.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this can be a very stressful time for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and countries outside it share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health service for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay."
Christie Ebercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Kristion Ebercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost by 31:27. This was reported by Tennesse newspaper.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the break.
“He went to the sideline where he got sick,” Reid said.
Along the sideline, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before picking it up on stretchers for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence yet of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers are trying to find out when the player received the injury.
Ebercrombie, a freshman, spent his first season in the Tennessee State Tigers after transitioning from the Illinois team.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before being knocked out of the game. So for the season he has a score of 18 interceptions.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in the event of the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new plans of Tori, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts by Corbin to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more tolls. Additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing aimed at high-paid workers.
The increase in the duty will apply to individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds are being directed by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
The additional duty, which is accompanied by an increase in the two-year-old age for second homes and real estate intended for rental, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of new real estate, which is being built in London, is owned by foreign citizens. This leads to higher prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of own housing.
Many rich areas of the country, in particular, in the capital, are deserted, as a large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in government tariffs to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without further use. He called on Theresa May to abandon quotas on affordable real estate to correct the "disgraceful situation in the housing market" in the UK.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the field of real estate, including the control of rent and the impossibility of eviction without serious grounds.
It also proposes to extend the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: "Toric I promised to dedicate my premiership to the restoration of the British dream - for every new generation life must be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it cannot be called fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of own housing has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air is still very painful."
Jack Ross: ‘I want to be the head coach of Scotland’
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross has said he wants to lead Scotland's national team "above all".
The 42-year-old Scotsman set out to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning FC St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I made it to Scotland’s second team, but it’s over,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland radio.
“When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the Scottish national team play at the Hempden Park stadium. It always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful as the head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland FC, in particular, were Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former head coach of FC "Alloa Athletic" claims that he did not feel the excitement of moving to a large club followed by such authoritative names, having previously rejected offers from FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"At the current stage, I think that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club undoubtedly corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task, but I’m unlikely to see any other result as a success.”
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Prior to that, he worked as a second coach at Dumbarton FC, and also spent 15 months at Garts FC's coaching staff.
He then helped the Alloa recover after the F.C. got to the third division, and the following season with St. Mirren went from the departure stage to winning the title of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was at a crossroads," he recalls, referring to the transition to Alloa FC.
“I honestly believed that the coaching activity was more suited to me than the game.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, not bad at it earned and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are a lot of challenges that need to be overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but in the role of head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching work. I have never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life as after I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time for a beer
The summer heat has helped to increase revenue for British pubs, which are experiencing not the best times, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
According to the calculations, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations Peter Martin of the organization CGA, which is engaged in business development consulting, noted: "Due to the sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championship, July passed by the same scheme as the previous month, when the restaurant was out.
The June drop of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars, focused on serving drinks, so far have the best indicators – the growth of their profits is equal to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs serving food were also affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages for the month increased by 6.6%. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM’s licensing and hotel business division, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors influencing sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual fall in sales by 4.8% causes special concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
A long hot summer has not come at the best time for establishments serving food. We will see if the milder temperature we observed in August will be able to give them such a necessary rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, in July amounted to 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of new brands.
The industry volume indicator of sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector of the UK is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds 9 billion pounds. This is the generally accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
According to the results of the study, every fifth child, sometimes not older than 11 years, has a hidden account from parents and teachers in social networks
A study that covered 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a “basic account” showing their parents
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, creates a social media account that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean “basic” account that they show to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who happened to come across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw there the call “rape me”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eileen Doyle to be ‘representative of athlete interests’ at Scottish Athletics Council
Eileen Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general board meetings.
Doyle is Scotland’s most talented athlete. The head of the council, Jen Beatty, called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its wide-ranging experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilead has great respect among the athletes of Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by involving her in the council, athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously,” Bitty said.
Doyle said: “I’ll be inspired to act as an athlete’s advocate. I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now a sports observer for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I perform dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!”
In the advertising of the milk extractor women were compared with cows – the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of vacuum cleaners has encountered an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to actual cows.
To mark the release of the product, dubbed “the world’s first silent breast milk extractor,” consumer goods technology company Elvie has released a humorous music video-style ad to showcase the freedom provided to mothers by the new extractor.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled cow under the song, which contains the words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see, it's not my belly, it's my breasts."
Then the choir sings: "Suck, suck, to feed the children. Suck, suck, so that the milk does not waste."
However, the commercial, published on the company’s Facebook page, caused a stormy discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
The Elvie Milk Absorber can be easily hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here is another comment: "It is clear that this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them to advertise a sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Another added: “This ad is very far from reality.”
Other users spoke out for the protection of the commercial. One of the women video seemed "very cheerful".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would certainly buy such a thing if I was still breastfeeding.
When I sucked in the milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I wasn’t looking for hidden content in it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Some advertising focused on moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not intended to cover the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women demonstrate the milk suction cups hidden in their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie suction cup works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in the bra for feeding. Thanks to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: “The Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Having drawn a parallel between women who squeeze milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way, demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that a new suction cup will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie has been featured in the news headlines.
As part of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while showing clothes from fashion designer Marta Yakubovska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have complicated the process of placing children in foster care.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caretakers were the undocumented immigrants themselves. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that Bureau employees had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of people who are carers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who committed crimes.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people,” said Mr. Albans.
According to asylum workers, in order to speed up child cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as was previously the case.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of going to court in person to prove their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who by the decision of the court do not have the right to receive asylum, will be quickly deported.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression. This can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights defenders argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Torniello, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk exacerbating the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In addition, speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so “taking them will be appropriate.”
“They should leave immediately and not make conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terror is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have left their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
Regarding refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" that refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help people return,” he said.
“We are witnessing an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union are warning that they will not help Syria rebuild the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive of the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has “clear terms” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front militants, who “will be destroyed.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem put the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
Under this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he would not be able to make up his powers ahead of time after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be “the most dramatic end to the presidency in all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on cable channel MSNBC was at the top of the rating with 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our comprehension,” Neil Burr, executive producer of the drama “The Last Candidate,” told ABC about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humor writer and author of Just Funny Moments: As well as a few harsh truths about penetrating a club of Hollywood men, offers a different theory.
She recalled a ride in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is amusing.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, the stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Rowe's case against Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Disposal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can’t say that you’re just trying to stay informed citizens when you’ve been watching the Post for six hours as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “well-informed” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s jacket from the ostrich’s skin for $15,000.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The sense of reality is partly due to the fact that you are getting something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the television program "Stars of the Lombard", about the rotation in the cast and the daily plot of the film.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can be hopelessly behind.
When I managed to meet Mr. Flays this week at his home on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV – not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I took it as a joke, but it seems they were right.”

External infusions of funds into the toughest midterm elections in Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of the state of Pennsylvania, additional money infusions are directed, because through the review of the boundaries of the electoral districts, two current congressmen compete for one seat.
The fight for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, is joined by Democrat, Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb confronts another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn in favor of Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The pre-election races in the new 17th district sparked a fierce confrontation between the major party finance units, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the National Republican Party Committee (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very popular in Pennsylvania after winning the 18th district with minimal advantage during the additional congressional elections in March, which enjoyed wide public attention.
This place belonged to Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador with the support of China, but changed their mind
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners expelled from there the staff hired by the company Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," the department's press secretary, Heather Neuert, said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular, in the field of drug control, as well as in the framework of supporting social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and homicide.
According to the results of the internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity. A similar event took place last year, and it was considered a step forward in the efforts aimed at keeping the flow in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking representatives of the administration made it clear that they want the conference to take place. In fact, on this consideration, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A representative of Mr. Bolton in the White House declined to comment on details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next nuisance could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, a strong confirmation of why it can be found in the public information now available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly investigating a possible link between the Trump campaign and an attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress passes into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congress, as well as to voters and, ultimately, to one-party parties.
There’s a lot of “ifs” in this case, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West had begun to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the ability to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by such turning points, and the unstoppable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now facing a number of such perturbations.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein was caught in the crosshairs when information appeared in this newspaper that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on Trump’s inconsistency with the post.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How do we respond if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s case, which has recently been initiated by the FBI, turns out to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court is upheld despite compelling allegations of sexual harassment and misdemeanors?
And, above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Saturday candles on the swastika table.
Having such a legacy, can I not look forward to the future with optimism?”

Grem Dorrans from Rangers optimistically awaits the meeting with the Vienna "Rapid"
Rangers FC will host Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in the game with Villarreal at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance to leave the Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time of the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“For us it was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We came out in the game with the hope of getting something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match we could go forward, but in general nobody can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was the best, but after a break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, was a difficult one, starting with my injuries and ending with the changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great lineup, and all the guys are satisfied. Training is going well.
I hope we can go further, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep because of fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few spoke about it with members of their family.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not in a hurry to have a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
Here’s what you need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need unless you tell your relatives in advance.
Consult with your consultant and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise on how to cover the relevant expenses.
Sources of long-term care funding include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-insurance at your own expense (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal friction in advance.
Prepare the authority for your representative who will monitor your medical care and make sure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can not do it in person.
In addition, we advise you to issue a power of attorney for the disposal of funds.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in the event of your incapacity.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical attention, so he will be taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down this information to be ready.
"It's not just about finances. It's about who the doctors are," says Martin, "
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog.
Make a plan like that.”
In Ilfracum, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several times from a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m. British daylight saving time, as a “coincidence.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds do not pose a threat to his life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, state officials said, but the number of victims may rise.
Due to the out of order of the means of communication, officials engaged in the provision of humanitarian assistance, can not receive any information from the regency of Dongala, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 points.
After the natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some basic facts about the city of Palu and the Dongala Regency located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people, according to data for 2017.
When there was an earthquake that caused a tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to data for 2017, approximately 299,200 people live in the Regency, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters over the last 100 years, Palu and Dongala have been affected by the tsunami several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes were destroyed in a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom are from Aceh.

The eldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Trace Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Paelin from Vassilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing a report of a case of violence and resisting time.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna detention center with the right to deposit a security deposit of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he admits his guilt, according to the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses involving up to a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offences, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing a report of a domestic violence case and carrying a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups for justifying her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused a tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power grids are out of order, and the number of victims may rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, which spreads on social networks, shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov, driving a Home Depot pickup truck, took a bike path along a highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to beat down cyclists and pedestrians who happened to be on his way.
According to a report on the intention to seek a death sentence filed in the Southern District of New York State to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, each of these charges provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of demanding, which are usually filed by federal prosecutors in cases related to organized crime, as well as convictions for felonies.
According to prosecutors, who described Saipov’s crime as “terrible, cruel and malicious,” the attack was the result of “careful planning and premeditated intent.”
Victims with whom Sayfulla Habibullaevich Saipov inflicted injuries, caused damage or killed by Diogenes Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadett, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Erna Erruth
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time a criminal case was brought in the Southern District of New York, which is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was carried out in New York in 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by an attack on an ISIS video he was watching on his phone.
Police say he has also asked to display the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “very disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting acquittal and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only exacerbate the psychological trauma caused by these events to all those affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defence party had earlier also asked the defendants not to seek the death penalty.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party believes that Nigel Farage should be appointed responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Congress of the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, as one of the MPs Theresa May proposed her candidacy for talks with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would have come out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
The attention to the problems that May faced, trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks, was further attracted by the fact that the Conservative Party MPs, who oppose the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon the attempt to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and “chaos”.
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr. Bone said he wanted to “give up the Chequers.”
He invited Mr Farage to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible for this, we would have already come out,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in world wars not in order to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that after the 2016 vote public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British changed their mind and did not want to leave is absolutely not true."
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who are actually walking the streets and fighting for the votes of voters.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.”
In an appeal to Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their positions when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage said politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a question of trust between us, the people and our political elite," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Conservatives Against Brexit” banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the fact that after the opening of the conference due to their party program there were security problems.
“These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think seriously” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would “seriously consider running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that during a general meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts told about its future.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in November for a second term against Republican Party member Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is considered as the main candidate that can cope with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that “it’s time for women to go to Washington and set up government jobs, and for that, a woman should be in charge.”
Arrested suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Sims with a firearm
The Baton Rouge Police Department, Louisiana, said on Saturday that Weid Sims, the LSU Tigers basketball player suspected of murdering a firearm, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
“Vade Sims was shot in the head and died as a result,” Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade gave in to his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was established that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches and who played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and averaged 17.4 minutes per game on the field, scored 5.6 points and 2.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reduced his lag in the fight for the title of world champion after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Waltery Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start from the pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to maintain his position on the first two laps and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track at the tail of the race, which had everything to decide.
The driver of the Mercedes team drove another lap and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton broke out in front of the leader after a certain maneuver wheel to wheel, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior space due to the risk that he would get stuck, after the result in the under.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race as he did not change the tyres to quickly reach the finish line and shift Kimi Raikkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped at the pit stop in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace to the last eight, thanks to which Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri was teaching full time all weekend and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to ride.
The team has done an exceptional job to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
The body language wasn't impressed.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm position that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion about the events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated human "inferiority, ugliness and deceit."
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see evil people showing meanness, ugliness and lying,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the information being released, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... Did you disclose the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t announce it.”
Wait a minute.
We did?... No, we didn’t,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Feynstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh, and in early September its contents were released, but Feynstein denied that the leak occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not disclose the information obtained from her,” Feynstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break my promises.”
However, her denial did not seem to please the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you, the language of her body was not at all impressive.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but I haven’t seen anyone hold up any worse.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women were accused of sexual violence, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power in any necessary way.
You see meanness, ugliness, they don’t care who you hurt, who you have to go through to get power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3
"Jiants" player Patrick Dwyer threw two washes in the match against "Dandy"
The Dandy Stars have been rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league of the Belfast Giants, winning the match-response on Saturday with a score of 5:3.
The Giants got an early lead in two washes thanks to the throws of Patrick Dwyer and Frances Bowie.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equalized the score in the home game, and then Dwayne again brought the Giants forward.
The player "Dandy" Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar equalized the score, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of the elite league team Adam Keef, who won a free-kick over the Dandi with a 2:1 score on Friday evening in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season. The Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer threw the first washer in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall's transfer, and four minutes later Bowie, who received the washer from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period at the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the field masters to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Coney, having received a wash from Matt Markwardt, equalized the score.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, dropping his second wash at the end of the first period.
The field masters regrouped, and Bushar again equalized the score for the twenty-eighth minute (27:37), dropping the score as his team outnumbered.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen, at the end of the second period, he first brought the Dandy forward and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will play a away game against Milton Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was named a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a massive tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground tremors continue to shake the area, many people found themselves under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily-worn control tower at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufra airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, rose safely into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider, Johannes Syreit, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is supposed to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
“We are very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims may increase as many bodies are still under fragments, and many of them cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver aid and food.
Reza Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
There is no shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane fell into the lagoon one man disappeared
The airline, which was carrying out the flight that suffered a disaster in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person has gone missing, although earlier it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said it could not find a single passenger as of Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and for this purpose cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses believe that the plane flew the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to pass through the emergency exits on the sinking plane by being belted in the water.
He said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he had received a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to modernize the berth also helped in the rescue operation, taking people to shore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in plane crashes involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini is not included in this list.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to recreate the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had been with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claim.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers's death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wipes her out of his life,” Gail said.
The defense must make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
Three hip-hop artists want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has abandoned political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit for the couple for release, receiving a "racist" message
In New York City, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit with the "excuse".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who came on her first working day in 2016, was black.
"NO, ONE MORE DARKNESS," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him Miss Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "inconvenient" and fired Ms. Morris. She stated that their previous nanny, who was an African American, did not do her job well and that instead she was expecting a nanny from Fpee.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple, hoping to receive compensation for the release in the amount of the salary she would have received in six months of living with the spouse she was originally hired to work for, albeit without a contract. She was to be paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to allegations that they were racists, the couple said Morris’s release was a wise decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a man you treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
NAVYAD".
Comparing the lawsuit to the “excuse,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and “hasn’t recovered yet.”
Would you take revenge on someone like that?
It’s a bad thing,” added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, a court of public opinion quickly condemned the pair on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As reported in the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear that could speak.
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to be printed, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
Now that’s funny, because we know about the huge success that the Padangton story has had.”
Talking about the fact that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic that his work was rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time she felt "joy and sadness".
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a pretty modest man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not theirs, and not our victories.
I think he looked at Padington's success that way.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to 2 Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
“I called over regularly, said it was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“And then Nad called me and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.”
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating, gradually stopped working and went out of the body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold my hand.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was burning because of the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not paying attention to the severe tests she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who have suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave postcards on the Welsh bridge with phone numbers that people can contact for support, as well as messages that would ask to inspire them.
Ms. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he put his hands on himself.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lidna, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that this smile would make any room brighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body after he put his hands on himself.
Miss Davis says, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have consequences.”
Miss Davis created the postcards, "so people know there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
“Don’t shut up, you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed.”
And on Christmas Day, he was completely absorbed in the spirit. When the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge injury for them, but they had to survive it: "It imposed a devastating
Follow the family.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – limited in time and nature of the investigation – we might have reached a certain agreement,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disband” amid a loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to time.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person through elections to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush telephoned senators asking to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to get at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's rule, the number of defectors from North Korea "declined"
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Pak Pyeong Seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said the number of defectors last year was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors were the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers transporting illegals now demand more money for it.
In Pyongyang, they refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations on which have come to a standstill.
This came after a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not making progress since.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yong-Ho said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nominee “hysterical” and said he was temperamentally unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I’ve always thought that if a woman ever acted in this way, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation" by organized liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his biased attitude toward the Democrats.
"I think with these statements, and his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he's going to do his own bidding," she said.
Pelosi was outraged when she was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his guilt was confirmed, and if Democrats would get a majority in the House.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not suitable not only for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearing on the question of approval in the post, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he cancels some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the judge becomes hysterical, biased and we will say how great it is," Pelosi said.
Women need to own these weapons.
These were just words that contained months and years of anger accumulated in them, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: “A woman who worked as an executive and helped me out a lot said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she had her own method. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor: ‘You might think I’m sad and that’s why I’m crying.
I am evil.”
And then she just continued.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered a permissible way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of the first job in the office, where mostly men worked, was the situation when one day I cried from unspeakable anger, and the older woman – an unfriendly manager, which I was always a little afraid of – grabbed me by the collar and pulled me to the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got to you.”
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Ms. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already taken part in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed.”
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she made a promise to herself that she would not participate in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not spare the men’s support of $1,000, gave her only $250.
“They think they’re going to give me a discount?” she asked.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not be running an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and forced to focus not so much on voters as on members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as sexism.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How a U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war were desperate, and, although far from complete, in the long term, the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest situation this week was exacerbated by new tariffs on goods worth a total of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been paying back the same coin each time, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar U.S. action, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to deliver on that promise anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means agreeing to the demands, but for China’s President Xi Jinping, US public worship is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes the right advantage of the situation, the pressure in the trade war with the United States may bring China an advantage in the long term, reducing the interrelationship between the two economies.
“A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And that actually poses a greater threat than observers have acknowledged before,” said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for Asian Security.
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Repatriate Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to restore a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be happy to accept assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they will not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support the coup.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when they defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who tried hard for most of the tournament, punched his first long shot on the 16th hole par-3 in the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of only four players ever to score 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a 5:4 loss from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbjerna Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks first in the world rankings, conceded a 2:1 score to Jan Poulter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament last.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cup who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who won the most times in tournaments in all time, bringing in 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to return the cup.
It’s a credit to the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said, without holding back his emotions after winning in Europe.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Remus, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2:1 singles match.
“I’m incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record of 13–21–3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, inferior only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried to reach the Fervey area all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said of his team after a disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’ll regroup, I’ll work with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we’ll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We cannot fail to praise them.
We lost."
Up-to-date information on the red tide: reduction in concentration in Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife indicates a general decline in the level of blooming of red microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
