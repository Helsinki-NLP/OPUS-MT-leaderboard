Parliament does not support the amendment giving freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, in the course of the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, the Parliament of Ukraine rejected an attempt to repeal an article according to which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the easing of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia that was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political vendetta of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
The Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert. Without him, the war ended.
It’s time to identify the winners.
As a rule, the country is won by Islamists; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself to be a follower of the customary Sharia law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the penalty for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind, nor the best, nor would it be likely to suit, for example, the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only excuse is that, in their opinion, NATO’s raids were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of "crusaders".
Although without occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold for virtually nothing?
And the West will finally be able to cling to the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of the Shari'ah put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a stalemate, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; now they have focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by an expected 0.5%; France’s by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany's business was doing better than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (the original information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was at a standstill. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a stalemate compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts’ forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The profitability of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are starting to experience difficulties.
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech national team was selected in Euro.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully tackled the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Peter Yiracek, they won with a score of 1: 0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after a home-response match, and she will once again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and prepared a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiracek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the release of the European Championship.
Excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vucini<0xC4><0x87> became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two magnificent opportunities.
The magnificent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game was played in the center of the field for most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of hosts in the first half. Long-range strikes behind the line of defense were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they wish to express their support for their country’s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, prayers for students before entering the building were followed by a prayer for the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country’s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that there is evidence that Iran has not abandoned attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, prayers for students before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer for the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Diet for children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than normal; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families leading an unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and patterns of behavior that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is no coincidence.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports. This, however, applies to most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year, involving almost 900 primary school students across Bohemia.
The event Obesity - it is not an accident was held for the second year in a row, with the support of insurance company V<0xC5><0xA1>eobecn<0xC3><0xA1> zdravotn<0xC3><0xAD> poji<0xC5><0xA1>t'ovna and company Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they eat five times a day, according to the breakfast-recommended-lunch-recommended-lunch-dinner scheme, and this is one of the essential conditions for proper nutrition,” says one of the study’s findings.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the constant time of a family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst finding is that in every tenth family, people don’t eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study found that fried foods were more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children play sports regularly, this figure is more than doubled – to 15% – when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
“The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks,” the study concludes.
As the main dinner dish, the pasta beat the bird with a small overhang.
However, the children showed almost no interest in bean, fish and vegetable dishes.
Striving for a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study’s control group demonstrated a significant shift in preferences toward healthy eating when they filled out a questionnaire after completing a lecture Obesity is not an accident,” the project said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet soft drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children were more likely to celebrate poultry and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about trainings for stylists, I visited the volume of information at introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; tips on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
Further, more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training is held every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there are no men on the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a male figure without proper forms, another weighs more than the norm.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, i.e., owners of a more lush chest and thighs and a narrow waist, and not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and hips is so large that you can not pick up a skirt or pants, you should have at least one thing sewn to order.
You will obviously not regret the funds invested, because perfectly sitting clothes are priceless.
In a skirt sewn to order, you will feel much better than in the one that constantly goes off, rolls, undresses the waist, etc.
Owners of boys' figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffles, application, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I’m glad I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid, it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant of the courses had to come up with two outfits for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, who you might know from Victoria's Secret ad campaigns.
I’m happy for myself because it’s so much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently made a ton of improvements (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphic programs.
Mudboard - so called the result of work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic component of the style.
The stylist does not just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
The stylist needs a general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was brought to life by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, on top of jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without cuffs, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image completely changes.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work you should know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," Jacob told us.
Here I have finally understood why we are brushing up on all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more outfit options on hand than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the subject of clothing often looks and works in combination with others, not at all like in reality.
We must keep this in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style is half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have a stunning vocal, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider this superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and the way they look - secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they really wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about what some celebrity was up to / losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, Gonza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for the stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up the outfit.
Our job is mainly to communicate with the people we dress; that’s why it’s important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to appreciate people, not to indulge them and to stick to their opinion.
“If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us what a working bag should specifically fit.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should be a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, for example, a bag or hat), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too big for them (shoes are too big for them)
To distract from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned how to make the correct lining on the soles of the shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged — not to mention shooting on the street.
And here we go with the sticker.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to spoil them.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I didn’t like these skills.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t as easy as anyone might say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambitions have been met to some extent, but it doesn’t matter, as no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Escape" had high hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a worthy place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs away.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression spoils a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
And so, in reality, these are not mistakes, but the manifestation of the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story whose protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to be the first to get to New York.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes on its route, separate stages are held in a diverse and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to look at.
But the game doesn’t have strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time brings to life an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandstorm, significantly reducing visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overtake several rivals (essentially a regular race); then you try to improve the time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you compete with one opponent.
Among other things, you come across the police from time to time, which makes your task even more complicated.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (just three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because this property doesn’t get bored; given all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you’re looking for a real-life imitation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although you can find better options on the market.
So far so good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game you do not expect complex transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before a collision with an object, how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, overtaking or passing machines in a dense flow, you sometimes slightly touch another machine. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation your machine begins to spin furiously.
Or the shards broke.
This is not so important thanks to the restart system, but it is enough to spoil the fun.
Reboots are arranged so that if you break or go far away from the track, the game takes you back to the point where it broke.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn a separate section of the race on your own.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go a certain way, otherwise you just won’t fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a specific location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is especially irritating in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you either need to move them around or slow down.
It doesn’t matter when you’re around them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand in front of you no matter what.
The fact is that when he drives in front of you, he makes you look worse, which leads to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
Too bad, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so full of events that you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what makes you miss out – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gas stations along the way, as it is on them your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode of the story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual sections that you will learn over the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points, common for challenges and story modes.
Many opportunities are available to achieve a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results achieved by you with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here is another drawback that is difficult to understand; it is an example from the last race in a sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (we'll assume that's the case) where you race on the tracks in the dark (we'll assume that's the case).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we’ll assume so) when a subway train suddenly hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
Over the course of a few days, our editors discussed whether no one really thought for a second at the time of creating the game, or whether its creators really consider us such fools.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video series is for the most part pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that in some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This is especially true for events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you much either.
Sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack 'entered compositions of different styles'; but hardly many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite messy.
If the game were to avoid obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Sure, it’s good fun, but be prepared for the drawbacks that will blind you as an airport projector.

Ambassador to the EU VICENOVA:
The Czechs have a reputation of malcontents and skeptics towards the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreements between individual organisations."
“I didn’t expect such a brutal war.”
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adheres to her “Clearly and openly about Europe” motto in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the University of Kyiv would envy.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse who couldn’t perform any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role.”
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven countries at the same time, communicate with them perfectly and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security issues as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova went on to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, present and the near future.
She called the Czech Republic’s presidency successful last year.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized an Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon, causing considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
At present, the Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the Presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing turmoil.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support, and which will receive less; all these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "About Europe, in understandable language".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties?
It is also going to make more efficient use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organisations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech Presidency, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad Group again?' and he's not happy about it.'
In the future, the Union of Vicenov expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the states parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t can stay on the sidelines.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
History of the brand:
The IBM innovator enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was established by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many world problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant revolved (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, though not afraid to change everything around it.
For the first 100 years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
For the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” says Samuel J. Palmizano, the company’s current CEO on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care in the same way as Bata in the Czech Republic – IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, an elegant uniform and a sophisticated bonus system for the best inventors.
The same is true of IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application to talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world that eliminated all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizzano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has been organizing meetings, online brainstorming sessions, during which many future innovations are emerging.
Not surprisingly, there are many ideas - the company employs about half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
A strong position of the company in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
“From the start, from the point of view of the concept, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company,” said Rosabet Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of the book about IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Forrester Research’s Joe Coloni.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, with five of its employees receiving the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode, and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization data, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (Apple's first-place finish), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look ahead.
Not all of its products were to the liking of buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; the online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is defined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizzano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the groundwork on multiple platforms — if they don’t work, it turns them down.
This is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing drops on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s main revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with twice as much capital, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion. At the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net income has steadily increased.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
The history of IBM: from a cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computer Corporation, Tabulation, Recording" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally this was the name of the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the legendary “table clock”, i.e. the clocks that record the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also headed the board of trustees of the company.
Flint hired the director of a rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the head pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows – Watson’s ideas remain the foundation of an unshakable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started with the production and sale of various business equipment – from cheese knives and meat cuts to cash registers.
Over the first four years of Watson’s management, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company began a massive expansion across all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly forty years later, his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took his place in the CEO’s chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both employees and IBM computers helped NASA control spaceflights — to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 — a human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM Line System/360.
The classic PC that set the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing business to Chinese company Lenovo, while simultaneously acquiring the consulting division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businesses control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague, where there is also a world-class research group dedicated to speech recognition.
Richtarzhova about her unfaithful husband:
Yvette, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarzh (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rykhtarzhova explained.
When Darina Rikhtarzhova gave Bartoshova her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave R<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He has publicly admitted that he loves her.
After a while, Darina surrendered, pretending to have reconciled with her husband's novel; and now finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarzh and Bartoshov ever part, his wife will not accept him with open arms.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out.”
“However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but the person with whom something connects me,” said Rikhtarzhova, adding that she has already got rid of her husband and insists only on mutual similarities.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union is still functioning; I am in charge of repair, gardening, home and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, but we don’t share a bed anymore,” Richtarge told Blesk.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with it.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes or who she has a friend with.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I have full responsibility,” he said.
The Worst Women’s Habits: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing a few female habits that make men angry?
SHOPPING
Your other half complains that you constantly go shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, which of you will refuse to walk around the clothes stores in search of perfectly sitting clothes and try it (preferably, in different color options) in sample?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can become a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
Eternal Discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
- Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to a partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more often such complaints arise, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Washing glass, cleaning with vacuum cleaner, floor washing, dusting, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean cafe in dirty shoes; kids for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that falling into extremes is not good; and that in your family order and purity should not stand in the first place.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as the whole family.
Striving to command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood this, women would not have to command them so often...
Spletni
Some women like to gossip, insult, and plot against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, each of us is probably breaking up the gossip.
Let’s be honest, this is the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women’s work collective, pose a great danger to their environment.
Jagra and Vorachek's successful transfers helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey striker Jaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the Carolina ice. He again became the most successful Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giraud used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to the player in the same team with Yagra Yakubu Vorachek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Gira.
“I told him before the game that he was going to score a hat-trick.
“I felt it.”
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Jagra explained, after whose actions Gyro scored the goal at the first opportunity that Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech footprint".
The closing Harrickaines Vorachek took possession of the wash and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwayne narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but in the beginning of the second half again led the Flyers.
Especially the fat.
Following Jagra's successful serve, he scored a third goal; his shot was later converted into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely in the top three,” Yagr said, praising his centre-back.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
“It makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
“All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it’s my turn,” added Jagr.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwayne's penalty shootout, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
“Pronger did a great job in our area.”
"He hit the washer, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far end."
"I was aiming for it and I'm glad it worked," Voracek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Czech team Yaroslav Shpaczek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanets was unable to score during one of their attacks.
More than the points lost, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
“We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“Whatever it is, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to put up with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“The replacement for the replacement was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
“We needed to simplify the game, move the washer out of our zone.”
"What was our weak side," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0xBE>ej Pavelets helped Winnipeg beat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets, who broke a five-game series of defeats, were beaten by five different players.
Dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, on vacation, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was required; otherwise an individual journey was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but you either had to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have “good friends” in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A foreign exchange permit was required for travel to the West and was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit persists to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989, vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we are no longer aware of, is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular today Croatia, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the need to obtain a visa to neighboring Western European countries was abolished. This started a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at that time was not enough for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (canned food, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown. Decades later, our tourists can finally freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air travel has now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed world countries except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. Great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, happened in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Our country, thus, forever joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand kroner per person during their vacation abroad, including their spending at the destination.
The General Assembly must elect the president, the threat of the pate is coming back
For about five months, Czech football had no president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what election rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindhryh Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k are eager to lead Czech football.
Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek left his post in June. Leaving, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
However, Gashek’s era once again plunged football into a rift between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16 when it was necessary to elect a new president.
The delegates of the general assembly did not come to the National House in Prague, Smichov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting, only legal representatives or also officials who had been given powers.
This point has since been partly settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on the powers conferred is impossible.
Disputes over the election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
Voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to go to the 3rd round and avoid the duck?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or find another model,” says one of the vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for in the charter, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who received a lot of support from the chamber from which he is the candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agrees with the compromise to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the total percentage ratio, the winner must score at least two-thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of the two chambers," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pa<0xC4><0x8D>lik agrees with his opinion, although according to the estimates of the election rules defined by the charter, Pelt is more pleased than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held as strictly as possible."
“I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense, like at the previous general meeting,” says owner Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements he mostly contradicted Pelte.
Pelt is an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburk; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotional fervor will calm down after today's expected national team's exit to the European Championship."
"Football will again be on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonec. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management both at the professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
“It could cause another collapse of the general assembly.”
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate negotiations were held directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was supposed to deliver, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the venue of the replay match.
In the end, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like to see the opposing sides of the strongest sports association in the country come to an agreement.
Much has been put on the map: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new directorate of Czech sport after Sazka’s financial problems.
Pazzik enters the presidential race because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of football players Plzen Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Patzl<0xC3><0xAD>k would have seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have even claimed a high post.
“If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself.”
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Patzlik <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The motive of Patzlik for joining the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Yindrikh Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from entering the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R administration.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this position to be taken by an experienced top manager, not too involved with the football life.
“I’ve talked to a few people that you could have in mind.”
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to have anything to do with Czech football.
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
At present, the main difference between Paclik and Pelta is the latter's relationship with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berbro is a man of controversial reputation, who behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the voices of all delegates.
Pazzik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelt to become president.
“If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward.”
“With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging for football,” said Paclik.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago Pelt’s name was recorded while listening to the telephones during the corruption investigation; Pelt managed to escape sentencing.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelt’s victory would bring to football.”
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," he said. He does not now mention his previous statement that he will "sell Plzen club if Pelta becomes president".
If Patslick wins on Thursday, he could look forward to working with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would turn to."
"He's very capable."
"I can represent him at the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
“I don’t have a nose for what I don’t understand either,” said Patzlik, who drew a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Ljudek Matsela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pazzik claims he will risk running the association.
He refers to his experience of managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the Plzen team, which with his help celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"Limit the influence of some groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to abhorrent situations," said Patzlik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzetinski.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to the sport from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president should address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they have to clearly state where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with Plzen a burden, although he claims that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is connected to the Jablonec, and Reichl to the Prague Dukla.
“This is not an ideal option.”
“And yet I don’t see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares of Plzen to someone else, since I’m going to be back there in six months,” says Patzlik.
Pelta has promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will avoid the Electoral Path
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new rules of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R in order to avoid disputes over the rules of election in the future.
Before the negotiations in Nimburk on Thursday, the official of Jablonec remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election fight will be significantly distracted by today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelt promised that if he wins, he would focus on both representation and fundraising.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas regarding football in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association,” says the man, mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by euphoria, which reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
“Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general meeting in June.”
“If different ways of representation were not adopted, we would have already had a president from September,” Pelta said.
He referred to the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal responsibility, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt proves unsuccessful.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” Pelt said.
In addition, he says that he does not try to stand out against the background of rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Yindhrykh Reichl, whom he values for legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who constantly criticized Pelt.
“He’s been in football for over a year and he’s had some success.
“In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign.”
"Even so, some of them are now doubting his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is true to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent all football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the bohemian case or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“I would then focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football,” the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not result in the dismissal of the staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual employees." This was his message to Strahov, where the prolonged period of inter power causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that on Thursday delegates will come to Nimburk not in vain.
“If the only issue is how to run in the third round, we can do it.”
“Football needs the trust it can get only by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work actively
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Yindhryh Reichl, the acting vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be dissatisfied.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to introduce changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual areas in football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money into football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events.”
“I don’t want to say that I will do everything myself,” Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute authority on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I will carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments, football has taken big steps forward.”
“It’s probably not going to appeal to a lot of people because it’s going to mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know if there’s any sense in it; and that I won’t be surrounded by people putting my sticks in the wheels and questioning my every move,” he explained.
“However, many people have told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come.”
"It's a trust that I can't throw away," he said.
What’s more, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to go over that.”
“Processes have been started that can bring results in a few years, and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something that Mirek Pelt is unlikely to be competent in.”
“He is surrounded by people who would play football so that he would be available only to the chosen ones.”
"I can be accused of a lot, but certainly not of subjectivity."
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the elected minority,” Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“Although many people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the struggle in the first league.
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Plzen club manager Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pa<0xC4><0x8D>lik has entered the presidential race, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. To his successes he includes saving tens of millions of kroner on unprofitable contracts, negotiating contracts and reviewing contracts.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try on the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn’t have done it during her research trips for the past year and a half: without her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubim waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored ar-nuvo-style swimming pools.
She hastened to add every favorite pool to her notebook – with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder has looked at more than 200 swimming pools – and has now collected impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming), where it all came in, from public pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Tanu.
Her "trip to the most unusual bathhouses in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited bathhouses in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and in one city, Serug.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, says Meder, but it’s different in the water.
The only drawback is that fans of swimming have to put up with the blue tile tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the seductive smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the refined oils in the sauna are a healing factor in the baths so significant, because, according to Meder, all the feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes, if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool you have a surface of water."
“The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and springboards.
The illustrated 190-page edition of Bathing Joy contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases – and causes you to want to jump into the water.
Water reservoir collector Meder found several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She found a nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the form of a bottle (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lf<0xC3><0xBC>rd<0xC3><0xB6> in Jasberen), as well as magnificent baths such as
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, a stunning view opens up. You can see all of Zurich from the swimming pool on the roof or view the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And in the steam room there is a window that allows you to see through.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The Aqua Council in Etztal looks like a UFO, just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rises from it, which seem quite small against the backdrop of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The pool collector Meder did not smell chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of gray. Baths named Arpad in Bekeshchab smell of oil so much that it can be hard for you to believe that you are in a healing source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the eel, which sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, at some point was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Lugachovitsa, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms, designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x87> in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked at the appearances of the windows of the red-white-yellow ar-nuvo-style building, she saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald – the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed through three stages of construction. You will discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of Alhambra, added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace – the favorite swimming pool of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder – and not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so masterfully combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Diving into the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary activity.
Speculation of agricultural products <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Thieves
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann gave the working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg –
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of those polled demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Garald Schumann, demonstrates that betting on the world’s commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
Initially, bets on goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and are profiting from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism. He promised to investigate the allegations and stated that no trade "is worth risking a good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Managing Directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decrease or cease altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical stance on the financial sector. "The stakes on rising food prices are a glaring example of how thoughtless banks are currently acting against the common interest."
As the main lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
“The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money rates on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s about starving people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
Repeal of the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not need to worry about expenses - with consequences will have to deal with his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people took part.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, every second would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to speculation with goods.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing their account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history with ups, downs and a happy ending. The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and was abandoned.
It is now being re-opened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Carl Schwantzer for the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold ones that expressed faith in technical progress.
The Schwantzer Pavilion won the Architecture Grand Prix in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass floating structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, he became famous all over the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister – a cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna’s South Station, converted and opened as a 20th-century Museum in 1962 – and is often referred to as the “House of the 20th Century” for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition is getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolph Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz has so far restored the pavilion, which has been called the “House of the 21st Century” and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in every sense a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Salzburg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted the public.
The new museum was to house a permanent exhibition of Fritz Votrub’s foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Josef Albrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwantzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems that arose during the last reconstruction were much more serious. The building was an "energy absorber", says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a fiberglass reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-strength safety glass.
The steel overhangs of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, the collapsed light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still a graceful Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it was before.
All this under the strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum management,” says Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, problems and transformations.
Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz noticed recently that the pavilion “from Brussels” was rough – a typical story of “the chapels in the city”.
Such an architecture is “always out of place” and yet it wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, because when planning the city there was an unexpected luck. A completely redesigned "main station district" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The house of the 21st century may be complemented by the second building of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz - the collector Francesco von Habsburg has acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next door in Swiss s.
Deutsche Bahn plans multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid train cancellations in the winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Citing Deutsche Bahn’s internal anti-crisis plan, Bild newspaper reports that investments totaling around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million are planned for 2015.
The investments are intended to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow removal from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of cancellations and delays of trains this winter at a meeting with heads of government and industry two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at the time of worsening weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays with the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axles much more frequently for years after one of the ICE trains broke down at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to pay <0xC2><0xA3>1million fine in U.S.
New troubles followed the unrest around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States of many millions of pounds.
Like Deutsche Bank, there were few problems at home, the past of the industrial giant in the United States has now overtaken him. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle the disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem has arisen around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The cost of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are glad that we have solved this problem without the parties having to go to court,” said a representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the prompt response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting to compensate for the losses that come out of billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer launched a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are backed by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a real estate market bubble burst in the United States in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live long in September 2008 on the brink of financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still battling the storm.
Investors and regulators have put forward a large number of claims, demanding to pay compensation or punish fraudsters.
The largest wave of claims is the Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having purchased collateral from U.S. lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing the threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements worth a total of $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt-based bank to take responsibility for "substantial losses" but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unsubstantiated and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, since their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his opinion about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was seen as a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now been awarded the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said that since March, he has acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest stockholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He praised the management, which managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a long time, IBM focused on high-performance IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been around for more than 100 years, offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns stakes in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world’s most expensive companies on its foundation with skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct for making money earned him the nickname “Oracle of Omaha.”
IBM’s share price rose one percent before markets opened after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The “blue giant,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the world’s most expensive high-tech companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of the “cell in Zwickau”, the Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers talks about a “bloody ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought long-forgotten fears to life. There have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the fires in Mellen in November 1992 and in Zollingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the now-discovered right-wing extremist network has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
“The Revival of Bloody Ideology?” was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may find themselves drawn into the right-wing extremist mire.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, recalling the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket outside the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The "Gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet also did not miss the chance to draw this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He notes that people were killed who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany through their work.
The police’s behavior and subsequent successful raids were sharply criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought about following suspicious individuals in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come up with a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsily, migrants will have no choice but to armed self-defense."
"It will be the best self-defense."
“The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network is opened up and on the legality of the punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes in Mellen and Zollingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to peace in Germany.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zollingen is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time mostly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellen.
He sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president after the Zollingen fires, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he has determined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of the current German state has deepened since then by many German Turks.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
The banking scandal on Lake Zurich.
Most of Europe’s leading risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and since then has been continuously struggling with one crisis or another.
Now the German has to return it to the correct course.
Alex Weber probably didn’t know he was going to get that role.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work in an equally spectacular position - Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
“UBS has managed to change for the better.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Gruebel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take over as chairman of the board in May, not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that he had long deserved the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very big - until recently it managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other - for years does not come out of scandals.
It seems that a proud Swiss bank will spare nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and sustainable, but at the same time cunning asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion, thus having more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
and as an investment bank entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute, explains: “I’ve always given my students UBS as a model of a good bank.”
“Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong.”
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley – who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker – unexpectedly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment division of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed managed to find investors — but investors, many of whom bankers would have politely refused to do — one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden so much that even its name has not been disclosed.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel – the second-highest-paid chairman of the board of directors in Switzerland in 2006 – resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred. Due to the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was in danger of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks were established in a small country.
After all, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was five times higher than all Swiss production (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS for the second time,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to pass on data to wealthy customers who may have been taxed with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unwarranted business income plus a fine.
UBS thus more or less acknowledged that it was a tax avoidance tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich customers, the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client’s money flow began.
Over the past few months, the bank has lost confidence in both major areas of its business – investing due to failed speculation and asset management as a result of aiding and abetting tax evasion.
And only everything calmed down and it seemed that UBS managed to turn the situation around, as happened this accident with the scammer-trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment department is not yet working.
“The incident with Adobolli clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk control tool.”
It is caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not excessive risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank - only it is a little bigger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The bank’s head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snowcaps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli you can find such jewelry firms as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Baer.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas. Next to the bank’s emblem is a large “Safe” sign.
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss notions of banking – or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn’t want to see his name in the paper – like all Swiss bankers, he also works with the two biggest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big – in particular, in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, it means they've adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungles of sub-standard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” Lucas Hassig writes in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS size.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which at the time of the merger was too big for a small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a wealthy but graduated bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, CEO of UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always believed that Wolffley and Ospel are a dream team,” says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wulfley is an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instincts, has gone all the way up, starting with an intern at a bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolffly.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. “He decided that his models were a reality,” says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of the board members, at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to push Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "tournament table", which contributed to the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to get to the very top of this table.
He was able to do part of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. According to that parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Striving for growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. subsidized securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgage loans and sold them further – continuing to carry risks on its own.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to get the bank in order turned out to be more difficult than it seemed at first.
The posts at UBS have turned into a children's game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
In front of anyone who will head this huge bank, there is an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger’s banking analyst already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activity needs to be significantly curtailed.
The new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably asked by Axel Weber.
He has only said publicly that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of a recession in Europe drag down the U.S. stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline of industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty — but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12,078, down 0.6 percent.
The barometer of the market during trading ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 closed at 1,251 points, dropping by one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting towards the end of growth.
Eurostat’s statistical service reported that in September the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
This message has thrown American investors into skepticism. “We are not on the island. We depend on them,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to shake up the recession quickly and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC he said that it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do whatever it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw the decades-old principle into the garbage can and invested in America’s high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM, worth more than $10 billion, raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost all of its remaining stake in China’s Construction Bank, earning $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to support its capital quota with net profit from sales in order to comply with stricter regulations.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing won by reducing losses on the Dow-Jones.
The share price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 series aircraft worth a total of $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 aircraft, the total amount is actually $26 billion.
About 710 million shares have been traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
Shares of 630 companies ended up trading with growth, 1913 with a fall, and 82 remained at the same level on Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart Crowds Fill the Cities
Graci are considered problem birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be driven out of cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise, in many settlements is becoming more and more.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from achieved.
At the first symposium dedicated to ravens, in the city of Lehr in East Frisia, experts argued that grace could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for Alternatives in Cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected gracias, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional nesting trees have made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under protection.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Jever, Dipholz, Achime near Bremen and Lehrer there are large colonies with more than 600 parent pairs.
The controversial project to shoot crows in Lera caused unapproved newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and stabbing them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
“Common movement and intimidation don’t do anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lear.
Collapsing water jets or cutting down trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
“Animals are dispersed, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas.”
Intimidation is possible only in the form of an exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We will have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
Apart from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang K<0xC3><0xB6>lner.
A combination of deterring birds from needing protection in residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information booths instead of chainsaws" - was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands give information about the life of highly intelligent graces.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about noise produced by birds. "Noise conveys a lot of information. They need to tell each other a lot."
The minds and senses of these birds have become legends. Players often not only use tools to capture a glimpse of a piece, but also make tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measure of a bird’s mind on four scales.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to tap on the board to obtain a moth larvae.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the board.
In another experiment, the intelligent gracias had to solve a more difficult task.
The researchers placed a small bucket of moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get the prey with the beak.
But researchers gave them a piece of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to hook the bucket by the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four graces have dealt with this already from the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012 <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory at the last minute were long held.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last in the Euro 2012 championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina by a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfecting their fifth Euro after 0:0 in the first round.
The Czechs were enough 1: 0 (0: 0) in the second round of the play-off against the outsider of Montenegro after a clean win in the first round (2: 0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0-0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Po<0xC5><0xA1>tiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloz (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.

Sena Lulic received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal have already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start at Lisbon’s Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo took an early start, putting a free kick into the goal from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range ability, increasing the score to 2-0 from a 25-meter mark.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half-hour, got their first chance thanks to attacking Edin Jako.
The former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the bottom edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the line of the gate.
Yiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Po<0xC5><0xA1>tiga in the penalty area of the Bosnians in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player simulated, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for hand-playing after foal Fabio Quentran - Misimovic implemented it.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champions secured the score with four more goals.
Peter Yiracek dismissed all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Champions are going to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled on the team of coach Michael Bilek and Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadeletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Peter Chech in the 9th minute thanks to an instant reflex prevented the potential goal of Tomash Sivok.
Montenegro’s best chances were when there was a duet between Stefan Yoveti<0xC4><0x87> and Dejan Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> on the field.
Damjanovic struck from the end of the penalty area in the 40th minute and almost scored a goal for the Czech Republic.
After the break, the pole saved the already battered world-class Czech goalkeeper after forward FK Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now almost no doubt that the coach of the team Gus Hiddink will now free his place on the bench of the team that reached the third place in 2002, the Croats are for the fourth time in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long shot in the seventh minute got into the stand, and the attacker Kazim Kazim failed to hit the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and took more and more control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mandzukic from the Wolfsburg team, who conceded a place to Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trappattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro after Germany in 1988.
The team of coach Giovanni Trappatti - who already looked confident in their place after winning 4-0 in the first stage - captured the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to the goal of Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasiliev from the guest team compared the score at the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but it was only in the 23rd minute that Robbie Keane of Los Angeles made his first clean goal.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the defense of goalkeeper Paul Londonak, Ward found himself in the right place and, throwing the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The company, which is part of the Dax listing, said on Thursday that it plans to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s CEOs, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A staff of 2,500 must grow to 4,500.
The leader of the global industrial software market plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this country, experiencing an economic boom, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
The calculation of China’s growth is an important component of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase the turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The business of a software provider with 55,000 employees around the world looks better than ever.
SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by relying on informatization in China.”
Mass Murders: The Human Dimension
Peter Englund’s new book, Beauty and Sorrow: The Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of actors from whom the heart is at rest.
Here’s a tip on how to read further: cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. England’s story unfolds, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at a time when, like one of these men and women, you will get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "a work on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, crafty journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat techniques.
It's not so much a book about what was, he explains, as a "book about what it looked like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and state of mind."
The book “Beauty and Sorrow” brought together the experience of the war years of more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone will fall into captivity, lose an arm or leg, go insane or die.
Their lives flicker here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are beehive owls; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolvable problem is the flies tick.
This is an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless powder.
When the canon is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with the children, will you stay in place or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost no one understands what is going on and why we have to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" traces the fate of people such as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters, and other already published materials.
Stories about their lives can be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund’s collected small moments and fragmentary details.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to cope with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Erzatz, everywhere erzatz".
"A replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about ersatz food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice, boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes made of wood".
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American notices in himself a craving for cruelty and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what the Varangians were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and to claim that this show is not for you and your cynic.
A British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice or be sad about it.
“When a person comes to terms with the thought of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But it’s the opposite, terribly similar to the “convicted man who is being hanged in secret.”
Other comments concern old Europe, which is collapsing, and new kinds of fear.
“The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit who arranges a massacre by sitting at a desk.”
People act in unexpected ways: lowly acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about the soldiers who were trying in every way to catch the Venetian disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea manure, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
“The very desperate ones rubbed it in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness.”
Translated from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible but nebulous, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or such novels as Erich-Marie Remark's "On the Western Front Without Change", rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unpatented pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending that I can remember in non-fiction.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it’s like he reached out to a page with a list of characters from the book, snatched it from your hands and burned it with a match.
After the previous error - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The night watches from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there should have been fewer people in Zukotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the rest of whom were told at first that they were going to the exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence underscored how much the Police Department attached importance to the operations.
There could not be a repeat of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of liquefied gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to free Zukotti Park from protesters began.
The authorities were preparing, watching as the occupations unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis drills were conducted on Randels Island with Zukotti in mind.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills - counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid movement of large numbers of police - in terms of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training".
“The few cops I know who were called to this case were not told they were being sent to Zukotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who rushed inside before the deadline, hearing about these plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including forces from the districts – a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like to work, come and go out of the park during the day, which makes 1 hour of the night a suitable time for an attack.
“It was right to do this when there were fewer people in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with floodlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The floodlights and pre-recorded announcements carried by the speakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units in their blue windmills entered the park, many protesters simply collected their belongings and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to collect things.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered along the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the Police Department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police acted, and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said the cameras on Church Street, along the park's western border, could take a picture.
When the police went west through a pile of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic rugs and plastic bags, full of clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed behind, collecting what had been thrown away.
Some protesters, who refused to leave, were dragged out, photos of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp put their hands together.
And two people pinned themselves to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
To cut the locks, rescue workers were called in.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Brown said about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violating public order and resisting arrest,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the department's wanted police, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operation," Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to enter.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, in the neighborhood north of the park, and Pine Street, in the neighborhood south.
Observers have seen police expand the perimeter even beyond the borders of Zukotti Park from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of police, many with shields, supplanting people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, were releasing air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of school service personnel will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that layoffs were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
The trial is probably the last means available to the union of the 37th district council, which is trying to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator for working with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds, workers' groups to the government.
City officials have categorically rejected the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget they signed up to in June.
One board member pared by telling him that there was no indication anywhere in the budget that school support staff would be laid off.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a claim notice warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing with the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The plaintiffs will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City, and eight temporarily dismissed workers will be listed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the New York Times’ preliminary version of the complaint, the union focused on a series of school layoffs in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assailants because they were not asymptomatic.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island, and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 assistant school workers lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at free 36 High School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find the money to make up for budget failures.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26% this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The union also contends that school principals could have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of coordinators for working with parents.
The notice used the word “excess,” though “excess” is more often spoken of when a teacher from the school’s payroll moves to a list of existing workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents have been fired," the draft of the lawsuit says, "and not just transferred."
The mission is over, the Congress is ready for the agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (Independent, Connecticut), who praises the U.S. for being a valiant.
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic aspirations by both parties.”
The language may seem innocuous, but no further discussion of Libya has taken place easily.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the U.S. military’s role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of the votes of both parties and was never put to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for a U.S. operation in Libya.
This has left the American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — when Congress is irritated enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry as to really knock the ground out of her feet.
Then the events overcame the indecisiveness of Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "is admired by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people and for their cowardice.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council or will lawmakers split up, like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, Republican leader of the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week’s House of Representatives is expected to vote in favor of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the top legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House Speaker Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this convocation.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary session, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been raised in this convening.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and some more on "control of federal spending".
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors — mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they have “made” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the term of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states object to them.
As much as members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are progressing no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th they introduced 66.
This pace is muted compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they have achieved no more success than they do now.
The last amendment that was passed - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced in Congress in 1789.
"It's been used but not defeated," Giffords said in his first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot her in the head at a public event in Tucson, House member Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a federal channel, chanted a tune from the Broadway show, and said, "Shut up."
Appearing on the "20/20" program of the BBC News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate proposals and needed help with walking.
The program showed her a difficult path of recovery after an injury inflicted by a bullet that shattered the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on marginal debt.
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six and injured 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
Asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Very well.”
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a time special "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the release of a new book by the spouses "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The special edition spoke about the recovery of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In the video, filmed by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband’s request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Squeeze your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video, shown by the BBC, shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see a congressman chanting along with doctors “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” by Cindy Loper and “Free Fall” by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she does not remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband said he read Giffords’ article in a newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
The suspected assailant, Gerd Lee Lafner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly treated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
Once during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I’m defeated.”
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you're gonna go through this, you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment, and loss.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines built around it.
The audience in the tuxedos applauded him standing.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also featured then-Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Soldiers are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, military officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they are feeling pity for people in shape.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
“But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like the unfortunate.”
It’s a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about grief occur quietly and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat as part of the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Kahn warned them that non-army people would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they swarmed the rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will think that there is “a cruel, evil veteran hiding under the mask,” said Kanshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to take a senior government post in Washington.
While searching for a job, he said, he felt some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshne recalls how he told his sons: “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect.”
The awkwardness experienced by the military comes in part from American indifference to wars.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was quite usual in World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Bernow, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
Troops are estimated by the number of campaigns they have made, the number of comrades they have lost, or the scale of their losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, at the historic court hearings, it is to be decided whether or not 28 men and women will be brought to trial against the army on charges of non-resistance to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next.
Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, was allegedly raped at night by her co-worker.
That was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a fellow man carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” says Lyman.
The Texas native, however, raised her concerns.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
“I’m sorry I didn’t follow my instincts.”
A few minutes after they entered Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former servicemen will be anxiously awaiting the court’s ruling at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether to go to court on a lawsuit they have brought against his former defense minister, Robert Doe.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by attorney Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 over the next few months — 25 women and three men who all claim they were raped or threatened by co-defendants and that the army did not properly prosecute or prosecute the defendants.
Burke says she targeted the highest ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence? Supreme leadership."
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may take part in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case – putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak – she will open a lot of cases if it is necessary to maintain pressure.
A defense team from the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy — mostly that former or current soldiers can’t claim the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine named in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage refers to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women-soldier teams play an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the combat zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s also time for the military to become modern, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a genocidal atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against an army centered on diagnoses of “personality changes” that are placed on victims of violence to disqualify them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagvati of the human rights group Organization of Action-Women.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Office of Veterans Affairs, accusing him of discriminating against pension applications from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence while on duty.
Nine separate bills proposing a series of measures were introduced in Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported, according to the Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Transport.
But attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases reached the court - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first of a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell details of the rape separately 11 times to the police, doctors and commanders’ fiancee.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker - from a cut on the arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought I was giving birth now - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial over him. It was a trial over me.'"
Lyman was ordered to turn to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with a negative wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs will move forward is a difficult question, says John Terley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing the Feres Doctrine my whole life.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents it imposes.
He adds, “The odds are largely against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy who exposed his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to a mass murder in Norway in July that claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first open court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - just go to Facebook.
“We’ve come to understand that it’s not difficult to access them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism by the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to single out the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy — which marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then pushed ads to them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad asked the user to go through a survey that included questions about their level of education, attitudes to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to poll more than 10,000 participants from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – even without leaving the office.
“This is a completely new way to conduct research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But unexpectedly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who are just hiding behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world – from health issues to social trends, which are expressed in ‘Likes’, posts on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-actual information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site’s title by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it makes it possible to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
“In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you’re addressing them directly.”
Others say that this site could be used to identify and investigate social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their dormitory mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk statuses.
“You can’t solve a problem without identifying it,” said Washington Post co-author Dimitri Christakis, and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn’t otherwise have found.”
Facebook is also constantly extracting different kinds of data about its users.
The site’s data processing team processed statistics on Valentine’s Day and relationship statuses, mid-term turnout in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that only they have access to – cyber-freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for the ability to play Scrabby with a friend thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about what a researcher can look at their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using students’ public pages on Facebook.
“As far as they imagined, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selvin.
That’s why, despite years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still going offline.”
'Cold and Inhuman': Anders Bering Breivik to appear in court for first time
Anders Bering Breivik, the man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in a Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I admit the actions, but I don’t admit the guilt.”
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he “didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views.”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barred him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others - to make sure that he is contained under the castle.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
“I thought it looked cold and inhumane,” one of the survivors in Utoya told Norwegian channel NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but it got a little easier for me personally after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange idea that he was part of a large "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is feeling right now.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” one victim’s relative said.
“It would be much easier if that were the case.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs’s Lost Interview Shown at the Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest discovery in the recently-discovered interview, which they recalled ahead of previews in major markets this week, is how much that creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a diligent organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from “the disease of thinking that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work...[but] a great idea from a great product takes a huge amount of effort.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the advent of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
It’s been about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he’s already been working at his new NeXT computer company waiting for the Internet to take off.
While a small part of Kringley’s interview was used in Nerds, he says the original interviews were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs’s death that a full VHS copy was found in the director’s garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which comes out at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to lay out his technological philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers—thinking for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also times when Job’s perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringle’s questions, forcing him to move faster to more important issues or phenomena.
In the pre-Pixar era, there’s something ominously prophetic about the Lost Interview, when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision for the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about Jobs’ post-mortem evaluations of his work, but there’s something hurtful and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“All the time in business, I’ve been constantly asking, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answers you invariably get, ‘Oh, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
Here's what I found out.
Jobs continues to detail his efforts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Disturbed by the way expenses were recorded, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted by “accuracy,” he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenses down to the smallest.
A joke about the Pope:
Jobs details the “blue box” he mastered with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of empowering is contagious.
He recounts how he and Wozniak tested the box using an automated phone, ordering a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We’ve covered the globe half a dozen times, and you’ve been yelling at the phone machine, and it was penetrating the neighboring phone machine a minute later,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young, and all we learned was that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could master a little thing that could control a big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think without it Apple could ever have come along.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one famous outing that he and Wozniak practically handled by calling the Vatican via a blue box at midnight and asking for a phone call from the Pope, struggling to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two burst out laughing just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and Bill Hullett’s cold name):
At the age of 12, while searching for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hullett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hullett Parkard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I’d seen at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for it.
On Improvised Innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of mounting plates, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on the loan, he had to think about both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember furious arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300] and I was fed up with it and came out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Some of the companies that are losing energy:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would be wrong in their vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who ultimately come to run the companies, and the people making the product are being pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is supplanted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could have been ten times bigger, it could have been Microsoft in the '90s.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a Form of Art:
“A great idea separates a huge amount of skilled work from a great product ... when you spin a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make – some things you won’t be able to make make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head – these concepts – connecting them all together.
Ultimately, it all comes down to taste – it comes down to trying to express yourself in the best way that people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made McIntosh famous was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to become the best specialists in the field of information technology in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they’d be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court is considering the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious issue of whether he would listen to the repeal of President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated a dinner sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted for consideration.
One of the issues on the agenda was a 26-state motion challenging a rapid health overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that united conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a round-the-clock debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be in the very heat by the time the court decision is announced.
A lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the deputy attorney general during George W. Bush’s presidency.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that constantly advocates conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial court meeting.
Attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health care law.
Honorary guests for lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not at all contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia’s and Thomas’ apparent closeness to the two law firms in this case, as well as to the company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
“The judges drank and dined on an official fundraising campaign with lawyers whose cases are now being considered in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly draw attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with case-sponsoring groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
What’s more, the conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue with Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the first instance court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan drop the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing Receives Record 18 Billion Airplane Orders
Emirates has ordered 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and is likely to order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal - more than 1 billion dollars.
This is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the price tag for all 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold rush of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft in the next 20 years worth 450 billion.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft — 50 two-passenger Boeing 777s.
An incredible order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Later on Monday, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The price tag for six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
“The quality of these specific buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for planes, but also the rise in fuel prices that usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest spending items, not so destructive because the country makes money on high oil prices.
This is important, as they are less likely than other airlines to cancel an aircraft order when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent attempts by rival Airbus SAS to seize its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after buyers demanded to increase the payload and range of the flight.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's Sister Apparently Lost in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Election
Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that the drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister did not appear to have applied for governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s seat during the bitter state election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers had helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the post of governor of the Western state is called Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections... They grabbed ballot boxes, put obstacles... and made people vote" for the IRP.
IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing to return, and victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly outperformed Calderon, which topped the ratings before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now owns the governor’s seat, came in third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long dominated.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and several candidates left the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how terrible the election in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n looks, victory will give the driving impulse of the party.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, “I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year.”
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from a European debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries are looking at Europe’s difficulties “irresistibly,” and said Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
“This applies to all of us.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
“So if China and India can help, it has to be done.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing resources have grown threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s unfolding debt crisis has sparked fears that it could once again lead the world economy into recession, and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance fund bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous strength in the negotiations with Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have huge targets and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a possible option, it’s a mandatory requirement, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to provide assistance to Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, some 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at age 50 and going to the holidays to the sea, and it will not be taken well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Neg said the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “reducing risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to come up with “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon’s Terrible Warnings About Potential Reductions in Defense Spending
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has escalated the situation in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the next decade, but now fears that additional $600 billion or more cuts may be inevitable if Congress can’t come to an spending agreement.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to senators to Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester initiate a general reduction of 23% and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a sharp reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will render most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unworkable -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote.
“We will also have to forcibly fire many of our state employees, and since the cut will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the state employees to achieve the goal.”
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to combat readiness."
The cuts will ultimately affect the military, Panetta said.
“Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of contracts and a contract of supervision, which is supported by the troops.”
“The payroll staff will be cut, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of the sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are steadfastly opposed to these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday night, as they released a letter from Panetta.
“It’s not a way out that we can live with, and it’s not a way out that we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the letter from Panetta or the senators’ latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon’s release from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of conducting budget reviews in Congress and the White House and realizing that he was faced with a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a grim picture of what might follow next -- troops with a shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"This is a squad without bullets."
"It's the wing of an airplane without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor preparedness and is unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he gave new details of how the cuts “do not create significant operational risks: they slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; they severely limit our ability to be first in deployment and to respond to risks everywhere in the world.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its proponents say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A cursory look at the latest headlines shows how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Caine is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration has been charged with falsification because they allegedly concealed the fact that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar when he turned on the microphone.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner has made a fool of himself by denying his findings, which has quickly been refuted by undisputed evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial fraud during a campaign related to the cover-up of extramarital affairs.
And again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, insinuated in lies about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud on exams at school and college are commonplace.
There have been cases where teachers have given students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
The mentors who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show, you can lie 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that a significant part of this is lies in salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Identifying a lie or exposing a lie is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, similar to, say, charades, where you need to yell “Found!”, the detection of lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look into their eyes.
They don’t always get stuck, stuttered, reddened, or dizzy.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, mimicry, question structure, and temporal characteristics.
I’ve spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it’s clear that detecting lies is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and that helps guide in our complex world — especially if your professional responsibilities include managing, negotiating, or negotiating.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts are more likely to lie than introverts, that men are more likely to lie about themselves, while women are more likely to lie about others, usually to protect someone else’s feelings, that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lie they tell is most likely outright).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceiver, others will feel less guilty about deceiving you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the “determining of the original state.”
This helps to provide a starting point for evaluating the changes further.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly knocking on his feet in a normal state, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see the knocking on his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for a group of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Cheaters can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, lean toward the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or demonstrate "relief after an interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when everyone is in a difficult situation.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interview signal to simply look at this relief after an interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson has backtracked and used the past tense, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, which led to her searches across the country.
Vaccinated people can also use distance in speech: “I did not have sexual relations with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchy.
Someone can use “qualification language” when answering a difficult question: “Well ... in truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know.”
This makes the answer more emotional than factual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic tool to detect lies, but you can master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not falling victim to skilled crooks in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Construction Plan Needs Revision After U.S. Threat to Delay Its Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- provoking anger from trade unions, but calming environmentalists -- the company that is going to build the oil pipeline says it is willing to rework the project.
TransCanada said on Monday evening it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills area of Nebraska and is confident the project will still receive approval.
The company voiced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week that it would postpone a decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Nebraska Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a huge underground water reservoir.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
A new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to reject the decision until 2013, after next year’s election, although authorities have denied that the decision involved policy.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a State Department appeal and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To accomplish this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by trade unions, who hope for about 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposing the plan are considering a bill to speed up the move from the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current study on environmental impacts showed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but an energy industry source said the Department’s auditor had ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One - whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate, as it was related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBell has been sued for allegedly causing her child to have nausea from fear.
The New York family claims that disco diva Patty LaBell started rioting in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to the point where she was scared.
“Lady Marmalade’s tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she endured “personality change, sleep disorder” and “a strong fear of strangers,” her family says in Manhattan’s Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year, when the working scene of Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Geneva were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying it to Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and lowered her daughter to the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'You know what your daughter's doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell furiously reprimanded a pregnant woman.
“She aggressively said, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter by the door,’” said Rosanna Monk.
I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became furious and began to use swearing -- a word on C and a word on F -- in heightened tones.
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had started a hysteria.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the child’s mother said.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her attendants had to hold her and shove her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so much that it bothered her, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBell do not respond to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the harm done is not reported, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it will receive, for charity to children suffering from cancer.
“The goal is to get Patty LaBelle to be held accountable for her actions,” Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands."
Climate change has slowed down the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labor market increased, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011 - the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for the development of the economy, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however, there was a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only led to the losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the opportunities for the growth of the state economy, causing a decrease in economic activity by a total of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which is reflected in other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by the frost provided by the Council of Mexico on the sustainable development of rural areas, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected in full, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected. The main damaged crops were vegetables, corn and .
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state with 18 per cent of the population, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, and during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with an increase of 4.53 per cent, with an increase of 4.53 per cent.
Decreased liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is discussed by many factors, for economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions that were taken in state policy.
“What we’re seeing right now is an increase in unemployment that is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by a law that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, as people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest in and use,” he said.
Abandoned immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of difficulties with entry, and secondly because, once entering, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay in and require jobs here,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa’s labor market analysis gets worse if you pay attention to the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state’s active population works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and misdemeanors, another reminder of working in the state is low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the state FDI amounted to 630,697 dollars.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investments during the year, which mainly came from companies in the field of services.
Debt (disambiguation)
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July during the state congress the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and by November the benefits on debt were not expected to be shaken in any sector.
Responsibilities
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdes demonstrates a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Processing Industries, said that during 2011 there was a lack of coordination between the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, it takes a lot of work to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be better,” he said.
Deceleration of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as the early freezes this year halted the state’s economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“Low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not become fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of the direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needs to continue the most dynamic production activity.
“Overall, we found that we were working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
“Overall, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done and, I think, the government is aware that there is much more to be done," he said.
He is sentenced to 8 kilos of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine in the amount of income for 100 days - such a sentence was handed down to a citizen of Navolato for storing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the convicted drug trafficker, Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, convicted of a health crime, in this case kept marijuana for distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valen<0xC3><0xA7>uela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the street of Cypriano Valdes, in front of post No. 80 in the city of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white car pickup, in which he carried a black bag in a box in the car, and in the passenger seat - a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court, and the accused continues to be held in the Criminal Justice Support Centre.
You have to make contributions to work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces, and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of remaining incomplete or long-delayed due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although work programmes had so far been developed, they were in danger, as the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes amounted to some 50 million pesos, of which the state had to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided the resources to work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they didn't give us a penny when from the beginning of July they had to give us a part," he said, "so as not to put off, we started work and they have made great progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the term the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
“It happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial capacity to participate, and programs continued to evolve, and this year to access those programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state owes,” he explained.
While the state authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he said the request was made in the name of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest related to them came as soon as possible.
“They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which postpones the so-called “digital TV transition” from 2021 to 2015, as no eight votes needed to cancel it have been cast.
A minority of the four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree detailing the steps to transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims filed by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in the law under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he disagreed with the project’s arguments in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the state administration.
“I also don’t think that if this were to happen, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” he said, recalling that state policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is related to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate to govern the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, leading to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting public needs that have not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic governance, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into a state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the powers of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n analyzed the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data transmitted in the PPRR, the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, amounting to 879 of the total number of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote after vote" is real, with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PRSP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes of the total of 8 out of 79.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Electoral Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lenderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved some reforms shortly before the legal term of their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Goda Rangel did not include it in the publication of the statute, the statute of limitations, the statute of limitations, and the statute of limitations.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJC) ruled on a constitutional claim put forward by the local legislature and called the state’s representative’s vote on constitutional reform “invalid and illegal” because he has no right to “allow or support them.”
In an interview on the possibility of a “voice after voice” Maria de los Angeles Llanderal claimed that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IVM it will be possible to submit a partial or full count of votes to the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes can be made provided that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting and document counting protocol in the ballot box or it is not in the chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes in the election may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winner of the election under consideration and those who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a representative of the party and/or the coalition, which
A total recount of votes will also be made if, at the end of the usual count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in the event that the ballot boxes that were re-taken will be excluded.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRR, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number of 923 protocols.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; a survey and a memorial mass was held on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was to scatter his dust in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the dust of the colonel arrived at the chapel, located on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he underwent a survey of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former classmates in high school and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school studies.
“His desire was to return to Saltillo, and for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam, he always said this to his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot’s sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to attend the College of Aviation in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that his head was spinning even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davilla Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Marta Saag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving a plane.
He is taken to the last path.
Gunshots were fired in honor of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez de Basio, who was trained by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and the state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, and the trojans.
Basio Cortez was killed recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Morea, and six others, all representatives of this ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortez (Creamed), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau of the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, on a training school esplanade where his family, including his daughter, Amanda, and his brother, had already been waiting for him.
Three bodies have been found abandoned on the N.L. Kadereit farm.
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found 1.5 kilometers of the Kadereta highway in the direction of Santiago, at an elevation in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people passing by noticed that in a village house, the wall of which is painted beige and brown, the gate was open.
Having looked inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Almost in one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no shells on the spot.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group of another, also in it and in the gate there are several holes from bullets.
11 people arrested in Kadeira
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereita and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret burials.
According to the published information, initially on November 11 in the colony of Los Alvero was detained eight people, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., when military personnel made a patrol turn in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereita, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the saloon.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped in the public land of La Pravda, which, seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kadereit.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of an economic catastrophe.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of an economic catastrophe and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
“The structure is now well defined,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming the government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought the size of their debt to a critical level.
The administration under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monti must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from Monti to hasten, volatile markets have set Italy’s BTP bond yield at more than 7 percent for 10 years, a level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We have said that we will actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts should lead to a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, the center-right party's secretary, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, matters because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority, consisting of technocrats, that forms Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspending of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his series of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italy’s debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Italy’s bailout of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial backers.
Monty said his government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before a new election is scheduled.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should only be made up of technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
Spanish players have more experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, if you compare 22 players called by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, have a whole list of qualifying games of class A, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named after Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish players playing in the All-Star League and in the strong clubs of the Premier League of England have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
To this, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Fury in the difficult qualification in the Euro or World Championship.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We can see that he leads the list in the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Havi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, a Barcelona player, has 106 appearances.
Casillas and Havi were recognized as the best last week by UEFA along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Shalké bomber Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez with 102.
It is close to a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesque Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side next to Michael Umana, left-back Junior Diaz with 48 games and bomber Brian Ruiz with 45.
Further, only five have crossed the threshold in 30 games: Kailor Navas with 31, Randall Asofa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain with Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 outs on the field are Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn’t even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morales has only four, Hordy Alba has two games, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Adder have not yet made their debut.
Leading player of Spain David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet included the country in a tour in honor of twenty years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the assertion of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles team The X and the local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some commitment to the band; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does it add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We have had some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, these are great places to surf, that’s how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you have made a great show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us and therefore, I think, makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour you celebrate 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and the fact that we’ve been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are very happy with our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
For us, everything is going very well.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the grunge bloom?
It has always been an honor to be part of this great team.
We are good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it’s unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from one city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we’re happy to be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of the Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many bands exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and everything could not have been better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the sake of music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of disappointments because it took so long, and most importantly, we’re still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think of the incredible person that Andy was, and he was, and I’ve always been.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you’re familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that’s why you chose her to open up?
Yes, the producers sent us some video offers, and it was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It’s a question for Edu (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and, I think, he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky ...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of grunge, despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a bit detached from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands I’ve mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and everyone who came along at the same time, and if it’s important now, I think it’s great because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think that when you grow up and you’ve had some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or friend, these events begin to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was re-hospitalized for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a state hospital to be examined for muscle strength loss that is seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which has led to his being operated on four times and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower extremities.
Aginaga said that, in his opinion, Fuhimori should be a candidate for pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor said.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army destruction squad, which acted in secret during the first years of his reign.
Mukhika goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguay’s President Jose Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and start negotiations on the region’s political issues.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the most important point of the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "beneficial for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations," the South American country's leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderon’s support for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s protest and withdrawal for consultations of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, essentially, an agreement with the South American country since January of this year on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave this “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The water pipe will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil paws of the Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to tell us how stereoscopy without glasses will work,” said the head of the press service of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because so far successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
Nintendo said that despite the existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "in the second round" to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between “D aggressive” or one that affects only the depth of action, but on which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and “not succumb to optical illusions”.
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the plumber with the moustache needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the player will discover new moves, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "player" Luigi.
Kolom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo has begun to answer in the United States for a $70 million laundry conspiracy.
Thus ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision is related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive authorities, taking into account that the court of first instance has already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure, he did not “apply his hands” to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo, Sergio Rouano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling Q120 million in the Department of Defense during his presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Department of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
To this, it is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results of the ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Velya in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with a lack of education, a lack of work and problems with drugs or marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions, which in these 25 years cooperated with the association.
The different political views during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor Hordi Puhola, the ceremony was attended by a former consultant of socialist education, Ernest Maragall, and a former lieutenant mayor and current ecosocialist, a member of the municipal council Richard Goma.
Also featured in Fabra I Coats is the current social well-being and family consultant, Josep Lewis Claris and CEO of La Caixa Social Work, Haume Lan<0xC3><0xA1>spa.
He said Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far “is a good base.”
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the instilling of hope in people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work it has done,” he said.
The building where the mass parties were held has been evacuated.
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbors, by a court decision without the intervention of the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
“From this point on, there will be pass control,” the manager said.
The squatters, who captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were settled, appropriated all electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially banks from under alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco was supposed to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were held there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as they said with anger.
The owner of the club said the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it has been nine months since he "forgives" her the rent payment.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, councilor Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week "immediately evacuate the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common sense that have arisen among neighbors and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters invaded all floors and almost every room and that in some of them there were burglaries.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and persistently oppose the deculture that is being created in the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police took to the street of Montral, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were immediately arrested.
A park or a forest?
The architects agree with the possibility of a competition after disputes about contributions
The municipal competition for 16 doors has resumed the debate about the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SCB in 1987, the park again took place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not north-south, but up (up)-down (sea).
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as the bear Yogi.
This was the case until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Kolserol.
By the gate is meant the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is: Colserola? Park or mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are a topic for discussion by all architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people get to know each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the coastline is reached, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when Ildefon Serra’s proposal, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
“We have to admit that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
The Colserola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the title “Colserola gate” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as an entrance to the park, but as a limitation of some areas where we should act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an “intellectual task” with “some dangers.”
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of forecasting public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum site "his swan song".
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
“The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step,” that is, the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools because current [as far as the General Capital Plan (GGP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolserola valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which “do not miss the ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity offered by the city to his profession, to join this project “from the beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is what should lead interdisciplinary teams (“success,” he claims), which should have created: “Architects should only be an instrument.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, since the rules of the competition lack a common type of Colserola: "There were announced 16 intersecting competitions, - he says - in the sense of sea-mountains, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area of the goal".
This makes it necessary, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for a single gate can intersect by program and definition with an architect’s project for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the advice should be to ensure that the strip directly above Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, a legal representative of Red Casino forgave the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the lawsuit against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which is prosecuting the extortion case against the mayor’s brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a posted a series of photos and videos where he was allegedly asked by Manuel Jonas to pay an economic contribution to the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public sentencing, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor’s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Department of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained in that location for 49 days, following the instructions of the second order prohibiting the movement after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderet allegedly for extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent there only a few hours in prison with a medium degree of isolation of prisoners, because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, the evidence of Jonas’ guilt was quite obvious, such as charging 1.5 million pesos from the bookmakers in exchange for the operation’s permission.
On Monday, Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pes<0xC3><0xAD>na to ask for a pardon for the region’s mayor’s brother, so that in the next few hours he could be released.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether he had compensated the damage and which of the partners of the gambling house was pardoning, although the lawyer tried not to give the name.
Based on the record 197/2011, the lawful pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and after that no statements can be made about the process that was planned against him; nor will any damages or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
A court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Perez Hakome talks about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter struck directly on the ground in a state of complete integrity, without attempts to shoot the product.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements, which seem to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the means lost the flue gas."
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 people, accordingly, it met the necessary requirements for the transportation of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of the impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the ship, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements of passenger transportation.
The earth in this place has an inclination of seven to 30 degrees.
By now, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Support Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was operated at cruising speed and that it happened on soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed for the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for an area of lower elevation and greater visibility in the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the strike.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record from the radar of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction of flight.
Dispersion of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The scattered debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the area of the disaster remains undiscovered evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of the latest studies show that there could have been multiple contacts with the ground.
During work on the site were found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a deviation from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful study in a larger area than the delineated area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection Leads Research to Find Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which has been named the protocol “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence”, which will provide a count of signs related to overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Division of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dieticians and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (whether prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m., children will be tested.
He stressed that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Cuautemoc (in the west of the state of Mexico), and since October 8 events are held at the sports center in Nesaualcoyotl (east of the state of Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (southern Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (northern Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with the permission of their parents and under their supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), measurement of blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health care professionals’ concerns about the alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been growth in just 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 percent were obese, in the case of girls, 47 percent; in terms of overweight, there has also been significant growth," the MSSI specialist said.
He said the rationale for searching for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican is 65 percent descended from American Indians, 30 percent descended from Europeans, and five percent descended from Africans, and this condition has affected genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that basically, the result of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can identify whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acanthas) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with all confidentiality, the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main reasons that provoke overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV and using transportation at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high calorie consumption, that is, the increase in the consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Rafael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a blend of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature impacts.
If the signals sent by the road surface were paid attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area in the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, and adds that if the construction and maintenance process can be completed with asphalt.
In his lecture Technological Look at Holes, read within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of them high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscous behavior.
The viscous behavior of the bitumen is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes brittle.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but varies throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
A chemist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which consists of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is the bitumen, composed of small stones lowered into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is immersed in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and exerting effort, it helps the forces to distribute very well over the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, is placed the last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, in fact sand also embedded in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the transport wheels, it must have more resistance than the asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water penetrates into the coating and it is difficult to get out of it, this causes the softening of all layers of the coating and, therefore, the formation of cavities.
In the formation of pits, he said, first wears out the wear layer and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur immediately, this process should be paid attention to at the first signs of current repair programs.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the coating should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to guarantee compliance with this requirement to prevent frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that concerning bitumen, much still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help to fix pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing for the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from receiving the Miss Colombia crown.
Valérie has won the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to wish to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with getting on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1988), Aguirre (1988), Aguirre (1988), Aguirre (1988), Aguirre (1988), Aguirre (1988), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1987), Aguirre (1988), Aguir, Aguir, Aguir, Aguir, Aguirre (1988), Aguir, Aguir, Aguir, Aguir, Aguir, Aguir, Aguir
The question that many are now asking:
What was not enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances showed that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person according to Vogue - the titles, which possessed the Queens, the Queens, the Queens, the
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to answer convincingly the question “What book characterizes you and why?” asked by Martin Murille Gomez of the literary society Let’s Honor.
She answered the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think the book that characterises my childhood, Little Prince, is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that all of us should read; also at the moment I am reading a book by Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with her result: “The universe is wise, what is to happen is happening.”
And you all, please, read at least a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the vocalized hypotheses – Valle burned from favoritism.
The Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> reporter suggested that, since she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, and she was jealous of the other candidates."
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit on Hilton Beach and during two of her performances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy shown by representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN's "As At Home" program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that a candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become a queen."
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided communication with the press, and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why, two days before the election, international juror Lucy Doti said they were looking for a woman committed to their country’s social needs.
“One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we should look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects,” she said.
There is also an assumption that Vallee was mistaken for buttock defects and fibrosis, which was seen on her abdomen, but this is controversial, as the jury especially noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty” taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens consultant Jorge Hernan Orosko notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but the problems of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me were not very noticeable, forced her to lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had undergone surgery.
“Operations are good, but Valéry doesn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was awarded for the first time by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction came true last night, it is said that it was the goat that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for the fact that she had lost the pleasure of receiving the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact is that Melina has a year of rule today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions, indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Kano.
A criminal from Kali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Kano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI Kali, a criminal, went down in history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Kano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminologists, this week it’s time to “wake up” Elizar Gonzalez, a Puerto Rican man who has spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
Early in his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to wander through the jungle for more than five days to reach the places where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the relevant courses he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and hooves.
In the week of the operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something big is approaching.
On Friday night he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens's prints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its external appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a shovel, and a flashlight, Elizare compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the photos.
His eyes were not deceived: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinson that it was the head of the RSGC
Searching for fingerprints
For the specialist in the field of dactyloscopy of the Sijin unit from Kali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizaro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting specialists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
When arrested, many criminals have forged certificates or do not have documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them at the base.
The researcher said that in case of theft he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief leaned his hands to master the safe full of jewels and money.
“It’s hard to work with walls because they’re not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he says.
The fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles from under the liquor around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative could have been suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A specialist in dactyloscopy from CTI explained that in places where there are fingerprints, a chemical or physical reagent is applied.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the registry.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch leaves a mark.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
'Infuriated people' challenge New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters stormed the camp in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court’s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Wall Street Conquest movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to break camp on the square, while another part of the movement responded to the crackdown by seizing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
“Our idea is that since the court doesn’t allow us to break camp on the square, we will break camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to get back to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations,” said one of the representatives of the Wall Street Capture movement.
Bray explained that the response of “angry people” to the evacuation of the tented city, which was ordered personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing protesters to remain.
In addition, the "angry people" began to capture a new park located at the junction of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish church of Troy.
At least an hour they could take the place, but then police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bree could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support to members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending the court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning’s crackdown on protesters.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the square, which led to “some small clashes,” said Brei, who said some police beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street Hijacking movement and enforcing “laws that were issued after the hijacking began, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-accessing the park with shops and other property previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to re-open tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of the protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and a decision was made because the protesters “violated the law.”
Bloomberg said he had given the order to clear the area because it had become "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was abhorrent and shows that deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” a spokesman for the movement said, condemning the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech.”
Those responsible for “The Wall Street Conquest” also indicated that they intend to organize “grandiose actions” on Thursday in cooperation with public organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program Russell Peters Christmas on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant in The Big Repair, a lifeguard in The Malibu Rescuers, Bunny in Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with coroner (ballad performer) Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the December 1 episode of Russell Peters' Christmas as a very special Maria.
CTV today presented footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widely circulated online home pornographic video, where she appears with her then-husband, drummer of the band "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e" Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in her crib.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as lead on the tour "My cruel torpedo of truth" Charlie Sheen, appears in the role of Joseph.
In the tribute to Anderson and Peters, the Canadian singer Bublé participates in a special Christmas show CTV, who in late March married in Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows the reason for the scandals.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "shit" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Revival After the Earthquake.
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the curve of decline that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has triggered a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the country’s rising sun since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the government of Tokyo, the material losses amounted to 300,000 million dollars - a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to pass.
After three consecutive loss quarters, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the financial year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The resurgence may be partly due to the resurgence of purchasing machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% against a 0.9% decline in capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen – or restructure – infrastructure, using loopholes to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly thanks to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% due to an increase in the cost of cars, travel and leisure.
The yen's seal
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugee currencies” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro zone debt crisis and negative forecasts regarding the U.S., a privilege that pushes, like a stone, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to the country, whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government of Eshihiko Noda is not reducing vigilance.
We need to be careful about the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economy Minister Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts fractures in the world economy, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
Then it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average value, which is at the level of 100 points, after it fell by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again gives ground for doubt
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new transitional government of Ellada is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces, begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may not be enough for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support the new measures with his own money.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence of the new executive power.
A package of 24 programs to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear up any doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything.”
The leader of the conservatives has taken one step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must defrost the 8,000 million that are urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the treaty’s requirements.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of Papandreou’s all-or-nothing referendum claims, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties sign a “written agreement with no doubt.”
Amadeo Altafei, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, said the Troika inspectors could “very soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new government “what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although an exact date has not yet been set.
In the Greek truffle there are enough threads for a while.
Sofia: “These are instruments of progress and hope”
The Queen has stressed Spain's "main" position in relation to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second largest donor of cooperation tools, the essence of which, she said, is that it is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on faith in people."
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the belief that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “absolutely less necessary” to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “especially aimed at reducing the number of people living in double-digit numbers.”
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all "responsibility", says Dona Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements that have emerged during the summit, which will last until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new abilities and better opportunities for the poorest people, especially those women who are getting the most benefits".
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face.”
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households would be lifted out of the poverty into which they were plunged.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and around the world “went along the path started years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Mrs. Sofia, as an “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the instrument's father as a "surprising idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was taken up a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I have seen continuous development", Her Majesty said, whose connection to this project brought her the title of "head of the family" yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded the speech, calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said, it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to the times of the economic boom, as this is a “permanent commitment”.
Chimenes concluded that micro-credit implies a “serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty”, and now “more than ever” the governments of developed countries should work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the people "deprived, in front of which all doors are closed", and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, will welcome "all those present in the city, welcome the two who are in attendance."
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but arose in the autumn, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, tabled by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, which merited Angela Merkel’s speeches and a few hours later Wolfgang Schaeuble, Eurofile and Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis - "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe”.
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also affect the European Commission’s presidential election by a general vote “to give Europe a face.”
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK opposes it, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the ground's ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to calm the situation in his party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in dire straits that like to criticize “high-minded” Germany.
Although in the draft resolution on Europe the whole paragraph is devoted to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud with hospital records?
Following the receipts, the UMP and the government launched an attack on the hospital records.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefits distribution fund and give a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose out of a desire to save in a difficult situation, but also a part of the right-wing campaign to re-elect presidents, the majority wants to focus on hospital bills.
First of all, in view of the budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private company employees the fourth day of unpaid leave before the start of payment of the allowance.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick employee will lose wages for four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to savings of 280 million euros.
And that will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose one day on public servants without paying sick pay (public servants have not yet had to wait for payment of the allowance, unlike the three-day wait for private sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority is also re-raising the topic of fraud, referring to the misuse of hospital records.
Control will be tougher and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you illegally received,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Saturday.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement turned out to be somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been under constant control and political attacks that bear fruit.
People in France do not get sick more than anywhere else in Europe.
First, let’s look at the numbers across the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 million, accounting for 5% of total health care costs.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand million euros.
And, therefore, accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenses.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
An average arithmetic that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they didn’t take a single day of hospitalization.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, claims that in 2010 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with the figures of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are no more inclined to take the hospital than workers of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001 the overall rate of absence from work in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital sheets is very low compared to “grey” employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 resulted in systematic hospital inspections lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease findings were “unjustified” or too long, making 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases turned out to be "inappropriate or unfounded", which is 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unfounded” on the several million workers who received hospitalization sheets.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with the figures of "grey" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to 9 to 15 million euros of under-received budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos in parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government was not enough to carry out this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of government, who made his first public statement opening a debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone is "placed on the map," he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts the country's budget deficit to be reduced to "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the New Government
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras voiced his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said at a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the goals of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renu, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 million loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under duress.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid, says committee of experts
Canadians denied death, says Royal Society of Canada report
As for palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow for assisted suicide and euthanasia where that choice is made by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Bureau of Experts, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given birth to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Medically or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dead in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, that is, the implementation of euthanasia or suicide with foreign aid against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during the teleconference that the majority of such cases were in those countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of life.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of older people or people with disabilities are of less value.
As for the people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for the extension or termination of medical care for patients, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legally legitimate termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of end-of-life medical care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it is not used to dull physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Observations by other experts
Some experts on health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia in fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to put the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a 'manifesto for euthanasia'."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, among other things, the report’s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan have called for President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to step down in Syria, where more than 40 civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces have been killed.
“If his country’s interests were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” the Jordanian king, who is close to Syria, told the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East, who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations, will lose power, he said, hinting at Syria, a neighboring country, towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly strict course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expansion of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” that followed the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tougher course towards repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s armed forces have been killed in the Deraa area of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reports.
Two other residents were killed in the shooting and shelling of heavy machine guns in Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this conspiracy against Syria will fail.
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to be extradited to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also called for the United Nations to send observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he said was paranoid.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is going and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the decision of the League of Arab States “incorrect” yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy (country)
Monti takes time from the markets and victims of the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and execute a program that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s reign.
The former European Commissioner yesterday took part in a discussion with political parties ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monti spoke about the importance of a program that involves many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti asks parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare a government and a program,” he said, adding that he was “convinced that markets will be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as president was initially endorsed by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, though he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians.”
The new government will have to act until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti guaranteed that, upon taking office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, demanded, in particular, new austerity measures.
The Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth, can not comply with the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlux conservatism", "professor", symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the forerunners.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012 Italy must make payments on government debt in the amount of 200 million euros.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “from the sixties, in the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosion methods.”
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company producing nanodiamonds in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties brought him into contact with the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “clear signs that Iran’s development” of the nuclear detonator system “has been facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who has also told the agency that he has worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country’s military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence decreased or did not change.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% in attacks on Jews and a total increase of 14% in the number of crimes on religious grounds.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
Since the decline in 2009, there has been concern that the number of these crimes is growing again, Human Rights First said, adding that “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as serious violations of human rights,” said Paul Lejander, one of the organization’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes,” he adds, “assuming it can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality and today sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to its platform presentation, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they watch, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and other "Name" make it easier and direct to track the activity of other "Twitter", Internet users whose messages ("Twitter") you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible to find out if they will publish messages, if they will sign up for new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before it went mainstream across the network on Monday, said Caroline Penner, Twitter's press secretary.
Twitter, which has long been known to be intuitively rather incomprehensible and uses rather vague terms (RT for someone else’s social post, #followfriday for recommending tracking of other users), mostly brings pleasure to experienced users, thus opening itself up to a wider audience, not being closer to Google.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of “tweets” on the Internet.
“It’s useless, intrusive and overly reminiscent of Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter feed, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria (country)
Introduction into the Constitution of the "golden rule" of the budget
The leadership of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget “golden rule” into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by the rating agencies of Austria’s state credit rating (triple Austria).
Chancellor of the Exchequer Werner Feimann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian public debt amounting to 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of the norm of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Greece.
If Austria’s ability to pay fell by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest on three thousand million euros more each year, said the argument of Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria is meeting the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of state and government have demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decree, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, like the municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force the public debt to fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshihiko Noda
Threatening a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Eshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would hold new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Node explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to a historic high, prompting Japanese authorities to intervene on Oct. 31.
On this day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who see it as a “safe haven” in these troubled times of global economic downturn and Europe’s debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that prompted the latest intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar cost about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the amount of income Japanese firms receive from abroad when converting into the national currency.
“Japan is fighting to recover” after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Mr. Noda stressed, who fears that this growth of the yen will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world's third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic indicators.”
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Managing Director Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps,” suggesting that no further easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing body increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 million), raising the ceiling to 55,000 million yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 million) on the amounts it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
Eurozone
rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of being infected by the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10 am CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at the level of 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
Due to new difficulties in the payment of loans to euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Worried investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7% under new market doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its sights on Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsusige Akino, the fund’s manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return to concern about the future of the euro zone is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party congress on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, an opportunity for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a level of high concern.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel participants’ fears.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which is under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 would be the “main task” of his government.
Spain was under fire from the markets ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections.
The spread between interest rates on 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
Expected growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised towards a decrease in the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first euro area-wide assessment is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the danger of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been explored.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now there are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will entail doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing fossil resource deficit in order to continue producing electricity on an ongoing basis, not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance – a theme that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely pursuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit, resuming construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
Although the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the jump in carbon dioxide emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
Consider the example of Denmark.
The European champion in the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; due to which carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
In a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the key to servicing industrial equipment on national territory, and French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay, all the more so because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole host of international trade-specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical engineer will order an EPR designed to run for sixty years if it is planned to shut down its manufacturer?
In order to solve the equation of energy, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
Over the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that allows you to resist such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various parties - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subordinated to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "state of human rights".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news releases when the Minister of the Interior ("Liberasion" of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, stonemasons and waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree on this issue in many ways.
On the right, Jacques Shirac declared in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and on the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from around the world”.
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they will be willing to show to immigrants.
In his program Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limited himself to banalities, saying that "joint work will solve our immigration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summed up the latest immigration data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Publishing House, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among experts on immigration.
Restriction of immigration leads to a weakening of growth and reduces employment.
Fears of immigrants’ influence are based on the notion that they are capable of replacing local workers, especially the low-skilled, causing wage cuts.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than they are replacing the local labor force by doing jobs for which the local labor force is lacking.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the local workforce, and the most skilled - in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
A positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity that exists between local and immigrant means that the arrival of immigrants has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in the migration flow leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates a large share of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labor Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant, arriving at the age of 30, will bring net income (income minus expenses) to the state budget for his life on average 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his mandate was going to "teeth" to cling to the missing growth points.
The mentioned teeth, which were used to scare away immigrants, gave the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the Little, it has been known that this comes from the superficiality of thought.
Universal suffrage, while an obligatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become an “instrument of repression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much else – public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodism of the true and false Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change in policy and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a jump with tied feet into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project must be restored to national sovereignty as a matter of urgency.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the debt burden of everyone, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Getting out of the crisis will require decisions at a pan-European level, and they cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into being is another madness and a new dead end.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is united at an economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine European people’s sovereignty.
To create Europe, let’s create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more widely.
The world’s first chip-card exhibition opens Tuesday in Vilpenté near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), surpassing, according to Eurosmart, 6 million units.
The most important sector is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply carrying out a map of the reading device.
This year, the world will sell 460 million contactless chip cards compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the world market of chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: there are 400,000 contactless Visa cards in circulation.
But large stores are increasing the pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is necessary for banks to supply their customers with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised in the future to systematically distribute to their customers bank cards adapted for contactless use,” said Gerard Nebui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out such transactions.
“They were postponed.
“But they really have to fly out next year.”
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
Banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that it was conducting an experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
The iPhone devices of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with covers that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch a market offering that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
Long-held links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that the Algerians are now certain of this.
“The way these two organizations are used and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have drawn similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger in January found two links.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Lecourt and Vincent Delori, apparently were killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
Here's the terror
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors who were in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerien who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention there to the problems Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
A quick success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri at a mosque, school and under the imam-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left behind 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern homelands.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local office of the United Nations will become their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now of concern to all security experts.
Today, as Aqmi has strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodlak, Jonathan Allen Juppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The World as Republican Presidential Candidates See It
With regard to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplifications and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to presidential candidates from Republicans, voters could believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying the loud but devoid of details of the foreign policy statement, which has traditionally been a strength of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of getting out of the “Old Good Party,” threatened to sue the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency” — a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with an understanding of complex foreign policy, has been unable to overcome a position that feeds emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who sits at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If they choose me, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of the case.
He recently called for countering China’s military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power – obviously not knowing that China has possessed it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
To resort to torture of suspects in terrorism banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to tone down the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of “the boys” from Iraq, and on his ploys in Libya, which have earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive isn't that simple.
The population considers a positive balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind in the sand.
And by claiming that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The Nord Stream pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between the performance of the orchestra and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte together turned the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
According to the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will enter Western Europe every year on the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will become more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at the comparison of the Northern Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already at an end.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” said Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the arrival point of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left over from World War II.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Mueller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without gaps along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not delighted that the Russian state-owned company would permanently settle on its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will cut off the gas flow in less than a minute,” says Jens Mueller.
So, in case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to the designers who designed the seams, designed for leakage only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the condition of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot, which pulls the ship, for external monitoring, as well as by the apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-shaped apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is carried out only by means of its pressure.
It is 200 bar upon departure and 100 bar upon arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens Mueller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay back their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore, planted with coniferous trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the output terminal of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has the aroma of adventures, hours spent writing in candlelight.
Moleskine block is easy to recognize by a rectangular black cover, by rubber, by yellowish-white pages, as if yellowing with time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, has decided to launch design notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The block is inspired by the old production technique, Moleskine - lacquered cotton cloth, which was used, for example, to cover the stools.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has brought into line with today’s taste an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We went far from the production of the first years, when only 3000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer, because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notes in bookstores Fnac, shops in the centers of small cities and was able to acquire widespread fame.
“We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing, despite the advent of e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the exhibition “The Surrounding Path”, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a cover with a leopard print on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Leveraging its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has entered a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for people with disabilities begins today.
Despite a public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities is still twice the average, 19% versus 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for people with disabilities.
“In 15 years, we have made significant progress.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not at two, but three times higher.”
“But there’s still a lot of work ahead.”
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them, 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They are more likely to have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education only 10,000 people with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the essence of the problem,” said Christian Grappen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire people with disabilities.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association commissioned by Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “represented people who were completely in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally deficient.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of workers with disabilities set out in a law passed in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for tax collection from companies that do not comply with the law.
Proof: The number of "taxed" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have employees with disabilities, compared to 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday night (20.45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months later, after the departure of his striker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian.”
“I want to go further,” Lilly’s player assures.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, it is one whole,” he said.
“I’m in Lille all year round, but I’m not in Belgium.”
“I have to earn points.”
Left in reserve, ahead of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "blow".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure".
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them,” he said.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially that on the other side are Mathieu (Debussy), Yohan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“Our roads have crossed.”
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered the "pride".
"Pride" to play in the "holiday game".
“Pride” also claims as a “neighbor” that France “became a very high-level team again” just a year after the injury in Najzna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now, when Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in one plane with the leadership of the Blues... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very self-confident.
Portugal's Paula Bentu starts his return match against Bosnia (22.00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
“By the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paula Bentu already sees herself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt that the national team, which he has been in charge since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played and Bosnia to be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in hell, it’s clear that the game isn’t over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, they failed to achieve the coveted goal that would have reassured them.
“This is a good result, which, however, carries a certain risk.”
But at home, in their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the eyes of the public, who should be delighted, although the match will be very tense," said optimistically-minded but prudent Bentu.
“We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of getting to Euro 2012,” said Karlus Keirosch’s successor.
No one wants to win the match against Bosnia on Friday.
No one could take care of the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bentu said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical merits and players that have a lot of individual merits,” he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, “not to give them time to think.”
It’s a good idea to make it realistic this time.
