Welsh members of parliament are afraid of not being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled by a proposal to change the name from assembly member or AM (Assembly Member) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament's National Assembly.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned about your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means silly and "pwp" mean crap.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group "is not satisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" in terms of name change, but added that the MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bills to introduce the name change, said, "The final decision as to which members of the National Assembly shall be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals which demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the National Assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly have apparently made other proposals, but the struggle to come together has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work. She will submit the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should function as well, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to name when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday over whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for many decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin are ringing as the churches in Harlem, New York, are struggling
"The old I've been talking to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on each corner," Adams said.
"Today none of the parts existed."
He said he understands why the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways now these days," he said.
"Bars are no longer stowaways in the neighborhood that people visit as usual."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the properties won't last as long as the tenants think, "and sooner or later they're back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by cooperative apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white," he said. "And so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it's not likely that these people who move into the condos are going to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white parishes before Harlem became a black borough - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's church a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black souk that had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black parish led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a 1939 fire, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, Johnson's son senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the July bell game called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated story of architects and construction workers, some of them appointed by the leaders of the lay people in the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which leads the parish and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," even though the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's hiring of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during lobster dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took her just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was excited about catching a lobster, before realizing that the boy was shouting "something bit me!
Something bit me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unknown what type of shark it was that attacked the boy.
Bath guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
The Sainsbury's store chain focuses on beauty products
British store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer department store services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and interiors sales decline, Sainsbury's is to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwave ovens, and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
They should give the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup boutique series and make most products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Acting online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops, means that large store chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like department stores, while the store chains are trying to fight against the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has teamed up with the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the food sales and thus defended the acquisition.
The store's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with Boots in the early 2000s, but this came to an end when the parties disagreed on how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special skills to be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit every need, while the attractive environment and practical placements mean we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'raised' after Holly Willoghby pulls out of deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the TV show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "racing" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his lifestyle brand worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and accessory brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, amidst the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "racing" when Golden Holly confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she no longer has time to collaborate on the interior and accessory brand Truly.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was believed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she would not be working with Truly, while Jones fled the UK to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to pull out has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of This Morning host, who is one of the richest stars in the UK, may cost the company millions due to hefty investments in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and may cause delays with the launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment some might experience as "unpresidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his tulle voice as "newsreader".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting following their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the North Korea nuclear weapons program.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received an "equivalent response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continues with sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results—the end of rocket testing, aiding the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach in terms of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were notified that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national emergency, which is necessary for receiving international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
As Redd Barna assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether employees with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Indonesian National Crisis Agency, said authorities are considering the situation in Palu to look into international organisations for the law to offer emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more casualties.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured in terms of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking it up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty area and fauk towards the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and drop the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Prior to the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before splitting off near midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly caught the ball in the middle.
Then he shot it in a pleasant manner and led Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot right past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are scheduled to play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia Tsunami Victims Increase to 832
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which happened on Friday and had a force of 7.5 followed by 6-meter-high waves, the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has started after a woman was found murdered in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 07:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked for tips on the incident from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in an early phase, but I am asking anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also urge everyone, including taxi drivers, who can capture something on dashboard cameras, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the area to question where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told they are not allowed to enter their apartments for many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer say to a man that the whole area is a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says again and again "it's so terrible".
At 14:00, two police cars could be seen inside the police band and another police car outside the band.
A crowd of police officers stood within the police band and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has information, they can send DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference "log 247 from 30 September".
Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes last victim of 'rewriting of history'
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his Puritan followers did during the 17th-century Civil War.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "stupid" and "an attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was poorly ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that divide.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, with cut wrists and covered with blood, near a pig stallion in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the bin there was a large male pig with blood around its mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," the cousin, named Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to the common, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they are curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to southwest U.S.
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa weakens over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry heavy rains to northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had wind speeds of up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa is approaching the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rain of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over much of Arizona.
Dangerous flares can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against desert walks on foot due to the risk of tropical rain.
The rain can turn canyons into flowing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small flares and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy city for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical regions will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million watching Brett Kavanaugh audition
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, with interruptions in the usual television programs of various broadcast companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges within the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional interrogation, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the interrogation on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The figures were not clear from other channels showing the interception, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, there are a similar number of viewers watching an American football final or the Oscars award.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place to 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called for him on his way to a hearing with a judging committee on Friday.
He stood and looked at the ground for several minutes while the Protestants yelled at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on television when the judging committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overheard after talking to his friend, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'like politics' when it comes to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, accuses critics of her plans to leave the EU to "like politics" with the future of Britain without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times is an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, in which he takes on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's taxes is "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for intentional murder, police say in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After questioning with Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson’s bail was set at $350,000, local newspaper The Advocate reports.
The coroner in east-Baton Rouge released an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the state police of Louisiana's special forces, state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "awakened in the achievement of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "smooth" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within anniversary of the vote for independence
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence clashed with police officers, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the vote for possible secession from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder coatings that created dark clouds of dust in streets usually filled with tourists.
Collisions also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants against independence shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries after the protests.
The mood is still pressured in the region and many will still have independence one year after the October 1 vote, which was called illegal by Madrid but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low voter turnout among those opposed to independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the rioting and electoral clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-sufficient were sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said he no longer has hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy in order to be able to vouch for independence, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are too self-sufficient to hold on to power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of police on his phone, said that the conflict had been hushed up by police officers on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing court cases since last year, declared that he will run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Studying as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Man Arrested for Crashing Car Into House On Purpose
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after crashing into a house intentionally several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been used to shoot the car.
Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assures says
Excited Livingston surprises the Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second say after 18 games as coach for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shoe proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side leveled with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side have no away champions in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and will play against the Hearts, whose eight points are behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers are to host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive wins, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against away team
Holt's team should have hired long before they scored, causing more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through but had a low effort towards the goal, which meant Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from midfield.
By then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked wide after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty area, while two penalties – after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands – were blown away.
'phenomenal' from Livingston analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastic and still impresses on the basket upwards.
Their playing and player style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks go to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, were not motivated.
Still as good as they have been under Gerrard, however, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they don't reach up anymore.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies as they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which it is hoped will repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have disagreed on human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters showed up to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also appeared to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about 1.6 miles from today's accident.
London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, the prison office in England says.
Ongoing disorder erupted in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been obtained to calm the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained guards should calm down the ongoing insurgency in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail longer."
It seats more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went into custody.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious rebellion, where prisoners threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (in favor of drought area)
Tropical lows are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is heading toward Arizona early next week, in that the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move southwest across the desert and create fear of embarrassment.
The national weather service has issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can provide rain already late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can rain between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwestern desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For the areas outside of flood risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the dry.
Although embarrassment is a serious concern, this rain is likely to benefit areas in the southwestern United States that are prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme drought is in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will move over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa on Sunday morning is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm strength, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which may increase the risk of embarrassment.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger to Rosa or the remains of her is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American Southwest desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening flares in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police report.
Police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffering" under how "bad and angry" the Democrats were at him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the merciless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered" under how "bad and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in public," he said to a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of voting in the midterm elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are looking to "resist and block."
The first important Senate vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and tsunami rammed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave immediately and so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesia BNPB Crisis Relief Bureau, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he took cars, logs, houses; he rammed everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the emergency agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake could be felt in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Testing and Testing (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found beneath the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the size of the destruction may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut" said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the time period notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately yelling at people down the streets to warn them of the impending wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency relief.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On their way to the city, they passed totally destroyed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As the relief organizations begin work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign relief workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their staff cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a crisis at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open up for international emergency assistance, but they haven't updated the status yet."
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the slow paragliders from the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man called Mandagi said that some of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told that he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu paragliders, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray chin, instead of two blue chins.
"I think it means the messages didn't come out," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from ATM in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker at the Brink's company in what he was about to fill up an ATM in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was due to appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also changed the spelling of the name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico vows not to send military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have caused young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the topic, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government stated on artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranking player of the game Othello, and later worked as a director of Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked for the time the next competition should be, allowing him to join and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think doctoral students in artificial intelligence should be given automatic residence permits," he said.
The State Council of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Association and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (Artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, no one has been working on the national security and artificial intelligence bills for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim on their territory, and has used the veto to vote against Macedonia's membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubt as to how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum seat is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership and agree to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vouch for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make her decide.
For the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds abstention.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 1:00 p.m.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumika in the referendum in Macedonia to change their name and open to joining NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the Parliament of Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will draw investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of your 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "steadfastening of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum – which is below the required number.
Another poll by Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum does not close, it could damage the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defence leading to a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker accepted a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defence players and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He recovered around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still struggling with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about being able to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's court.
Sane held on to the ball while hiring Sterling against the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into goal just before slipping out of the pitch.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play a spoiler against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff contention" there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, hoping to take the "mound" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, leading with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but look forward to locking up the first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such conditions?"
It is still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may have to "pitch".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and should "pitch" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in the 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The President obscurely referred to his first Supreme Court election, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections in the United States.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see that happening right now.
And they are convinced that they are certainly going to take back power, you see how awful they are, how awful they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sinful and bad and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who caused his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who leaked the documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, eh no, I'm expecting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant of those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last in a number of Labour MPs to have been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to the importance of running a responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar issues that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders on.
In the summons for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday's meeting has been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of "kinder" policies is long forgotten, if at all was followed.
It has become more and more apparent that different views are not tolerated in Labour and that every opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I used to agree politically with suddenly expecting me to change my mind and agree on issues I would never agree on – whether it was about national security or the internal market of the EU.
When I speak in public it has nothing to say what I say, I always get buzzed on social media and people want me to resign while they criticize central politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender-discriminatory and racist harassment directed at themselves every day, and who are still professional and don't quit.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In reality, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every no-confidence motion and for every change in the party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I still went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was collapsing, so I wanted better public services for those who need them most – whether as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in doubt as to what I stand for and which of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country crashes into a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the only message I have addressed is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the electorate, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policy and prevent me from serving you in the way I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may have changed the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They now stand on top of the podium as the only invincible team of a total of ten.
It was their superb defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been put to the test in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they were better than us at taking chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to rally, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty right before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the churn coin by five points.
There was a long pause when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and put on stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr fell forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, which Climo "converted."
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty line-up, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays along with partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would be involved in the "successful restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes court will open waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century. They long to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia waits for the verdict of the International Court of Justice to come on October 1, after five years of territory.
"Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the verdict from the International Court of Justice, hoping that the court in The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who struggles to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
“Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the court is going to allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were granted access.
The Netherlands-based UN court does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
That the verdict from the court comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The past four years have far from promoted Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate thought.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set lines at 139 years of disunity and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the promises they made during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked-in nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious about the build-up and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headwear is the latest fashion on the way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear amazed the public during the fashion week in Paris.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at brim that covered the models' heads.
There were also other oversized accessories during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
If you like this hugely dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60-centimeter-wide brake that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag the same size as the bikini-dressed model who wore her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most conspicuous part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such an impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only enhanced by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), work to provide the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standings for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign language got A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those taking German, 69 percent of those taking French, and 63 percent of those taking Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages as electives are seen as equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK selection for additions and features in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills among applicants.
That is why language in school is more and more important to prepare young people for working life.
With more job opportunities for language proficients, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a trait.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Brits in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in what language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a multitude of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the characteristics they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence to Scotland's youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is soon over for fans who are looking to see LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the length of time he will play has not been determined yet.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season play at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote waiting to elect to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build up support for upcoming midterm elections since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are to be given in November.
How long will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was spun over allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmation vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this caving of gatherings is to help Republicans meet the November elections and gain some momentum (driving power).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters that Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman said, refusing to be briefed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for battle to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup thronged.
The swinging pendulum of moments is a completely invented sporting event, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we take it as a small moment , I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and hires by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration were louder as his round continued, searching for an important putt to take match four all-squao.re as he and Thomas had been down two after two.
His putt that won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually only got to dig deep and worry about your own fight," Spieh said.
That's all each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couples are four out of four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine (the last nine holes on an 18 hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cements that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talk of European honour is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swedish dug into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursome are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and are taking a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe take 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a giant Tiger Woods to take their game so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side fined to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misplaced American side in tomorrow's fourballs, taking the series 3–1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they then made a great appearance to beat out an outspoken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sought after 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet get everything they wanted on a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point stand and entered singles, although as holders, Furyk's side only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea Says It's Not Coming to Talk about Rusting Down One-sidedly Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the United States' mistrust will increase, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world government that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get anything equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible for us to unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his abdication proved significant in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Pyongyang has done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "depletion of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "depleting nuclear power first" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they even oppose "the declaration to end peace," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our mistrust only increases."
Ri mentioned nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added, "If the party to this call for nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula debacle would not have stopped as it has now done"
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. mainland, after the evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified decommissioning of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throttle funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the F.N. General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine rush all night long, which means that you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that top university students are often careless when it comes to the very most basic - how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important to how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students received seriously poorer sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The culture of pride over dipping still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in sleep mode and makes them constantly drowsy.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, and which can re-set the internal clock altogether, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal gives Gerrards men down
The Rangers went on to another away defeat when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's undefeated side to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first win on the away field since the 4–1 win at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger lineup with lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an object was apparently thrown from the far side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been thrilled at the way his well-worn outfit took the toll on his opponents at each shift.
The Rangers may have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return pitch.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos definitely knew he should have had a penalty on the 20 metres mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's wish.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly worried about Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep dead ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard let in the break as if he swapped Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the byte caused an immediate effect when the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rallied to block.
But Livingstone continues to outsmart the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow added a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim to punishment when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson oversaw it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE ACCOUNT ... the day when the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was to become the physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific girder ever since, the Geiger counter also became a girder in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it's bubbling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then reinjure
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjure the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "learning" them how they target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West ordered a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after he hosted the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was tapped in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance praising the United States' president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charges of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage due to his headwear.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, Don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken space?" saying that he would "take on the Superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to pranks at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly touched, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication: "The whole studio was silenced."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP AGAINST THE PICTURE."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "quite simply was just who he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I chose NOT to pay someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') whom I think embraces and ejects ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has been given the name Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington faces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's select medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am aware that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is innate and what is being learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make the Game of Thrones precursor or sequel when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the chosen one for Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are framed in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread quickly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people receiving HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have stated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that adding lacquer information from the GOP senator, it explodes into 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedaled by "extreme-right wing" polls and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees - who has had their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these outrageous and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the offender.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparent for anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take Waters' place in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In her resignation, Waters said her office had notified "the proper government and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my co-workers."
Johnny English strikes again - spy toll by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit notables in all new films with a British angle, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deprecating satire about how open-minded we are become the new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber tongue has for the second time renewed his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide-ranging comic maker for moviegoers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the stupid, secret agent who despite his bizarre desire to spread a little glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple melody to the Fire Trucks, theme during the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos afterwards.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor feels quite weakened and strangely redundant, especially since "serious" movie labels like 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's directed at children instead of adults, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica-less nonsense in the person of Bean.
The permanent current assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all agents Britain has in the field, to the dismay of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving on to a submarine driver's job, an over-enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back too fully in the face of Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild play: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's pleasure boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Voltas' house.
All the stops are certainly drawn out to the last sequence, but as lovable and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour Party denies they are preparing a plan for the English to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
According to the report, the party wants corporate executives to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy announcement is expected announced before the turn of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said, 'A four-day workweek is not party politics and it is not being assessed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's working conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was firmly determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "profits" in wealthy businesses.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies can't get back all their efforts as a Labour government could make "debts" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of equity in private sector ventures to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV program "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could cause them to change their minds
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of to what extent the finding of the agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done that?'
He was determined, determined, oblivious."
However, Graham's voice seems to be seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't confirm it.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive lineup of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending the poverty of the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's grand lawn, to not only enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a number of tasks, or "acts" such as volunteering; email a world leader, call a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" – people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, participating in and pushing for a variety of goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, hence at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," — the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that Britain improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the actors performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy as 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports - interior secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow a "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's avid opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. holding has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “run hard” to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "deep look" at running for president after the midterm election.
During a council house meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider carefully running for president."
Warren took on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he is "leading this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been criticized in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violent incident in his home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families marked by PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they're coming back a little changed, they're coming back hardened, they're coming back wondering if respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence in the home against a woman, for disrupting a report of violence in the home and storing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the select gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence in the home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 immigration law decision, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence in the home, to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said friend-of-the-court briefly.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that the policy denying immigrants access harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political meaning," said Sessions in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate any problems—even any serious problems—that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who consoled her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents have been observed returning to their destroyed homes, searching through water-damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while he told him he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowances in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest salsa newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's cherished tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers canceled the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what kind of a newspaper.
Republicans are urging female voters to lead the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analysts.
As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court elect Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with a voice.
These things cannot be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it can get higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed at named Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh has been seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be a little split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more parallels to the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the sex organs while attending a party during the time they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, reminder lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's managing director John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process, and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era online," Berners-Lee added ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divinely celebrated
The only English church divine to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, has been celebrated in its home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick trench and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" the line carried forward before rushing alone with a field rifle and striking out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humble for."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose count contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet, viewers in the UK were once again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the game.
A fan on Twitter described switching to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's public regulation that at 6 o'clock if the inbox wasn't appropriate like this, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work with planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it for five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to hand it over to the fans, and we just went over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "submissive" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that growing up he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gays' rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country ski show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What might look like a loser in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to corpse boys and girls."
He said, "From today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, were the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He would prove he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without distractions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time World Champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about whether I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad did not accept his death and one of the last things he had asked for was if they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I'd been dreaming about all my life - to dive in in front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans don't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape sit Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must turn his form to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk within Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time big winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within reach for the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best to hit with the long shots on the tight, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not accurate with the stroke.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles games, get to a warm start, Mickelson's game can be quite decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't think he played two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Furyk said that his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the warehouse," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having an affair with him too, this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes a lot more than just playing."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last few days' Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the finish line with his nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You kept reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, after he had seen Klassa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's going on on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Glad at how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I would never take the sign on advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that come forth, and that is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there individually, you’re tested to the fullest extent of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself as well."
In contrast to Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turning operations of the great last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he quit as a loser when Europe left the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players on their way into the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw at Brookline, that you saw at Medinah.
When that moment gets to go a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the guys up in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn said of his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but it won't be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and scorching costs, local media reported.
Launching of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home level.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the pioneering warships, which apparently allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when entering service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the whole project – including training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the newest frigates, become especially important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the fleet actually "has almost ended distribution-competent ships".
The officer said that the problem has built up over time, because old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular and soprano pipistrelles and also brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor to NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain forested areas for bats and other associated species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting resting places and loss of habitat/habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly perform examinations, rest area inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within properties, since it is possible that endless destruction of a single habitat could kill up to 400 female bats and juveniles, and perhaps obliterate an entire local population.
Bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are endangered."
Ronaldo rejects election debt in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the violence charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of electing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, says the charges are "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good," the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral injury in an amount that accounts for how serious the rule violation is , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, claiming to have elected her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was concerned about "becoming publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "about" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My perception is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a non-agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, disruptions at the border that the industry says can cause delays and lack of parts may occur.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, thus halting production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid checks at the border."
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily programme.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallais, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, connections between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will resign the general to the prosecutors or not, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a leadership to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full Senate voting.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has been no date set. It could be this week, but I can see for myself that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we get to see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
Host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree that they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president is holding more press conferences than any president has done before," she said—rightly enough without providing evidence for the claim. "We've looked at the numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it that way a lot, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when traveling from the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president might demonstrate why, where he acted in front of reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health secretary writes about Brexit fears of EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although it is less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applications that have status determined for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations regarding withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected end of the autumn.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much I appreciate the contributions of all employees, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays on the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after suffering a head injury when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesseean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State, told the WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details on the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes into her second year of college, and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, with the promise of offering affordable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of commuters.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago at housing number two and rental housing, may be at as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of new buildings in London are bought up by residents outside the UK, making prices higher and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut document fees to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices up by obtaining property but not using it, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "residential shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rent and the termination of deportations for no reason.
He will and will give the council greater power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the ruined housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Still, it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has gotten too far, and the humiliation of being a wanderer is real.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland’
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scot (42) takes on the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Elites last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a B-country match, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hamden with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
That opportunity can only come if I'm successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come up with so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts coaching apparatus.
He then helped Alloa recover from drowning to third level, turning St Mirren, who was on his way down, into the championship series title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"There was another road divide," he says of leading Alloa.
"I genuinely thought that being a manager suited me much better than being a player.
It sounded bizarre, because I did well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you are content to get through each week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body in my entire adult life."
On Sunday 30 September, you can listen to the entire interview on Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13 o'clock.
Survey shows that the perfect time for a half liter is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the intensification of struggling pubs in the UK, but and increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in the children's industry - but for the restaurant industry it fell by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is responsible for the statistics, said: "Continuing sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder framed.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks did significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food received and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drink room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had declined three percent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor industry.
It’s no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle. A 4.8 percent decline in sales annually will be painful to get on top of a looming cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for food operators. The time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited respite."
The total salsa intake across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the release of brands.

One in five children have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, a survey shows
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals an increase in 'fake Insta' profiles
This news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create profiles on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary school revealed a sharp increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the image sharing platform Instagram.
The news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while they and have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to "elect me".
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at different schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are being tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘voice of athletes’ in Scottish athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-administrative director at the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's athletic community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland can benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm keen to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can help contribute and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote, "Today is a month since I got punched.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it was only time that could tell me if I was going to be well again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been completely well again, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising comparing mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what has been described as the world's first silent, sedentary breast pump, technology company Elvie dropped a small-scale advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump provides mothers who mine milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, this isn't buckles, it's my boobs."
The chorus continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "fear" of the dairy industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from those just days after birth," writes one.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "For a reality TV commercial."
Others defended the ad, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "festival."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still breastfed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who are pumping (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement boasting or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no leads or tubes, and its discreet inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, Partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, that it warrants a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers extracting milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and related challenges, while demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognisable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie Pump has created headlines.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of incarcerated immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict policies introduced by the Trump administration making it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and welcoming a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk for that increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be content to submit fingerprints and that this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be a sponsor of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their record before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we are going to continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to employees in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them now have to go to court before a month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will participate via video calls and not by personal attendance, to have their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to selective outbreaks or escape attempts, say the camp staff. Reports that have emerged in recent months say the same.
Advocates say that these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely that signs of child wear are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying hate to friends, can amplify trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as deputy prime minister, said that emerging forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated in from there".
"They must withdraw immediately and without preconceptions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle until all Syrian territory has been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of outsiders."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that war-torn country.
When it came to the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They're making politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say that a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, paving the way for the election.
Moualem lays down conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there are no signs that viewers have gotten bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its best-time broadcast rating to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors at the top of the cable rating with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"This is a fire that people are being lured by, because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer said in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied, according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get to be together again and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bombshell of struts leather to $15,000 ("a garment thick with arrogance," the Post said.
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is he's giving you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about that show that takes place with Trump's employees and daily disputes (enter into a fight with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't be hanging around anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He failed to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before the time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the tightest midterm game
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts in Congress that resulted in two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently revamped suburban district of Pittsburgh promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The map was repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
Competition for the 17th district has initiated an arms race for funding the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Committee, and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button saying in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a narrow advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China, but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partners eject the Trump organization's leadership group.
State secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which receives an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions in terms of visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet with the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration puts on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. services, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the grounds of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the pretext of anonymity.
Student of History
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice is pending, for which there is now significant evidence in the public records.
According to the reports, Mueller reportedly turned his focus in the investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's idea of attacking our election.
If Congress were to switch governors, Trump will have to stand by this body, in preparing to outshine voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There’s a lot of “what ifs,” and I don’t mean to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable—nor for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the match can be.
In 1938, German officers prepared for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had resisted him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed this entailed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unsolicited march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that last year he suggested listening to the president in secret, speculating whether he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterm vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I have my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table asking for the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but overall the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday it will be another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us I am sure that we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now everything feels good.
The stables are good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey from the Nationwide insurance company said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Nationwide Vice President, Holly Snyder.
Here you begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a big part of determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay for the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal fights before they start.
Get a health authorization in place, so that you designate a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the opportunity yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medication is that?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in his way home after a trip to the city.
The victim in his 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politician's stables describe the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 local time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu located closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area stretching over more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming is the backbone of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly framed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of major quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings crashing.
2018: Major tremors hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the violations.
Palin is being held in custody in Mat-Su prison, and is being held on bail for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and pleaded "not guilty" when asked, citing the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and receive $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up at the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in the home, involvement in a reporting of violence in the home and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups for linking her son's elective behavior to PTSD originating from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people lost their lives
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the numbers of fatalities are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment where the quake hits, abound on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Want Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terror
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal offense in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willingly" and that he "willingly" inflicted them serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, the court document says.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in the context of organized crime, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and deliberation", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best known, police said.
Saipov said to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, the indictment states.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty on all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiators
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said police officers had to "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics - with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he should rent the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, mean MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by the Tories wishing to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his plan with the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will push for an agreement with Brussels, despite the setback – forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Farage should be given noble rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had run, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough Member of Parliament, added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their meaning and want to stay is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop Chequers and listen to me.”
In a message directed at May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said police officers must be "felt the heat" if they were to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let them get away with it"."
In a message to the enthusiastic public, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilising the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour downtown meeting.
A handful of activists waved the "Tories Against Brexit" banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is the people telling us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "close look" at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a board member of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of much speculation that she may want to try against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump stepped in.
One participant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time "for women to take the trip to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player, Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11:00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In interrogation, Simpson has admitted to being on the scene, with weapons, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody at the Baton Rouge Police Department.
A third-year student of nearly two meters, growing up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, letting Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position for the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and let Hamilton get into the traffic at the back of the track, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton docked in front after some action side-by-side which forced the Ferrari driver against will had to leave the inside free in danger of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race going for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase speed in the last eight rounds while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job having both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she did not make the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and awful and spoke untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk nonsense," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make it?
Do you remember her answer... did you make the document - "Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't make it."
Wait a moment.
Let's... No, we didn't," he added, while mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it became a toy earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't make her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial did not fall in good faith with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with bad sexual behavior by three women, the president proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see fit.
You see the badness, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead due to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie lined up before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie's equalization in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the break when he scored his second goal of the night on the tampon of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again provided an equalization with a brilliant goal after 27 minutes played.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game. He, in turn, secured the win with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Air traffic controllers lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of airplanes escape earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swung wildly.
He stayed again to make sure that the aircraft on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of fatalities will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis-relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is increasing as we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which is supposed to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military In the country, "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, and 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean reports that a man is missing, having stated earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide any more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wade through the water, which brought them up to life, to the emergency exits on the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew were panicking and screaming, and he sustained a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said nearby sailors, working to repair a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 feet.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes by PNG-registered airlines' aircraft over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts create timeline over night as woman gets burned alive
The prosecution presented all the evidence on Saturday during the appealed trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he assembled footage from cell phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told her that he was using location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When approached, Tellis asked if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense will close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial will go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York City child care worker sues couples for firing after 'racist' text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple to fire her based on discrimination after she received an erroneous text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple have denied that they are racist, and compared the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was unhappy when she saw that the babysitter she had hired, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA ONE BLACK PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman babysitter Maurice fired, saying that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for firing her. She wants $350 a day for six months for the job she was supposed to have, even if it was without a contract, where she was supposed to live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know there's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racists, saying that giving Maurice the sack was the only thing they could do after insulting her, of whom they were afraid she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case proceeds, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud of the inside of how much success he made.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never boasted," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you get proud of them even though it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in all haste, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there soon.
The medications her doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping were slowly coming out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was about to turn off.
I was just sitting there, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't howl or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who had no idea what she had just been through.
"Nobody knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bowed while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt how much sympathy I had for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pinned patches on a bridge in Wales that will inspire and get people thinking of suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the patches.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began struggling with depression and took his own life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up every room."
But before he died, he quit his job, for he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that my little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was starting to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She told that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We are completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking about - a limited investigation - then maybe we could achieve a bit of solitude," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee "falls apart" in the middle of a partisan backstop.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not doing well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who was working in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is ‘going down’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker reports
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, saying there were 1,127 defectors last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not spoken out in public.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, often sending them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which is still technically at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called "hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and sometimes shouted with lumps in his throat as he told about his family and years of going forward.
He criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal police officers who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal appeals court.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must wield the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get the mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was a branch of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold leader that I had always been afraid of – and pulled me out into the hallway.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well run for president herself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she said to me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only run if she was able to collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she would not run for office anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voters instead of the delegates, and anger at gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she branched out.
"You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"Ho branch?".
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were island-breaking, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot his first shot this year at taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has retaliated and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go down with the first.
To make Washington quit, China must do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, U.S. pressure can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make both economies go down is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All arrangements are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would gladly accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they are not going to accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown in that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, struck the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, par 3, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players ever to have received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5–4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most-winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup merit list up through his career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and has only been defeated by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, stated after a disappointing showing from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
You hit me.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a unique captain
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and get on with it.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We became round-the-clock."
