I've been spanked.
I'm the one you want.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's valuables.

I'm working in Boston now.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm afraid Tom's going to get lost.
I'm writing my will.

I only have one minute.
I exercise just to look good when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe a lot to Tom.
I owe it to Tom for this.
I paid the penalty.
I'm planning to skip lunch.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I love dogs more than cats.
I prefer goat's cheese to cow's cheese.
I'd rather have eggs than a pod.
I prefer the black one.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I'm sure I sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched him in the jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I used the word “Alice” to describe it.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I've given up smoking cigarettes.
I gave up.
I grow goods.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the wine.
I really like your web site.
I really love your older sister.

I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice to be quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the typo.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said maybe it'll come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is it all there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I hesitated with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I should go change my clothes.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed him my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I stuck a slag on him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the closet.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich in half.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
I smiled at you.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've lost something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Does that word even exist?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it really a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is yours on the radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow, I still don’t believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how it's done.
I still don’t understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom amused?
Is Tom in Boston?
Are you interested in Tom?
Are you looking for Tom?
Does Tom bother you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talkin' Tom?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I teach art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the demand for a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm watching you bend over.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't have caught you burning and you being the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
Couldn't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't no.
It's not possible!
It's up to you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
That disappoints him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; you do anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm studying English.
I'm fine.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat out.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a pretty good point.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too expensive without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's a conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a chipmunk.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's cold.
I think Tom's out of his mind.
I think Tom's a perceptive one.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not be in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what interests me.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should go out on your own with this.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was going to retire.
I thought maybe Tom knows where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
We decided to visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a goose job.
Didn't you love the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Don't you hate him?
I thought he was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary is upset when Tom leaves the lid off the cup upside down.
It is a multi-stage process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
His first day of school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job in a day.
Today it is less humid than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
- Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't matter.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It’s beginning to dawn on us that we can’t ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage in his essay.
He's writing on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
Soon it will be Christmas.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
I think it's familiar.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink last night, and I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
These two seem to be in a relationship again.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
Looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He's been bugging me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It might have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
Maybe it's weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It may be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have made it up.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was gonna get boring.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I've got it.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally get it.
It probably won't be worth the wait.
He came back two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulty.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't click.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to freak out.
He's getting ready to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medicine prescribed to you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
A little while longer and it'll be over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go a little further.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock already.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you screwed up.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's a pity that the concrete doesn't burn.
It's a short walk.
It's a simple matter.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They disassembled it.
It's all I've got.
He's been back for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Too much time has passed.
This week is extremely hot.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be an optimist and a liar than to be a pessimist and be right.
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's closing time.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you're not dear Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to pee.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That’s what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be wild.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's fine.
It's getting better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take us long.
What matters to me is what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in excellent condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is DE.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's up to me, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like that.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a high priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not how it happened.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing scary.
It's not just guesswork.
It's not an ordinary pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a hat for a thousand dollars.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
That sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's hollow.
Actually, it's very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
Tom might not be able to help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really ugly.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It is strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's fierce.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
You can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
No connection, I guess.
There's wind.
It's work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it toward the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to have been asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
This was Arena Day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was a meeting.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
You were an asset to me spending the night with a smart, witty, and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
This behavior was childish on his part.
It was gross.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was all night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my mistake.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was so grand.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
