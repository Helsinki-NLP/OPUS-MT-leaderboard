China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of the "Taiwan bill"
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called “Taiwan bill,” which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in the internal affairs of China, Ma Xiaoguan noted.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to China’s internal affairs.
“We call on the U.S. side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-U.S. relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no force, stressed Ma Xiaoguan.
TikTok hides nasty videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
According to documents obtained by the publication, the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is using the app to promote China’s foreign policy goals abroad.
Most of the violations related to China's policy fall under the "inflammation of hatred."
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system is subject to a general ban on “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on mentioning incidents on Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists outlawed names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen,” including the presidents of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, and Japan’s presidents, Indra Nakhon.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Posts from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may result in blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: “We are now using a localized approach to moderation, and we are also attracting independent local experts.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says the co-founder of the “Production Center” Rustem Bogdanov.
“Production Center” is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" agrees with the representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov responded positively and said that he had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of Our Didgital agency Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."
But under these rules you can submit any content that the moderators do not like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

The Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the bank’s phone number has increased.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted to the telecom operators information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers, from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services was imposed.
Artem Sychev, deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank, said that a wide range of Russian banks were faced with the replacement of the number.
He explained that the operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the law “On Communications”.
In the Bank "Open", Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the replacement number.
As reported in the press service of Bilaina, some of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would lead to failures in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of scammers numbers, which the operator will contact with each call to verify the number.
He explained that such a framework would require amendments to the legislation.

"Barcelona" blackmails Neymar
The Spanish club Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker's move to the French side Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost came to court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they will refuse to return.
Neymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, took an interesting focus: according to the agreement with "Barsa", which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for delaying the payment.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about Neymar’s claims, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
"Blue-granite" insists that the bonus was assumed to fulfill the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was credited only a quarter of 40 million euros and require the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and "Barsa" almost agreed on the return of the "wild" player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the forward's return remains.
And, as reported by Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial manner, this will exclude the possibility of the Brazilian returning.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

Representatives of the media visited the fourth power unit of the CHP
The video, made in the control room of the fourth power unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, appeared on the Internet, first published on YouTube by the video agency Ruptly.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage can
A resident of the U.S. city of Oakland Park, Florida, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a garbage truck found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a pile of trash near a vacant house.
This was noted by Todd Beavers, who went out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the dumpsters.
Miller saw Beaver's discovery and was upset.
He believed that he could claim a cart, since he was the first to start digging in the garbage.
The men began to argue.
All of a sudden, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same dog and began to chase the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers around his house.
Miller snatched the sword from the knives and began waving it in the direction of the cart abductor.
Bivers told Miller that the incident was being recorded on video.
Noticing the video camera, Miller fled, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Soon after, he saw an unknown woman enter his yard and pick up the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving a car without rights.
The man was arrested and charged with the attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, the hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he stayed, did not let him smoke.
Mass riots on three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protests is further, the more noticeably it disintegrates into separate fragments and loses its political fulfillment.
The evidence of the very fact of the “mass riots” does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to lower this case on brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should excite the public, but it will certainly leave in the extreme irritation of the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later and completely rehabilitated: the SCR withdrew the charges from him.
Minyailo has been under arrest for almost two months, he was joined by several professional communities: historians, priests, writers.
After that, there were only two defendants in the case who were involved in the mass riots (there were 13 initially accused): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been remanded in custody by the court before the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, Art. 18).
The court sentenced the author of a mock petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States
The Court of the Vidzeme suburb of Riga handed down the sentence to the author of a mock petition on Latvia's accession to the United States of America to Denis Bartecki.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of corrective work and one year of probation.
“Common sense is not the strongest side of our system,” Bartetsky said.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia’s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia’s accession to the “Galactic Empire” and the country’s exit from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Before that, in 2016, the author of an online petition about Latvia’s accession to Russia received a six-month prison sentence.
In Khabarovsk made an emergency landing Japanese airliner

Russian Interior Ministry proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law "On the police" in order to protect the guards of the order from spreading defamatory and distorting their honor information on the Internet.

For the first violation of prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for the second violation - administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor for the first time applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Shortly after that, the Chudovsky District Court of the Novgorod region fined the local resident for 30 thousand rubles for placing in the network "two records with information in an indecent form, which insults human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear disrespect to the society, the state, the authorities".

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most well-known is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all legumes (the most popular - soy), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs can not act as a complete replacement for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such supplements cannot be excluded.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues enter the body from the outside.
Veretennikov called for the revival of the Kazakh "Zhenis".

And I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
There will always be a stadium named Moonitpasov, where I scored my 200th ball in my career!
The "genius" must be reborn!
He has a great history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the authorities of the city will return to their native club!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

The Hydrometer Center Named Faithful Folk Notes
In Russia there are many folk customs, by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In the Hydromet center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, though, in the short-term.
According to Roman Wilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometer Center, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will be really hot, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working note is based on the observation of birds.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, it is usually raining.
It is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, then the moss is soaked with wings and feathers are forced to descend to hunt for insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are their folk notes.

Unidentified oil spills have been found on beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Oil stains of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The centers of pollution were scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first detected oil spots began to be received as early as September 2.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as the territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turned out that they are all identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transferred for analysis, said that they do not correspond to the composition of the oil extracted from the fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely, it fell into the ocean,” – told the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the union of workers of the oil industry of the states of Pernambuco and Para<0xC3><0xAD>ba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to dump waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will start cleaning polluted beaches.
Meanwhile, experts of the institute recommend tourists and local residents to bypass the oil stains and notify about all the detected sources of pollution.

A 26-year-old man is currently detained.
Russians have nothing to put off their retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to fully earn the bill on guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite common.
It is a matter of how timely its introduction is.
"In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension security in the future," Matvienko said.
According to the speaker, the Russians can not understand the mechanisms of forming and accruing a pension, because "constant changes in this area have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system, which regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions, social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including volunteering, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension funds.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a draft law on guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of joining citizens to the system of savings, ensuring the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have agreed.
The copyright holder of the illustration Getty Images Image caption The news of the departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many devoted fans
One of the most famous comic book characters – Spider-Man – will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to its use in the films of the franchise.
This was announced in a Sony press release, which states that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of income, due to which "Spider-Man" will leave the Marvel movie universe.
Sony owns the rights to the film.
She rented them for Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from movie theaters, and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point, this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Faye said he was delighted.
Amazingly, Spider-Man’s journey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“We at Marvel Studios are all very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a character.
He is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world,” the statement said.
At the same time, Fayge recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
“It so happened that he was the only superhero who was in different cinematic universes.
So, while Sony continues to develop its own Spydie universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account a snippet from the film "Wolf of Wall Street", in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films on the condition that both companies would pay half the cost of producing the films.
But that didn’t work for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions are yet to be disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: “We have worked well together for the past four years and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We’re glad we can move forward together.”
The film "Avengers: The Finale", which united Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the most box office in the history of world cinema, moving from the first place "Avatar".

In the Congress in the conversation Trump with Zelensky saw the "Russian footprint"
In the lower chamber of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The suggestion that the “Russians” may somehow be behind this story, said Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, reports MSNBC News.

The expert told why it is worth giving up tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that when you brew a tea bag into a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles fall into it.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to the packaged drink, said Nation News food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add there ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
The saplings do not shed at the end of the season, so they may end up in tea.
“Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags,” Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea on a scale, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, due to which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink there will be the least amount of additives," - said the expert.

Regions Offered to Share Secrets of Business Support
On 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrey Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express his position on the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve the legislation in the field of support of minorities.
It is time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions about the programs of business development and legalization of the self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
"To date, communication between regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions visited by senators was marked the lack of information about regional programs of entrepreneurship development in the whole country," - said Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial staff).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be to forward the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," the senator told the Parliamentary newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate support programs for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Support Center for Entrepreneurship, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Krai, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.
In the Orlov region there is a cluster development center.
The Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state co-working centers, at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to emerge from the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes to the current legislation should be made in order to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region has proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “enterprise activity”, as this “is most consistent with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to introduce amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities on finishing and repair of residential premises, cottage buildings, physical training classes.
Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
In the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship are recommended for consolidation in the regulatory and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programs for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will receive development in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programs for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will receive development in the form of specific bills,” said Andrei Kutepov.

According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioning countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion to 975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the fallen volumes of prohibited imports were compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited to import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the period of validity of the rules was extended by another one for a year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decision to abolish the sanction applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has authorized the destruction of “sanctioned” food in any lawful way.
As Western sanctions continue, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, the products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the development of civil society and human rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food "just immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, with the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for consumption, at the beginning of June, Rospotrebnadzor spoke.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was given by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food products is wrong, and it is necessary to think about how you can use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project yet, has officially begun construction of the dome of the building this week, according to ESO.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed one billion euros.
Much of this money will be spent on manufacturing equipment and building an observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as looking for Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome is just beginning, the mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, which totaled about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
