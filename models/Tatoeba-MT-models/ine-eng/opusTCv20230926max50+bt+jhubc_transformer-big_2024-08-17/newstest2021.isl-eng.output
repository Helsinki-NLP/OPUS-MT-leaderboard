Crying out to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has started well and the screams and calls of nature are starting to attract people far and wide around the world.
"You have the message, I need Iceland," a woman in the big world said in comments to an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another audience member said they will keep Iceland in their hearts for all eternity, and a young woman says she must come to Iceland straight away if her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States, so she expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the walking route to Iceland is possible, because there are no airplanes.
I don’t know if he’s from another time zone.
Egil <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB0>arson at the Peel advertising agency, which co-produced the ads with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the receptions have been hopeful.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well but this new campaign is already starting to hit the mark.
Basically, it’s about creating PR value, it’s getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it’s been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, reaching a total of more than two billion people.
The value of this report is estimated at 1.8 billion kroner.
It's not funny."
The main market of all equals is the United States and the campaign has gone very well there even though the Americans are not on their way to the country in a hurry.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also received well, such as Russia, which is pleasantly surprised.
Then there was a reaction from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically put up with.
“These ads have traveled further than we thought,” says Egil, but it’s possible that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, the photographer of Morgunbla<0xC3><0xB0>in, we take on ads that bear the heading “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The trains ran wide and wide, such as on the Sk<0xC3><0xB3>lav<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ust<0xC3><0xAD>g in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, in Reynisfj<0xC3><0xB6>r, at Sk<0xC3><0xB3>garfoss, at S<0xC3><0xB3>lheimaj<0xC3><0xB6>kli and in the cave at Hj<0xC3><0xB6>rleifsh<0xC3><0xB6>f<0xC3><0xB0>.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar P<0xC3><0xA1>ll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and the director of <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
The cast included Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the announcements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in Southern Iceland, there was another group in Western Norway and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for <0xC3><0x8D>slandsstofa,” says Egil, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about."
Explosives: Discuss the state of the labor market, pension funds and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Welfare, will meet in Sprengisand at 10 a.m.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural affairs and transportation to work out of a country that has gone badly and has been disbanded in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, Chairman of VR, will also attend the event, but he will discuss his criticism of pension funds investments and put forward ideas that the labour movement and employers are withdrawing from the fund’s boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
They will then be discussed with <0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, a tour operator in Eastern Norway, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Director of the Nordic Market Authority, about the status of tourism in the rural area.
They will look ahead to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading bid for what is to come.
You can listen to the show below but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth roles of all kinds.
However, she gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her recently, but she was able to look across the street and speak about Clueless on Australian television in the daytime.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met in schools that weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his game in Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station after the night shift.
About fifty cases were brought on board the police in the capital area today and says in the police diary that the cases have been diversified.
The day of the police station at Hverfisgatu began with the fact that police had to deal with a man who had been recently released from prison after staying there due to a computer drive.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man earned a permanent stay at the police station because of his progress.
A man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavog.
Police also had to deal with two men in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt due to reports of a physical attack.
Then a woman who was sitting at a grocery store in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavog was unable to pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A car theft was also reported in the city centre this morning.
The driver of the white Renault pickup truck looked at her for a moment and she was then taken by an involuntary hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Gladiator - The Terrible Fate of the Gleeststars
That theory has reached the Internet to the curse of resting over the series of Joyful, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the daytime and thus became the third protagonist of the episodes to leave life a long way ahead.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes discussed the so-called joy group of young people in high school, their love and destiny.
It wasn’t always easy being in the joy party, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the episodes seemed to overcome every situation that came into their lives.
But beyond the take-off point, great disasters have befallen the players and employees of the episodes, so much so that the theories have awakened that the curse rests on the episodes.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santa Lopez in the episodes, a hit show that didn't call all of her grandmother.
After the show ran its course, Rivera went on to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child with him, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had thrown themselves into a well and Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there himself.
There was a great search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that we had searched for Rivera, who had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially pronounced dead.
She is believed to have landed in heavy currents in the water and used her last demands to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as being drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith starred as Finn Hudson in the series, the American footballer with the voice of an angel who played a key role in bringing the Joy Society to glory and respect.
Outside of the show, however, Moneth sneezed with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had been struggling with addiction and found it difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his co-workers in the show found enough to intervene and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to look better.
Just two months after he completed treatment, Monet was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal mixture of narcotics and alcohol.
It wasn’t about willpower.
Monetith had been treated and his tolerance to narcotics had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His demise weighed heavily on his co-stars, but under his antagonist wife, Lea Michele, he was determined to keep the episodes going and dedicated them all to the memory of Monet and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling starred as Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the episodes, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and bore little respect for his classmates in the Joy Squad, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed dancing and singing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child sexual abuse.
When he was looking for a home, he found a huge amount of child pornography and the matter was soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling had already been.
He was later indicted and charged with his crime.
He was in prison for four to seven years, as well as being required to be on a sex offender list and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had determined the sentence, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the show's assistant director.
He fell asleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
There was also a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not carry his sister's beautiful story, but she blamed Roberts for his great governance and contemptuous behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her fiancée in which she told her mother and sister, among other things, to take responsibility for how she was treated.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was they who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been asked to apply her partner’s harassment and assault at the point of take-off and to have an out-of-the-way constellation.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with computer hacking in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actor Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
It was then in 2010 that an undetected computer worm came to nectar images of her and appeared on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the shows and had a love affair outside the shows.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents growing flowers and get to watch them grow and bloom.
It is also infinitely possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Spending time with your kids in the garden is something you will never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the scent and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
I bought a boat in 10th grade.
“I don’t think there are many sailors who work in the country’s preschools,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who does beach fishing in the summer but teaches psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it is great to be able to drop out of school.
The income also fits me well into the winter," says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who spends summers fishing on the beach like the previous summers.
Axel was the latest to arrive at T<0xC3><0xA4>lknafj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a journalist got to talk about him late at night at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in 10th grade, I took the pilot’s license for boats that are less than 12 meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for $3 million.
“I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a boy have a one-and-a-half million to pay off a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had been putting in and collecting money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all fished out with him and got my share.
I also put my mortgage money in my boat fund.”
Axel is born in <0xC3><0x8D>safj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur, where all his motherland is, but he has lived in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavog since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
I learned in this area west of the rodeo with my dad.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be in the West, I have also been around Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnesid and beyond.
I have also given for the sun, but most of all I have given for the grass," says Axel, who is always one early in the morning and says sometimes talk to the m<0xC3><0xA1>vana and sing for the sky, in the solitude of the hours together in the ballerina.
“The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio and music.
I have no problem being alone on the boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in high seas, but certainly on rare occasions something has been in the weather, but never in great danger," says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never seaworthy.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishermen go each time.
“I am never more than 14 hours at a time on the beach, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I have been constantly for one and a half days in the sea to fish.”
He says his beach fishing experience is such that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he feels hindering.
“Other barriers are that I can’t fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, these four months that beach fishing is over, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their head.
So the regional division could also go because of me and the marine areas that are well located with the fish should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the salt sea on his shores, but also only oats and individual other species flow with it.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at the N<0xC3><0xBA>pi preschool in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur.
“I don’t think there are many sailors who work in the country’s preschools,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the preschool.
“I’m excited about this because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology degree will be used in the preschool stage in the future," says Axel, who also has a long way to go with his studies in business.
An error in the registration prevented home inspection
An error in the registration form that people fill out when it arrives in the country led to the fact that an individual, resident in the country, was not called back for sampling.
The registration number is not required if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be reviewed this week,” says a specialist in the field of soot medicine.
Three domestic patients were diagnosed at the Department of Virology at Landspitalen yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called home inspection regulations came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened on arrival in the country and re-announced in sampling four to five days later.
It was reported in the afternoon news of R<0xC3><0x9A>V that the person had, on the other hand, gone after the old system.
The sampling at the borders was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigf<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of epidemiology, says in an interview with a news agency that this may result in an error in the electronic registration form.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to insert a license plate as is the case in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned did not receive an automatic invitation to enter the sample.
Kamilla says, however, many have followed the rules on home inspection even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases, employers have also been alerted to sending people back for sampling after it arrived in the country.
“This week we will be looking at how to make it easier for people to get their attention on the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in solitary confinement.
They all went to the sampling, but two of them started showing symptoms.
The outbreak is currently in progress with the three infections that were identified yesterday, but it is largely over due to two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, the serial analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the corona virus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the bank has pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be clear tomorrow where the other viruses were coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the website COVID. is.
There are 135 of them.
Four out of five infections unconnected
There have been five cases of domestic violence in the country in the past few days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, to put it mildly, the origin of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not yet been identified.
Smitrakning is still present.
Originally, the third dozen were individually sent into captivity, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are hospitalized due to these new infections, which were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such an event.
J<0xC3><0xB3>hann K. J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsson, Director of Communications at the Department of Public Works, says this slowly, as long as people adhere to standards and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain an individualized infection prevention.
We also need to press for people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
“We can have an event,” said John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping an individual’s infection in the air.
In addition, the rules and standards are under constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the Department of Public Health are constantly urging people to do, is to take into account these individual infectious diseases.
Both at home and in the same way with service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from continuing," says J<0xC3><0xB3>hann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path that we were on, in order to sustain the success that we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
The death was caused by sudden breathing difficulties due to corona virus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is mortally afraid that it will eventually go away.
Reuters reports that Brumfield’s fears are not without reason.
According to a new study by the U.S. government, nearly 40 percent of people who died of diabetes were diagnosed with the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases by half.
A study by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (CDC) looked at more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
It was hidden in the slow growth Reuters had made a survey and pointed out the responses from the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to report any underlying diseases.
“Illness was a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone worse off the corona virus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of a health care professional.
However, the coronal age has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Then, high insulin prices have consumed some to continue attending work and thus stop being exposed to the virus.
According to Reuters, the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the danger that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them were with the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu epidemic, this group was three times more likely to need hospitalization.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to surgical care were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could have been longer, the epidemic has cleared the veil of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the corona virus age may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
As well as direct new studies so that the corona virus can lead to the increase in cases of diabetes.
According to Reuters, scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In this case, a high glucose-lipid ratio in diabetics can cause a real “cell-mediated storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged graft cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all about each other.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, so they left the room.”
The couple <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual invitation from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife and mother-in-law, <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na Magnusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
“I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but I also thought it was incredibly cute.
And I’m still sorry,” he said.
It is also important to remember that the first meeting is held regularly.
“I’ve always heard this story.
Last weekend alone," she said, also attracted to her first-time husband.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I love.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m excited about it.”
Atli says the couple have emphasized in their relationship going their own way.
“We don’t have the same baggage as our passengers.
We avoid the routines that we see around us.”
It is possible that the reason why they took the object from Ragnar Kjartanssyn the artist was just a joyful one, although it would have been rather unusual to say the least.
“Kristin Anna, our mutual friend, contacted us and asked if we could come and have dessert with us, Ragga and Ingibj<0xC3><0xB6>rg, Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps.”
They took the invitation, met the trio on Snaps, and got dessert wine and their own each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plan for an art exhibition that he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had multiple video works called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n says that he has described the work as banal and decadent from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the sentries he was going to shoot and lastly he told us what he wanted to know if we would be interested in participating.”
The sentence that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in meant to show young intersex couples falling in love in a minimalist room.
“It’s a relationship with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know much about Ragnar even though they knew about him and him about them, “but they knew us and we felt comfortable with this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise to people.
Maybe they thought they weren’t going to get the right people, but people who got the sexual urge to perform for others.”
They congratulated Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just into this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atli.
“It’s about love and intimacy.”
He was taken up in a nice apartment on M<0xC3><0xBD>arg<0xC3><0xB6>tinn.
There was a very popular film team there; the taker, Ragnar and the sound engineer and the couple.
After the ignition had been on the recording, all the rooms left to wait outside in a car except Atli and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
“We haven’t decided how we should be.
We were given some instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli, and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n agrees.
“We were invited to a champagne party before they left the room.
It was a bit like staying in a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi’s taker looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s as much about love and intimacy as it is about relationships,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice in his son’s voice at the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to pee in this,” says Atli.
“My mom and dad saw this in Paris.
We had not told anyone this way but so just my dad sends me a message and says: "It's fun to run a small family in the Palais de Tokyo," <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n recalls.
Do you think the relationship between Attila and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n has deepened?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe it was something deep.
This at least deepened my relationship with the connected family," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and laughs.
He saw the work of <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one late in a much bigger work and when you saw this with the other works it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from it and was proud of it.
And there was a little bean in my stomach," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n, who was pregnant with the second child of the couple when the baby was picked up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na and Atla in Love Stories on R<0xC3><0xA1>s 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous Super Bowl
Swansea won 1–0 against Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the team's first game in the relegation round to make it to the English Premier League.
The game was played at Swansea, Wales.
The score in the semi-final was 0-0.
Swansea natives were given a whistle in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew dropped the whistle and gave up.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, was awarded the red card.
Brentford then played the rest of the game one fewer, and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team gap.
Andre Ayew then added the bat by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea 1–0 victory.
Swansea lead 1–0 in the singles, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford.
Five years since the 2009 election
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed lifeguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst took office as U.S. ambassador in April 2009, she has been without a U.S. ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst took office under special circumstances, but Kastlj<0xC3><0xB3>s stated in 2009 that she should have received the F<0xC3><0xA1>lka word.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President’s Office saying that she would not be appreciative of the word.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months remained until Van Voorst’s successor, Van Voorst, took office in September 2010.
In some ways, Robert S. Connan may have been appointed as ambassador, but that is not the case.
At the end of his career, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for decades.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we had another unscheduled period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. House in January 2015 and came to work shortly thereafter, but no ambassador had been on the scene for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but he had served as a lawyer and a supporter of Barack Obama’s electoral fund.
He left office as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
It was two years before the U.S. Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to ask him the questions and confirm his position as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said that he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is deceased, had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter, a political appointee, was a former California dermatologist and has been a prominent figure in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the association, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has been appointing people in key positions and that in recent years the work of the U.S. House of Representatives has been very long-winded, including the confirmation of the ambassador in office.
Since 2009, there have been no ambassadors to Iceland for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented the implementation by the embassy that opened the new headquarters at Engjateig.
The constructions are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the bulkhead safety walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s security situation because he is said to be afraid for his life and has requested to receive an armed lifeguard.
Former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player became a victim of racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player, says he experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he is looking forward to having come to Iceland.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here in Iceland, while he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and D<0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB0>i in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to.
The front of the team was in that position but also he was also with the triple number I wanted to have so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is the racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case and then asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had dropped a racist remark on me after I had slapped him.”
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistakes he sees the most.
Tonny had not managed to make it to the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan but he went to the team with Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to get,” says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams to get to the big leagues in Europe.
Find me in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black worm in the throat of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor was able to pull the snake out with a tongue.
Research has shown that this is a case of slugs.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin cuts of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but parasites such as these are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi ruddi made its way to bed in the West, cases, where parasites have touched people, have multiplied, according to CNN.
Fears that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now on the cusp of concerns over another wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where authorities have taken steps to reinvigorate the spread of the coronavirus age.
In Catalonia, the whole entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to apply for asylum at home from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned when travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also multiplying again in France and Germany, where the authorities are trying to find a balance in lifting the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the number of new infections worldwide is close to 300 thousand per day, which includes the most infections in America and South Asia.
There have been 16 million confirmed infections worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, and there have been 644 thousand confirmed deaths related to the virus.
Moses’ work of creation finally gets to enjoy itself to the full
In front of the Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0> in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large cemetery.
And other smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the street art is apt, and many people are now standing there and appreciating the works of art from millions of mosaic tiles —as if they had never seen them before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it doesn’t look like it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it there were parking lots that were always surrounded.
People laid there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to their feet in the city center.
"Living and diverse public space" and "attractive urban spaces" are the guiding principles for the reconstruction of the existing Safeway Street.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir at Tollhusin to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square and where the area lies well with the sun, it is considered well suited as a resting place for pedestrians.
The artwork will be described and the material will now enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square metre area.
In the area there will also be small "fountains", some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the area with a certain dune.
In this way, the improvements are described by the city of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, which is being implemented together with Veit.
Water supply, heating and electricity will be restored in the future.
Many of them have come of age, but the slalom and the cold water slalom have been around since 1925 and have served residents and businesses in the city centre for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after completion, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a one-way street and as soon as it is created quieter and more accessible space for the walker.
In the news about the Customs House on the customs manager's website says that the house was put into use in 1971, but its architect was G<0xC3><0xAD>sli Halld<0xC3><0xB3>rsson.
Because of the damage to the harbour through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall surfaces were formed on the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such flats would have a bad effect on the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by having permanent works of art installed there.
At this time, a lot of words went by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>i Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and beyond.
The product was to be contacted first before it was decided whether to compete for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect the life at the harbour, since the harbour had been the life of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k since it was built.
When I talked to her, she had to think about that kind of thing.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur was given the time she had to decide for herself, and when she returned home she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, it was requested to make a general agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur had worked with them for a long time on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Contracts were made and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur won the artwork under the installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then saw about the installation at Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0>.
All the work was particularly well done, both by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Oidtmannbr<0xC3><0xA6>r, says in the summary.
It has been a long time since the Icelandic storm.
It took Gerd about two years to complete the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>s work was completed, aged only 47.
Preparing for the transfer of more institutions to the country
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be relocated to the country in the near future.
This was said by the minister in the episode Explosion on the Wave at noon.
Recently it was reported that the fire department of the Housing and Infrastructure Agency will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0><0xC3><0xA1>rkr<0xC3><0xB3>k in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north and the National Firefighting and Sick Transport Association has criticized the cattle transport.
“I think we need to take a step further in that direction.
I’m taking another step in this journey.
“Further transportation,” said Asmundur.
He says he is convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think it is necessary to take further political decisions on the transfer of public works to the land, as I was doing with the Housing and Infrastructure Agency," said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the land and exchanged so much importance for the community.
All the most important things from the second day of the Master's Meeting
94. Iceland’s championship in freestyle sports ended today in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell in Akureyri.
A number of matches were played on the second day of the competition.
There was an exciting competition in the most beautiful women’s event in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell, but Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s J<0xC3><0xB3>nsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from FH put <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the most beautiful event in 2014, which lasted until Elisabet Rut R<0xC3><0xBA>narsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from Ireland improved her rating in May last year.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s won <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti<0xC3><0xB0> back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form up to the last, but she has tripled <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti<0xC3><0xB0> what is summer.
Elisabeth Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and immediately set off a fight.
Her ice rink she set up earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was quite from it.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Kar<0xC3><0xAD>tas Hallgr<0xC3><0xAD>msd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from Ireland had the second best throw of the day, but she added her best performance with a throw of up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH team Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi's most successful, won safely but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw and set the opposition.
His ice cap in the article is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, Olymp<0xC3><0xAD>ufari and <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi in the circuit, won a competition in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvellir yesterday but today he competed in the circuit which is his main event.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters tall, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second-longest today, but he had one valid pitch that was in second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ard<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Iceland’s longest seaman, won the long jump race with superiors, but Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s jumps at a maximum of 6.25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from her <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti.
In the women's 200 metre race, it was Irishman Gu<0xC3><0xB0>bj<0xC3><0xB6>rg J<0xC3><0xB3>na Bjarnad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir who was the runner-up but she reached the finish line in 24.04 seconds and her Icelandic time in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>bj<0xC3><0xB6>rg J<0xC3><0xB3>na was victorious in Akureyri but she won two gold awards yesterday, in a 100m run and in a 4 x 100m run and then also in a 4 x 400m run today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn H<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200-meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver M<0xC3><0xA1>na Samuelsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmanni.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>bj<0xC3><0xB6>rg J<0xC3><0xB3>na, Kolbeinn H<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in yesterday’s 100 metres as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don’t get fined for 27 million kroner Bitcoin crop
The Tax Oversight Committee has rejected a tax investigation director’s claim that he was required to pay fines for misappropriating his financial income generated by the sale of the bitcoin coin.
The Committee finds that the Director of Taxation had not provided a clear explanation as to why it was necessary to prosecute the person.
In the Committee’s opinion, the Director of Taxation considered that the person had reported materially incorrect tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.
He would have miscalculated his financial income resulting from the sale of the bitcoin coin to the tune of $27 million, either intentionally or through a grandiose negligence.
Blame the man for his behavior.
The man rejected this in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, it sold more than 27 million electric coins in the United States.
He would have acquired her with a grave in 2009 and 2010 when such would have been both easy and inexpensive with a conventional world computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coin, the tax implementation due to such a sale had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could have been expected that the general public would have been aware of such measures in tax matters.
He would not have been in a position to pay tax on the crop and would have disclosed his property in a statement deposited in a foreign exchange account.
He would have asked both the experts and the tax authorities about how this would be done but without success.
Then he thought he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules on which the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view.
The man therefore considered it right that his taxes for these two income years would be finalized and the burden applied, but otherwise did not impose a penalty.
Then he retired that he loved in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his responsibilities in an uncompromising manner.
The penalty would be a total penalty and would put him in debt.
He added: “This guy knows what football is all about.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur Andersen Willumsson has been significantly between the teeth of people but also aroused interest due to his progress what is of the season with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Flashes will be on the line tonight when they receive <0xC3><0x8D>A in a live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur then takes out a toy ban due to four reminders during the season and therefore does not come to play with a new clipping as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his collar for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better to try in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to level this game then I thought he would do it or make it," Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson said in the Pepsi Max show, when considered to be Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf.
“I want to be here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to know where he is.
He looks a bit out on the left when it starts to feel the game, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hj<0xC3><0xB6>rvar Hafli<0xC3><0xB0>ason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Pétursson says Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf has a real sense of fun and is happy to have such a colorful person in the department: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There’s an incredible amount of people interested in him, who tell me that this man understands what football is about.
“I am a fun person.
I have to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
The people are reading the interviews with Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf, people are paying themselves in and watching what is next on his hair.
“He’s just a genius,” said Manny.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with some team in the B division"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
F<0xC3><0xB3>tbolti.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the season in his home country, but for this he must first cancel his contract with KR where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic possibility.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B division and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract to KR.”
Then he says that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Fellows in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Biker Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - Now responsible for himself after the discussion DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Le<0xC3><0xB3>sson has had an interest unlike most others.
He survives and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, e-bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "the wheelbarrow" for the weekend.
Yesterday, there was a great deal of controversy when one published a report of his dealings with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on Facebook group Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>inga where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to speak in Austurvell and said that the wasp may have been stolen.
It was not possible to read the original writings of the electrician, but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
Those texts have now been changed on Facebook and the title of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar tells the original news of the matter at all not descriptive of what really went on yesterday in Austurvell.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of the electric missile that it was indeed his electric missile.
The information was allegedly received by the owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, Bjartmar says.
“I looked at the guy and I looked at the shuttle, but with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for it.
I doubtless hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to start the ride, I decided to stop talking to the man.
The owner was sure of his guilt and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter was under the same order as he was told to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yeah, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric scooter went to prove ownership of his electric scooter and started.
Later, the rightful owner of the e-mail said from his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this space year that Bjartmar has spent on this activity, he says he can count the times he has stepped up to the side of people on the other hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are often the least of the brothers and sisters of the community, drug addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are in the street for some reason.
“The thief is a tough master and somehow he needs to finance the next dose, because unfortunately, stealing such loose assets is an easy way to that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is really so good that I have come up with a lot of good people with me on the team.
Examples are that people have gone to treatment and taken care of themselves and then looked for me and helped me with what I am doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is on courteous notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and are peacefully invited to show him receipts, number of bicycles and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has been little discussed in the past.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are, in fact, beginning to point out to people to talk to him from stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is displeased with the previous DV newscast and says he is not some kind of autonomous police force in a personal search for justice.
When asked if he has not yet reached the top of the ice with his activity, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
“Of course the police are doing this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are clearly not doing this.
I've got to figure out the cops driving away from a big pile of stolen bikes.
She's clearly adamant in these matters."
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He claims to have achieved so much success in riding stolen bikes that he sometimes attacks his “students” on the street that they just hit the Bjartmari bikes they had previously hit.
The times that Bjartmar has called for the help of the police have meant that she simply does not attend.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not me teaching and it's not the owners of the bikes teaching," said Bjartmar, who regrets that the victims of bicycle theft have to feel the emptiness of the police in this case.
Bjartmar's success is not shared.
You can find stories of people thanking Bjartmari for getting their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but of course the amounts run in the millions, if not in the millions.
Road there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works day-to-day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a dormitory.
His bicycle rental is therefore an unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Pensions and Long Shadows
2019 was a big birthday in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had been retired by the King of Denmark on all roads from the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established for officials, which eventually became the pension fund of all public servants.
The foundation for the current pension funds of general employees was then laid by comprehensive collective agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with compulsory membership and a valid fund collection from the beginning of the 1970s.
In 1974, laws were introduced on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to improve thereafter.
The pension system of wage earners was not the only radical change brought about by the 20th century labour movement with its nuclear crisis.
Unemployment insurance had been received in a similar way in historic incidents in 1955, and also the associations gradually gained access to their claims for sickness rights and sickness funds, substantial entitlements, shortening of working hours, improvements in housing and social services.
All these rights cost a great and severe struggle, but proved to be a much greater and more lasting reward than the increase of the auras in the wage cycle, which disappeared equally in the heat of the inflation that characterized the post-war period until 1990, as many will remember.
The attraction to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the people eventually agreed that the funds would be in fact the property of funders, the working class movement had to agree that their boards should be appointed representatives of employers and funders alike.
In the years following the foundation of the funds, the requirement for a majority of the working people in the board of the funds was often discussed in the employers' associations, but it never managed to proceed, and therefore we still sit with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority in the board of the funds.
Article 36 of the Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in the first paragraph that ‘the pension fund shall have the interests of its members as a guide.’
In addition, the fifth paragraph states: “A pension fund shall establish a moral standard for investment.”
The shareholders’ policy of the Pension Fund for Merchants includes, inter alia, the following provisions, as a follow-up to the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Sea and in Europe.
The rules deal with how the focus on environmental and social issues, as well as the good governance of companies, can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the society in a broader context go together.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to adopt a good governance framework for social responsibility and the environment.
The Valdi pension fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has a “responsible investment policy” and there are provisions of similar nature.
This is all summed up here as an introduction to Iceland’s latest buzzword, “shadow management”.
Since the word is used in the case, it is not expected that it has been defined for the purpose of protection, but to me the following definition now seems to be "most taken": Shadow management is when the head of a joint venture says in the media that he intends to send a resolution to the representatives of the company in charge of the management of a pension.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not deal with this in the media and does not talk about termination, then, however, it is not "shadow management" because such communication between people is, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about which way he feels “shadowier.”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to formulate this definition when it is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are H<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson a journalist at Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>in and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson a central banker.
The occasion for both occurred after Bogi Nils Bogason, Icelandair’s CEO, had told the company of his intention not to terminate the company’s agreements with air traffic controllers and air traffic controllers (repeatedly), and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, the chairman of the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to them.
Sometime later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r went the same way with his recommendation, which of course was based on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw H<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir as a reason to comment on the matter in the Friday newspaper Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>ir with great words about shadow management, law-breaking and the rich need for changes in the law.
There, little hope was indeed to be heard, though the blessed hope had been in a state of connexion and had also been soon dried out.
Since this is an important issue, let’s consider the subject itself at the end.
I have already discussed the provisions of the Pensions Act relating to this matter.
These include that the fund management should take care of the interests of the fund companies and have ethical criteria in investments, and these items are detailed in the approvals of both Gildis and L<0xC3><0xAD>feyrissj<0xC3><0xB3>dsj<0xC3><0xB3>n traders as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT only look at short-term profit-and-loss coupons in their investments.
Such would be precisely a dangerous policy and one need not look for long at examples of such in the past, where large lending banks and funds have run into immoral adventures and environmentalism, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair’s CEO was obviously on the ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Best of all, he saw it and pulled it back.
The time will determine whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund companies when standing up.
He is a former professor of physics and history of science.
One of the infected did not have a home invasion
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic state on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, however, does not live here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions to apply for so-called home inspection after arriving in Iceland and going to another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got a negative from the border inspection.
“But he is in Icelandic society and really should go into that resource,” says Kamilla J<0xC3><0xB3>sepsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of soot medicine at Landl<0xC3><0xA6>kni and a substitute sottvarn<0xC3><0xAD>knik while on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you are not automatically entered in the second sample.”
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he is actually living abroad but because of his connection to the country that Icelander should have used it instead of Icelandic.
But he didn’t realize it.
“When the license plate is not registered, you have to apply for it yourself to come in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right path," says Kamilla.
“So it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic messaging system even though Icelanders do not register their ID.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person concerned did manage to get to the country even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, remaining Icelander.
Only six have been sent to asylum after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in communication with him.
They are about to be sampled, but two of them are starting to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla probably says that he had recently been infected by the virus that she had not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not entirely possible to argue that this is certainly an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sporting events.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how many people are there.
"It's really very unlikely," says Kamilla, but notes that it can't be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has been done to sort out the virus in the man.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he brought it to the country.”
Piperspreyi and explosives used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police fired pepper sprays and indiscriminate handguns at protesters, but protesters broke windows and set fire to them.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were widely protested in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the suspect has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protest.
A group of people then set fire to a building site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Police later said the protest was unsettled and clashes broke out between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police last August, was the least of the protesters.
A car drove through a crowd of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in the camps to closed street rallies where police related the group from a group of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white barista in May.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of the English national team.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r and his men end up in 5th place and lose the Champions League seat.
However, they should still hope to make it to the Champions League by winning the European Championship next month.
“We’re not at the station.
If we get a point against Leicester I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period now," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to reach the two teams above us," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It is clear that nerves of people will be then at 15 today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend that every other game was about.
“If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is built on.
We have created a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it is our turn to take advantage of it," said Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period."
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last period,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western sea since the beginning of the epidemic there in the country.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days there have been more than 1,000 deaths from the virus every day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the U.S. government’s forecast, the death toll from the virus will be 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of the Second Wave
Authorities in Spain are now struggling to contain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
Since the beginning of May, no more have been detected in one day, and the rumors come at the same time as the Spaniards begin to relax one of the strictest exits in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now obliged passengers coming from Spain to take shelter at home.
A week ago, Spain was on the UK’s list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north-eastern part of Spain, where the authorities have resorted to more extensive restrictions to try to tune the level of growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks, and fireworks will be closed at midnight.
The ban is now in effect for 200,000 residents of Segria County in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the United Kingdom will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the pandemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to a massive exit ban that has largely put the economy in disrepair.
Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken such a stand against nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, France’s prime minister, said the country “would not be able to survive, economically or socially,” if it were to be re-imposed an exit ban nationwide.
Hopefully, many stewards of this local resource that reaches residents of individual towns, cities or areas will be enough to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three inland
Three of them were found at the border yesterday, as well as two more at the border.
So, five people with positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In a statement, the media said that one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and the sixteen who were in close communion with him in exile.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k and, according to the announcement, is “only part of the sport” in the hospital.
Others who were sent to the orphanage are related to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and the infection is in full swing with the infection control team of the state police.
The opponents of the ReyCUP have complied with the instructions and rules of the paramedics and the general public that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, yesterday, photos of the event attracted attention, as they had to see in a very close conversation to celebrate the good exchange of their team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, protesters posted the following message on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that contestants apply for their own dowry at school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but related to the infection reported last year.
In the announcement, it said: “Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infections and revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
The infection is also treated in this case and the person is infected in isolation and 12 in isolation due to the infection.
The third infection is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
It is located in the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in exile.
Two of them are already starting to show symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two were identified at the border and further research is expected, such as a course of work on border infections.
Finally, the announcement says: The Department of Public Health and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to be careful and take good care of individual infectious diseases.
Playing the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is the same person asked to go for sampling at the next health facility.
Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur says the campsite booked for a shopkeeper's weekend - Direct guests to another
The campground at Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked over the weekend, according to Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0>ir’s announcement.
Check out our other properties, including B&B's and B&B's.
The Western-built Bildudal, T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes <0xC3><0xA1> Rau<0xC3><0xB0>asandi, H<0xC3><0xB3>tel Fl<0xC3><0xB3>kalund and H<0xC3><0xB3>tel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>av<0xC3><0xAD>k are other options in the location.
It is enough to be on Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because like last year Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore has become a strong tradition in the city.
From an application in the camp area to judge you can expect a good reception this year, if the weather does not put a strain on the account, but DV said earlier today from a derivative forecast.
However, one can expect the worst weather in the sun, and hope for Patreksfjordur.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other lodgings in the town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment building caved down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live for free in Dunhaga 18–20.
While the owners apply for a building permit for renovation, their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, there is a modest apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are the doors of two staircases, each of which houses four rather modest apartments.
They are in the range of 93-130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a lot of history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted, among other things, video rental, the School, the dairy dairy shop, the J<0xC3><0xB3>a gun shop, a fish shop and now the last University Apprentice.
The house, so slow to speak, has reminded its fool more beautiful.
The house is now under a lot of damage, as can be seen in the attached pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sson and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s joined Borgunar’s ownership group and was a defender of Borgunar’s holding company.
Among the owners of Borgunar is St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf. is an investment company of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>nar Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and her children.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n is also the owner of a third party in D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n and her husband, <0xC3><0x81>g<0xC3><0xBA>st Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once rowed the steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little that has been kept since then.
Tell your neighbors that the condition of the house has steadily worsened since then, though most in recent years.
According to a Facebook page of residents in the district, one resident said the house “has not been particularly vibrant in recent years.”
There, it may play into the fact that the owners have for a few years been struggling to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been okay for a long time.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve done anything with this stain and it’s sad that it’s gone like this.”
He also says that he is mad at the owners of the house for not having dared to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this “legal loophole”.
“Just do it in consultation with the community around you so that you can drive through this and finish it.”
The "legislative step" referred to by the resident is the planning process of the field that has been in progress at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then came by permission to build a floor above the current apartment building and behind the house, a new lift house and a one-storey extension as well as basements.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee rejected it because the implementation was not based on a divisional structure and branch notification was not sufficient.
Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k city then started with the divisional work and finished it with an advertisement in the newspaper St<0xC3><0xB8>rnart<0xC3><0xAD>ndir in July last year.
That arrangement was also appealed and the committee scrapped it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the start.
The house had suffered greatly during this time and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbor of the house out to the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not.
Others were angry with the city, others were not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily out to anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was sluggish, but neighbors have used the unused parking lot Dunhaga 18–20 under their vehicle.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said he was tired of the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process in three steps is absolutely incredible.
It’s like the city of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k can’t read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and is neglected.
A monument to the city’s administrative phases and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of their work that are now in the process of being started.
When the journalist was driving to the garden at Dunhaga 18, we blew him a gallop of doors and trash cans.
A Playstation computer and a new TV were lying in the middle of another mess on earth —the victims of Iceland’s summer blues.
It was opened in the old office of the University Apprentice and there was a lot of cats of the smell to judge.
It is clear that someone has wandered around in one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of couches and beds and a few folds of geography pages, which were probably to become a book, were blown away.
The steps of the apartment were also open and life in them both.
A journalist was so lucky to run against the inhabitants of one of them.
It was there that the Romans had a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and mimic DV’s permission that the company has paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not advisable to collect rent.
From the stands of mail in the front door of the house to judge it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers in the last losses.
The operation of employee rentals has not gone unnoticed by the Covid-19 situation, since a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction industry and these two industries have been the most efficient to use the services of employee rentals.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung the workers and the tenants in the community to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist praised the Romanian boys, it suddenly became clear to him that the best place in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k is 1,500 square meters of real estate.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the condition but share the definition of "improvement".
In between, the city’s planning area sits on the starting line, the victim of endless appeals and appeals opportunities in the planning process, and the crucial resolution of the Committee on Environmental and Resource Affairs.
The house is home to such Romanian workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on July 17.
In the fight against obesity in the wake of the corona virus era
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on junk food ads, following his serious illness, in part because of his weight.
Johnson will present the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their paratroopers in excess of weight and will also be attacked in an effort to increase the number of cycling trails.
TV spot advertisements will then be banned before 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods,” a spokesman for the government said.
Johnson himself has been involved in weight problems, but he was put into surgery when he became infected with the coronavirus this spring, and that is in part to his weight because he is thought to have been so seriously weakened.
Women are better at bringing about change.
She said that the new constitution would be the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater division of power, transparency and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little bit now, and who is better off making such changes than the group of society that should be easier to be in these values.
There are women,” said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s association.
To stand together and be together in bringing about change.
So now it’s just up to us to make these changes.”
She said she was a bit concerned about the focus on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginal groups.
We don’t all live by the same rules here,” Helga said.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good terms in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelandic people are building at a very masculine value.
She said that politics was about forming self-interests, dominations, and powers that were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
“Women are now starting this group and coming together and are just getting a little annoyed that the Althingi is going to move in and look past this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“It’s these women’s values that we’re thinking about.
From the point of view of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all really on the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values in the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change things differently," Helga said.
“It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always paid lower.
“It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to be constantly in a nuclear war just to get decent pay.”

Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he intimidated pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>, where two were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped the motorcyclist in Hl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>in where the driver was at 146 km speed with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
Then there was a lot of noise announcements due to compliance.
On Saturday night, there were reports of eleven loud conspiracies, much of which were recorded in the police diary.
On the night of the incident, 22 noises were heard on board the police.
Six were held in a prison cell last night.
Police were called to the scene last night when they were shooting rockets into the air.
However, they had already avoided it when police officers were in the yard.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for the theft and/or drug use.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, and one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were transferred to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the western city.
One was taken to an accident department after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavog.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who drove a caravan on Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police’s diary, the bicycle equipment of the caravan was in “very bad condition” and it was stationary.
You can stay in the house of Monet for the weekend
The house, which the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in, is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are around the shopkeeper's weekend.
The house is small and beautiful, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you plan to rent the house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb page, it’s almost free after a week, on the Sunday of the shopkeeper’s weekend, and so it might be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to rush into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over the weekend will cost only 964 U.S. dollars, or just over 130 thousand Icelandic crowns, according to the next edition of the newspaper.
Dozens of patients and some of them begin to show signs of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been identified with the domestic coronavirus in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been admitted because of this and some of them are beginning to show signs of the disease caused by viruses.
Three were identified with the domestic corona virus yesterday and two at border inspection.
An expert in the office of a GP says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
“There’s been a series of reports from the previous national championship and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think that it’s been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that is new to the country, but of course we need to be very well on guard now," said Kamilla Sigr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>ur J<0xC3><0xB3>sefsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of emergency services of the GP's office.
Most of the infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More samples will be taken in the near future, but some that were in association with those infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no flu and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite free-spirited by doing these tests on people who would have found a reason to do something else at the time of the flu,” Kamilla said.
The registration process is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people need to go to the asylum.
Two of the infected were identified after attending a sports event.
It has raised questions about whether it is safe to hold such an event.
The director of public relations says it well as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for those infected to have been infected at the sporting events.
“If more people don’t go into isolation from these individuals after going around them at these sports events, then we can maintain that our efforts at the events have worked.
But it has not come to light," said Kamilla.
The Department of Homeland Security is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if there seems to be an occasion,” Kamilla said.
After a week, the number limits will be extended to a thousand people.
This new situation could have an impact on the situation.
“A certain meditation to cook” - See the menu of El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ars
El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir is a professional footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for her day’s work and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
A normal day at my place of work starts at eight,” says El<0xC3><0xAD>sa.
“After work, I go to the shop to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the preschool at three o’clock.”
Elisa finds it very rewarding to bring her daughter to the preschool early.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second half.
After the exercise, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our mind."
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her Master’s Degree in Nutrition and therefore knows well what is suitable for her to eat to have enough energy to do her work, school, family and exercises.
“What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well-composed of protein, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to categorize food into bad or good, rather nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
“I think it’s a good idea to cook in the kitchen and get a lot out of it.
I have to say that my self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, put in almond milk overnight.
Make this meal the way it is every day.
Most often it is banana and sprouted mussels & kaffi.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Dimensions: Incredibly uneven, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shell with banana and muesli, bread with fillings and so I could eat hummus with spoons up out of the box if so appropriate.

Conflicts between police and protesters in Seattle
The Seattle, Washington, D.C., city authorities have declared a state of insurrection following a mass protest in the city center.
Police yesterday seized explosives and pepper spray to try to demolish a large area that protesters had subdued and stretched across many buildings in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
Police said on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation had been carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly by some kind of bomb.
City and police officials said protesters had pelted police with rocks, bottles, bullets and other loose materials, and one policeman had been taken to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blow to them was to show protestors in Portland, Oregon, a city that has repeatedly seen fierce clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal police.
There, as in other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding redress.
Not withdrawn until after a vote has been taken
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of Icelandair’s air carriers, which are due to take effect at the next meeting of the month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic Airfreight Association’s collective agreement on behalf of Icelandair’s airfreight partners will be concluded by noon tomorrow.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the chairman of the company, says that Icelandair will not take a decision on the terminations until the result of the vote is available.
“It’s all very well together,” says L<0xC3><0xAD>ney.
“There have been no cancellations, this has to be put in place so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, people are eager to know if there will be work after the monthly meeting.”
The agreement was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that aviators had previously included in the vote.
On 17 July, the Board and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Airfreight Company approved the announcement of an all-army cease-fire at Icelandair, the shareholders approved it in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to stop negotiations with the airline, terminate all its air carriers and seek agreements with another airline.
Then the airline’s pilots would have to take over the duties of the security team on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney says it’s hard to say.
“People are hurt by this Icelandair incident, when all of the airline’s flight attendants were terminated and announced that another airline would be contracted.
“We’ll see if it has any effect,” she said.
Icelandair had 940 flight attendants at the end of April, with 900 of them, about 95%, laid off.
Their notice period is irregular, with the shortest working life being three months and ending at the end of the month of July-August.
In this group there are about 90% of Icelandair’s flight attendants.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing our discussions with our partners.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the air traffic controllers have gone too far.”
Voting on the collective agreement closes and Icelandair presents its second quarter settlement tomorrow
Voting for a new nuclear agreement will be held at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s second quarter results will also be released tomorrow, but provisional results indicate that the company’s revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting procedure for the Iceland Air Free Society’s collective bargaining agreement and the Icelandic Working Life Partnership for Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who can vote for the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay social security contributions to the airline.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday night, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had cut talks with the airline after air traffic controllers struck an earlier agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had told all of the airline's airmen and crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new airline agreement was signed.
Under the new agreement, flight attendants are required to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear agreement is valid until 2025, but it has already integrated the provisions of the pilots and air traffic controllers on how long they can fly on one watch.
The deal was announced to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many aviators as news outlets spoke to them about their dissatisfaction with the deal.
Most agreed, however, that it would have to agree to the agreement to keep the FF<0xC3><0x8D> alive.
Icelandair's second quarter settlement will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating income for finance and taxes, is negative, according to preliminary financial results, by 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or by 15 billion Icelandic kroner.
Icelandair sent the company’s interim accounts last Wednesday, saying the company’s revenue had been about $60 million in the fourth quarter, or about $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents amounted to about 154 million U.S. dollars, or about 21 billion crowns.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair is aiming to finalise contracts with 15 lenders, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the start of the equity auction.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“The new weather just means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been messed up at home," says M<0xC3><0xA1>r Kristj<0xC3><0xA1>nsson, head of the infectious diseases department of Landspitalan, about which they say that "a new type of virus" has been detected here in the country.
Three were found at the border yesterday and two at the border.
One who was identified had participated in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football match, but the origin of the infection is unknown and infection is ongoing.
A person who arrived in the country on July 15 and two who were in contact with him were also diagnosed with the symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, an infection related to an infection that was reported yesterday was detected, and after a serial analysis by the Icelandic Genetic Analysis, “a new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was revealed.
The infection has been closed in connection with the infection.
The virus is not a new virus, but rather a virus that has spread around the world, namely the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to speak of a new variant of that virus than of a new type of virus.
When asked what it means and whether it could say anything about the beginning of another wave of disasters, M<0xC3><0xA1>r says that as if there were a single incident, it could happen so that nothing more could be done about it.
“However, if there are domestic cases that are not related from abroad and have the same genotype and this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [on the second wave], but it is premature to support it,” explains M<0xC3><0xA1>r.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is it a secret that the happiness of Icelanders is hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC’s daily journalists are leading the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hotpot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many baths per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is the basis of it, but also the tradition of fusion that prevails here.
Child health education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are nevertheless able to use their hot water for health benefits.
Health trips are described as an integral part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of their position and position.
Free from mobile phones, people talk together on personal notes about home and space or take advantage of the similar power of water: meditates and recharges the batteries of souls and bodies.
On the ramp to fetch a hundred days in elections
There are hundreds of days until the United States goes to the polls and elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he has yet to seek re-election.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s likely candidate, has a lot of headway on Trump nationwide, according to pollsters.
According to a recent AP poll, the U.S. believes the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans are counting on it than before the president has been doing badly on the economy.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say the U.S. is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump’s response to the crisis, and 48 percent say he has kept up with the economy.
In March it was 56 per cent and in January it was 67 per cent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden’s attendance is 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump’s attendance is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift the focus from his performance against the tide to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural divides and announcing policies that should turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s offer does put a lot of effort into keeping Trump’s attention, and he believes there’s a good chance of winning by-elections if the election is really about how Trump has been doing in the last four years.
Trump’s animosity also seems to be coming down on Republican lawmakers and Republicans fear that Democrats could even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate Senate, which so far has been highly successful.
Politico has said in recent days that the adherence of the parties and the candidate is comparable and that it is now that the Republican Party would enjoy its greatest influence in decades.
Outwardly, the party proved particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare off suburban residents to follow him, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will demolish the U.S. suburbs and push racial divides.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged “housewives” of the US subcontinent to read an article by former New York aide-de-camp, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the US subcontinent and subjugate Trump.
“The bid will ruin your neighborhoods and your American dreams.
I will preserve it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The population of the United States is an ever-increasing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Only in 2012 did Mitt Romney win the majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that even though Trump secured a narrow majority in the 2016 sub-divisions, his followers have been significantly drawn together.
Although there is a difference between the investigations, Biden has measured about a fifteen percent lead on Trump in the polls recently.

Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the corridor?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that has only been witnessed by World War II, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic Games would be "the light at the end of the world," and pointed to the inevitable end of the world.
Africans have an extra year to prepare and the authorities in Japan are adding to the cost of the delay.
Everyone has a big head in their hands.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympics this year, the Japanese representatives’ joy was unwavering.
They cried and laughed for a while, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but it was divided into a lower one held for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to be bathed in the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year, starting on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If they fail to keep the games then, if the coroner is still too much of a threat, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
The Olympic Games are not a regular sports competition.
There is nothing to save, the show must always be magnificent and strive to top the last game.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the election committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation, the more likely it is to attract the bear.
Tokyo won 150 million dollars in an attempt to host the 2016 Olympics, or a grand total of 20 billion crowns.
The second time, when applied for the 2020 Games, there were 75 million dollars, about ten billion crowns, put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent a total of SEK 30 billion on the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the ocean, given how much it costs to build an Olympic village, a stadium and, in general, to strengthen the infrastructure of the country to handle such a tournament, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be in progress these days but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by Japan’s state auditor released at the end of last year found that the cost was closer to double that number.
A full assessment of the cost of delaying the games will probably not be possible, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run in the range of 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so high numbers that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state only amount to about half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympiads are events of such magnitude that they have tended to become a topic of discussion for economists, who try to analyze the numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest possible time, many seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the countries that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs is very high in the short term, but for the longer term cities tend to sit up with debt holders and the alarming operating costs of low-utility structures.
R<0xC3><0xAD>o in Brazil is sitting up with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been struggling to afford maintenance on all the major sports facilities built for the games.
Figures from the London 2012 Games have shown that only 10 per cent of those who got a job related to the Olympics in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that it was not about a new job, except in a small way.
In general, cities have not come out very well financially to hold the Olympics because of the falling costs that come with the buildings built for the games.
However, the benefits are likely to be felt in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is, however, very uncertain regarding the Games in 2021.
It is also unclear whether all the number of spectators who habitually download the games will be able to be accommodated.
The main thing, however, is the honor that cities deserve to be elected, but it is difficult to value for money.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not the nature of being able to put a price on it.
But even if the show is great and there is nowhere to save, of course, it is not just about money.
It’s the athletes who are at the forefront.
For some Africans, it’s a surprise that they’re only welcome to postpone the games.
Australian five-time champion and gold medalist Chloe Esposito, for example, is a cassock and would have been far from having fun this summer but hopes to be in competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is, therefore, among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, the suspension of the games in some cases means that they quit the competition before the games take place.
Relying on your body simply does not have to go through years of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were as thoroughly represented in the hearts of the audience at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games as the five-time star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is going to the games in 2021, but she is not sure if she will still be at the top of the games next year, after which she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is in a higher order for a five-legged woman in the front row.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles in another interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page asking if she plans to achieve as much in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after a whole year of practice,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the load that accompanies fitness training much longer.
However, she is still training to compete for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly have to stop exercising when the world age was at its highest and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sportsmanship activities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympians could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
It’s certainly better than most people’s.
“We have a very tight schedule now.
It was difficult to start practicing again first after the opening of the gym.
We started off well, but we’ve made a full recovery and I’ll be adding to the exercises evenly and tightly depending on what happens next year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be played or whether they will be held, but we still practice given that they will be, we can not do anything else.
I’ve been putting too much pressure on myself to leave the sport now,” says Biles.
With it, like many others, doubts or perhaps rather awareness that the situation may arise that the players will not be held in 2021 at all either.
However, predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the world-famous coronavirus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics, given that they will be held next year.
Perhaps the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid pandemic.
Postponed wedding due to an emergency
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
“We definitely want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have everyone present who is dear to us.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what’s important right now and it’s helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at the world than at weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what’s happening in the world.”
