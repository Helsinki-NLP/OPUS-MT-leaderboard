Tom lent me his bike.
Tell them we don't want to go.
She's been spotted.
I had nothing to do.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary answers the teacher’s question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
I like to dance.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're a lot faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling. Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning. Good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're gonna get for the exams.
I think two languages are not enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should call them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're much smarter than I am.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's gonna be home at 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom's teaching me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
Raw fish is not to my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student from Jutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is that okay?
What is the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you work?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
The flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love the flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to do it.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sorry.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
My cell phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
It's 2:30 now.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was inside his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who's this for?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name is not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a commonplace with hippies.
The water is warm.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Is anyone here yet?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than in the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you dye your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We're in love.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We might need some.
That's a proposition.
How'd you spend your vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here, do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom's got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary took a picture of her mother on her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
He does the same to me whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be late.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I've never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You're 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Uh, about.
Where's your friend?
Do you know of any Greek myths?
He's turned 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a dictionary of French.
Captain's got us all set.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Laurie's still at school.
My office is in the city center.
She has two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom interrogated Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to think you're tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's screaming.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks fluently in French.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your earphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom's your teacher.
The news delighted him.
We were enemies.
Who's got it?
We have nowhere to go.
How many squares can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Tom drinks every day.
The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I'm the coach.
Tom's going to work this afternoon.
Who is she?
Dinner's over.
She convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the jokes.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom painted the wall pink.
We're very busy.
Louder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe out of your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he shouted.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy-going.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I was able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys are not mine.
She was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and I say it again.
Open up the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Are you learning Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You've ruined it.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for long.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I pretended to be asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow made it difficult to see.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something for us.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
Did you think I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I have not received an answer to my letter.
Can I borrow your gun?
Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom's a Turk.
Can you take away from ten to six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When are you going on vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's an emergency.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There was no salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
Yeah, I know.
I burst into tears.
He's talking like a truck driver.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It's gonna be hard.

When I was sick, Tom came and prepared dinner for me.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
Seven is considered a lucky number.
Where are your dresses?

I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
I haven't worked since I got married.
Why do you hate Canada so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a sheep?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you can't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's a slow walker.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
His father's Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was a dangerous man.
What time do they start?
I'm stupid now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like to play the piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What are you reading?
We're not happy.

Where do you speak French?
You know you're getting old when you have to explain to a Greek who Melina Mercouri was.
Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First, God

He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?

We didn't have any tea left.
All the guests are gone.
Who killed Tom? Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I was born in Canada.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I wasn't part of the conversation.
Attention: In English and we praise the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build stores?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril; I am glad to meet you!
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we've been up to.
You'll eat.
The problem is that you are not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
He's coming?
Tell us where to go.

How much do you want to be paid?

That's exactly what you need right now.
I did some research.
Do you feel tired?
"It's still shallow, isn't it? My feet are still touching the bottom." "It's quite a shallow beach. Yotsuba, you're still reaching the bottom, aren't you?"
I went to London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid of losing your money?
It's cold; why don't you wear a sweater?

Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Get me a glass.

If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.

Everything all right?
You're amazing.

My brother's staying in Boston.
What are you reading?
All right, thanks.
Only I can save you.

I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was looking impressed.
I get drunk at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.

Answer the question.
The problem is that you are not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.
I'd like you to give me an explanation.

You're working hard.

Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom's decided to get out of Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very angry right now.

There's a lot of trouble here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of the three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I assume you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.

There?
Where'd you get the key?

Bill, call me at night.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please, tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of porn magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a very rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Oh, thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.

Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary is wary of strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life's hard.
Who is Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door open.
I live here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk to me later.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom's hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom got married to a Canadian.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?

We only have three options.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.

Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
The French are not difficult.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
It all repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do you speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom go for a swim.
How long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay still.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a story.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father is missing.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.

My job is to teach English.
This brings me great joy.
Tell them I won't do this.

He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?

His response was negative.
I understand them.
You're still alive.
How old is he?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really a Canadian? No.
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.

You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job but he was promised promotion very soon.

You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I love the snow, it's so beautiful!

You underestimated them.
Throw her out.

I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is near the beach.
We're going to build a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You will learn to speak English fluently.
That's fantastic.

Tell them I won't do this.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's cooking.
I was scared.
It is better to teach a man how to fish than to give him a fish.

I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.
I'm at a friend's house.
Have you slept at all?
I thought it was a bad dream.
We know what the problem is.
I don't think it's fair.
I'm Mexican, I speak fluent Spanish.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help.
Tom wanted me to learn French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
You speak Spanish?
You're weak.
Where's the paper?
He went home on foot.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where does he live?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Tell them not to come.
It's not expensive.
The knife on the table wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my soy.
Is that your car?

Why are we poor?
Tom's naked from the waist up.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm expecting you in two.
Bring them with you.
Give me your money.

It's not my fault.
Can you answer that?
I have to be there before seven.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Tom insisted on helping Mary out.
Tom's going to graduate in October.

I didn't think it would be so easy to do that.
Hold on a second.
Tom's gonna get Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.
The city has changed a lot since then.
They're ours.
Our team has good players.
I always put my team first.
I have a lot of friends who live in Boston.
That's not a fish.

We were both very thirsty.
Why did you paint the bench red?

Do you speak a language other than English?
Tom's too slow.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When's your birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.
I'm thirty years old.
How was the beach?

I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's very strange.
I like China.

It'll rain tomorrow.
I just said a big stupid thing.
The house collapsed.
Put the book in the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Do you eat meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand you.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all came running out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's in vain.
Tell them it's important.
The party's on Sunday.
Here we are all Canadians.
Listen to him sneeze.
Tom sent you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is that word pronounced?
He saved me.
I came up with an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get drunk.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom's got black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?
I just finished the bathroom.
We're not gonna change anything.
Look what I did!
Tom's a Harvard graduate.
You have thirty days.
Tom bought a little present for Mary.
The Russian language is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother tongue in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, albeit without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the constituent republics of the Union.
Tom said you'd be here.
A lot of tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm older than her.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three years old."
Let's get some water.
I wish I was born a Canadian.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
We recognized them.
A lot of candles were lit.
