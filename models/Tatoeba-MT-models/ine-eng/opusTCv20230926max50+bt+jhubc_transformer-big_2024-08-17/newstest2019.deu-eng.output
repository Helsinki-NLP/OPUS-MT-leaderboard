Nevertheless, the nine "beautiful Munchner" candidates, while shooting with People photographer Tuan, defy wind, gusts and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
“It’s a question that, of course, depends on once you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrasesm<0xC3><0xA4>her” of the “Bild-Zeitung”.
Despite months of debate over <0xC3><0x96>zil’s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified this by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist animosities during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism to <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim L<0xC3><0xB6>w and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when “you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t come up yet”.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire brigade in Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schreberg species settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and firewood had to be cleared to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had planted a battery for the store at noon.
This could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as does the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What did Lindsay Lohan do to this strange story?
She apparently wanted to kidnap the children of an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live as she apparently wants to tear the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial summary of the stream.
"Kissed to Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, which she wants to have as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
There is no evidence for this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan said in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earwig.
With tears, the actress says how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What motivated Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
The death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 fatalities.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now the two have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is retiring from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
Conservative Party (UK)
The Tories - The Tories
Birmingham becomes the scene of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the population will vote - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The One Who Doesn't") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
Its sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" overhaul takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," development chief Peter Mertens told the industry magazine Autowoche.
In December 2017, Rupert Stadler, the head of Audi, announced that the task force would be disbanded soon.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in working out the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had on Friday postponed a decision on Stadler’s future and wants to discuss further on this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas scams became known.
He knew about the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently heads the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to the DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the post of DFB president next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF’s “Current Sports Studio.”
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association found it "strange" if he did not "like to work on the future project" after the bid for the 2024 football championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected to a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place on DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm will participate in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, is cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become integration ambassadors of the DFB.
Currently, this office is practiced by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background clearly intervenes in society and football and says, 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Properly lose weight with a half-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks now.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
They can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
It doesn’t say anything about whether or not I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear starter sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters), who was obliged from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won at the mandatory play debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among the guests with 24 points.
W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counts.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Frankfurt-based Fraport Skyliners 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most reliable shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball L<0xC3><0xB6>wen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings overtook the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the sneakers quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in action, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Burials and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been campaigning for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was a shot, got scared and tried to flee.
In a short time, panic ensued, and people ran in confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organiser Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the crowd down from the stage.
“Nobody is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience – cheers for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, bringing many women to their knees.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to and including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted by two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
“You can also come with me in an elevator at any time,” Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Journalist's Dismissal
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said to the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the press conference.
The journalist’s action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he's got the bodyguards to get the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate claim or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement.
The Turkish leadership blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Y<0xC3><0xBC>cel had caused excitement.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still underway in Turkey against the two.
M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for its lively conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour cinema "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink up for the obligatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hottest Day".
The Municher did not get a good trip to the high north.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely washed-out Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some – perhaps not entirely serious – insights that he has now gained: “Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half-past three, also leaves.
The 43-year-old’s alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the nausea.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls or – probably the most effective – headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
It is not known how Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller survived the nightly soufflelag.
But since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and mistrust
The entrance to the 36 kilometer long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country in Treysa is difficult to find and muddy.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill in Treysa presents itself since a long time.
A more than infamous sight for the showcase object Bahnradweg in Rotk<0xC3><0xA4>ppchenland.
Members of the ADFC-Lotsgruppe Schwalmstadt but also others have been working on the topic for a long time, according to the city’s cycling commissioner Ulrich W<0xC3><0xBC>stenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the cycling council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the point of entry.
"I think the last one would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says W<0xC3><0xBC>stenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the pavements are also destroyed: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent over, seat furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drops on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for sowing.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling commissioner, who now also takes care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to be entangled in communal utility.
This would, however, require a police raid to be over in a timely manner.
In principle, W<0xC3><0xBC>stenhagen wants a development of the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the attendance of the bike path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," according to the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascher<0xC3><0xB6>der Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Treysa.
There is no turning back on the Ha<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
With heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "K<0xC3><0xB6> von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in each other.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winks of the eye in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering for coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations appeared, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albatross, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Zwenderlich and Zw<0xC3><0xA4>rtle from Trengarkamp and Claus.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see connected with?
In the towns, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig called the alley "K<0xC3><0xB6> von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The cultural centre was also appreciated.
It was always about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Thus it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has put everything on YouTube in the meantime.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special about the jury’s favourites, however, so that others could hear their songs as well.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina T<0xC3><0xB6>lle.
Like everyone else, the children appeared again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfa<0xC3><0x9F> from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, which contains four cards with keywords that you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you have inserted them.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can not read anything even by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Cubes.
4th Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the Encryptor.
He gets a code card that says maybe "3.4.2. ".
In "Decrypto" should be guessed not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "ducks", "fest" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because this wins the game if he manages to break the code twice.
So the coder notes and reads aloud: "throws" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to solid; of course, here too such a thing as "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he took care of the school and knows the fall of the window there.
This is how it goes round by round, team by team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can better rhyme with any hint that the cipher gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the rewrites should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But who has just started, will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
In general, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it’s just about guessing and not winning points, you can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday equally twice.
At first he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police raid, later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized did not comply with the given place transfer by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspectorate Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the state of emergency, he must then also be criminally responsible for the use of trademarks of organizations that are contrary to the Constitution.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
For decades, the railway plant in Pressig was the turning point in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you heard it all the time," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the station.
That didn't bother anyone.
The brakes also stopped and the wagons cracked.
It was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp-mountain route to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, earlier train and Schubloks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, driving line and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the turntable, which after a reconstruction in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years professional railway operator.
The Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which became Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and Schubloks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 cars were still being driven per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you did not take into account a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg Railway Directorate celebrated the 50th anniversary of the electrification of N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg-Saalfeld, a pompous station festival in Pressig.
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it's off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were pulled down, and the Pressig ranger station was history.
"The rangers and brake guards did the most difficult work in train transport," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, just like Julia G<0xC3><0xB6>rges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The sister-in-law is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mitteleehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air grounds of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been with us since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Slightly surprised, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into the hands of proven young people with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have co-designed flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at each art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framework.

50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtens also aired their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to settle for the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia" there should be no more singing in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the tin bush, they lifted the MGV 68 albaques from the christening.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of encounter".
"It's going to be full today," suggested Chairman J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachtene singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the tradition festival was back.
An elegant ball it became to festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Meeting" in rows of seats, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was in demand: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made their voices heard.
Suitable for the occasion were happy songs.
As the saying goes, “A day as beautiful as today.”
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "R<0xC3><0xBC>desheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hope".
Again sovereign was the choir conduction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his guidance," Holsteige said, "He has such an easy way, it's a masterful feat that he accomplishes." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singly.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascendant is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC M<0xC3><0xBC>nster under the patronage of Axel B<0xC3><0xBC>ring finds itself quite well in League three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
“It wasn’t crystal clear, but we’ve already made an impression,” says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker said: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was chopped off.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish line, such a game can already tip over," B<0xC3><0xBC>ring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the target.
"We all know who is on the other side of the Derby.
That doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not bother with the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents is going, after just three days of play, seems unpredictable.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel B<0xC3><0xBC>ring.
Only in one can he feel confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga-Volleyball this is not nearly comparable". In the fourth league, they do not want to look down anymore.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they need to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she is openly talking about the fact that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left forever.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone, and many colleagues I admired caught my eye,” says Keller in conversation with the “Image on Sunday”.
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She believes it is possible that her then husband might have been quite jealous, but "how many men did Hans also shy away from conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one who was right and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have adjusted," as she further explains.
She had always felt that "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas H<0xC3><0xA4>rtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why has it never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I’ve been too naive about love.”
The Night Plover, who regularly explores the city’s nightlife at the NZZ-Ressort Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich, has this time ventured into the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a bit shy.
And the gleaming brilliance in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-legged square blinds him over fee.
But it is still a film festival, because more or less celebrities want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he thunders over the square to ease himself into the "Aquaclean toilet oasis" for a while.
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needs centre on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the men's oasis smells like heaven for some reason.
So get out here, across to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just had a great time in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store like every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are known to come from all over the world.
What you don’t have to think about in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneaky advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The wrinkler ties a ribbon around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bullish doorkeepers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the guests push themselves, they dance far after midnight to live music or let themselves be dictated by DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with C<0xC3><0xBC>pli.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters are waiting for sizzling mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain is sprinkling.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the shield at the escalator: "Please wear a long dress, be careful on the escalator".
If there are two separate instructions, it has become part of the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives already.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultryman flips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, which a capsule manufacturer presents itself with, does not necessarily win the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
Its main protagonist may not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks right through the crowd, with almost sixty acting like a choir boy.
He is not beaten, he is not puffed up, he hides at most stolen.
Especially for this reluctance, often misunderstood as clumsiness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have made a good living in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second leg had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training for the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: USA Send to last-minute match "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association league ASV send, could hardly grasp: "So a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against H<0xC3><0xBC>llhorst - over long periods of time, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have totally slept", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken at first did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
At the break, the gap was only two more goals.
In particular, Senden’s bester, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst made it to 15:15, then the season changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Engage the unpartisans in the action.
Bieletzki usually avoids finding fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen M<0xC3><0xBC>hlhoff conceded "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, also in the back against seven men well and repeatedly threw on the empty gate.
Only they can buy themselves little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come," said the restless serving Bieletzki.
US goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schl<0xC3><0xB6>gl (4), Kretschmer (3), K<0xC3><0xBC>mper (2), M<0xC3><0xBC>hlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Emergency forces dug up a road near Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers of it were removed, as the police and the prosecutor’s office shared.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from her home at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Public Prosecutor’s Office, has been working on the information on the case again intensively.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Office for the Protection of Monuments, the investigators encountered a conspicuousness under the road near Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it hurt to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, the founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk will serve as chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
The head of the board may stay.
In the comparison, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not at fault.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the funding being secured.
That would have put Tesla at $72 billion.
Musk later said, “Tesla will stay on the stock market.”
After the deal, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 at FC Chelsea
Liverpool came to a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the striker just substituted by coach J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp in the 89th minute for the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remain third, new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard led Chelsea in the 25th minute with his sixth meeting of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the balance several times.
National player Antonio R<0xC3><0xBC>diger cleared after a solo by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge released the Reds with a slasher into the corner.
After the worst start to the season since 1989, Manchester United are sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earns 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Prior to the 1899 Champions League game at Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan was not used in the new top rider.
"Let's Dance" Juror Joachim Llambi and Mrs. Ilona Separated
Joachim Llambi has separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known moderator and dance experts.
"Our clients have separated by mutual agreement and friendship," lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told BamS.
The most important thing now is the well-being of their two daughters.
The couple reportedly met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi is from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television for his juror work on the dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as various appearances in quiz and entertainment shows.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, GroKo cashes several survey hits.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a count and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens are 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes – with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4%.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second-largest party in several surveys, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, depending on the proportion of votes, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently want the grand coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed significant declines in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent are against it.
According to the report, 64 percent of EU voters want a candidate, while 35 percent do not.
Aushang at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - you should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for the great love almost exudes an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargains at the W<0xC3><0xBC>hltisch or the favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for the later grandchildren than a simple swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact, but more of a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react when you don’t talk about the hot stuff for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Real Hollywood love story potential is there when love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also reports at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de to his devotees, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this ad in an Aldi branch unknown to us wishes that she would also find her dream man, with whom she talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog dating, she definitely deserved her Happy End <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has participated in the action "Decks against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by poliovirus.
The disease, referred to in German as childhood paralysis, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in which the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, so far can only be contained by vaccinations, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand calm for goths
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to Mario G<0xC3><0xB6>tze's public discussion of form and fitness.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” Reus, who is friends with G<0xC3><0xB6>tze, said after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.

We haven’t even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday night.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher VfL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
He gave up, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, only once retired (inside) to think about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
The whole story.
Meanwhile, it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
Baptismal evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the last season only thinly passed on the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up to each individual after the game, to simply say "thank you" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This would almost have paid off when the SCA in minute 41 twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer dangerously broke up in front of the Wolbecker Kasten - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL boldly took full control.
The 18-yard line failed miserably.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes home inning.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Chris Naberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer of Altenrhein fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the pitchers 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The fouled himself stepped in and demonstrated his dangerousness by standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slap hit bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be a hell of a long time.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute unhappy at hand.
Referee H<0xC3><0xBC>seyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to survive a few minutes in the final stage before Geske had the winning shot in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female on the first day of September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and was submitted to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to behave differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, the foundation's managing director.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-owned leadership teams – with a few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among the German stock exchange companies was also due to positive impulses among the companies of the Index of Medium Values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: as of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If the same number of women were recruited for the boards each year, 40 percent would have been achieved by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make mice: luxury carousels: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenh<0xC3><0xB6>ffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put heavily on it with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well into the race with prices averaging from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>33,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>38,000 per car and around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 profit before interest and taxes.
On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she will become a mother for the first time.
The longtime number one ended her career at the end of last year with 25 Grand Slam titles – five in singles – final.
In July, she married train driver Harald Leemann.
She did not reveal the date of birth.
Torchlight for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torchlight procession, the Tourist Association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on the Rehweiler street.
At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge moved from Wiesenbronn through the town to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug.
In the already crowded festival tent, the Chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of such a thing - this is a feat of madness for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Later, the wine princess Lisa II symbolically kicked the guests off the stage.
"Nice that again so many have found their way to us to Abtswind". Later "Die Troglauer" provided mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, on the occasion of the anniversary, the association had fixed the drinks prices in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, at the guest’s house, before it goes into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Notarztauto force in Taxi
An emergency medical car is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in a collision with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best even save people's lives.
Such a rescue took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision between a ambulance and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided with the taxi at the intersection of Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled at a traffic light and a tree.
He caught the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from the emergency room.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old emergency nurse was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another doctor who had been called to the emergency room tried to do so, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor's office, will determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
Manchester United are now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is 1:3, and the way of defeat is likely to give way.
Symbolic was the scene in the 74th minute in which the revived Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders remained, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative high point of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The mood at United’s city rival Manchester City is quite different at the moment.
Citizens coached by Mourinho’s great competitor Pep Guardiola came to an undefeated 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider’s defence bar for the first time for the home team.
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leaderboard
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League 1-1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-Off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's score in the 25th minute remained the game's only score until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came on the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeaten for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated the team of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victory.
Fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily pushed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal moved past Watford for the fifth straight win and are just behind big rival Tottenham in 5th place, leaving a strong impression on forward Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW’s core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the wake of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in conjunction with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofits should not let German car companies go at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their innovations together with competitors from all over the world in the French capital from next week.
Diesel doesn’t really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, however, should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is scheduled to launch in 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in conjunction with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were over a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquake and tsunami that followed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, huge property damage has occurred.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke over the western coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
The figures so far come only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship service in Werdohl
Motorcyclist-pastor Frank Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a team of helpers the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcycle riders on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the pastoral affairs of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) always takes place on the last Sunday of the month at Haus Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers at the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to perform a service other than ordinary worship.
As early as 10 a.m., the bolidas were lined up in front of the church’s entrance gate.
At first, the biker breakfasts were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a valiant currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker worship service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical underpainting.
"Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetic-calm tones," said parish priest Frank Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship.
F<0xC3><0xBC>chtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Boris was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his amazing audience.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnels.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely shredded mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this should turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to take a look at this important step in their work this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and encased in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little pieces of apple on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the F<0xC3><0xBC>chtorfer farmer also had ready-made specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in F<0xC3><0xBC>chtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into a conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up hop castle for themselves.
Active members of the F<0xC3><0xBC>chtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited to a few stations for entertaining games.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also offer an action day.
Then, however, as Gregor Kr<0xC3><0xBC>tzkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the spargel village will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: After all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-pleite: "Decissed situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and spoke to them with courage.
However, a lot of positives were not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-foot pro Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you're always doing a lot."
The further undefeated Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) came next, are at the very bottom with two counters and are in their current constitution a candidate for the descent.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB-Pokal winner, who after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle.
Croatia’s vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hesse in his debut for the first time and could never be controlled by Hannover’s defence.
The long-sought-after World Cup striker showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to the team.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by FC Liverpool, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began to swing.
Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3>'s headball (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence for the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term loser Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndika only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defensive player who came in the summer from the French second-tier AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to think through and 96-yard goaltender Michael Esser left no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons played a little more courageously forward, but the ideas that ignited remained until shortly before the end, when, after all, the connecting encounter was still possible.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across to De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
For the Frankfurters against overcrowded guests, the rest was only show runs, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Despite cold temperatures, the Oktoberfest in the city centre was in a good mood.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter succeeded in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n in the last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier according to the legend.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
To this day, it is not finished, only the altar room is standing, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesial part of the crucifixion ended.
For many years now, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting us to the Catholic parish home for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather-adapted farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding had been standing for some time, the damage could be detected more accurately and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has become greater, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by means of the eye certification by scaffolding.
The plinth work is completed, before the winter is about to begin with the natural stone works and it is hoped to be able to finish well half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
The Life Support Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities in the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
That in the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e is now handed over "a very special house" to its destination - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for residents with cell phone caps: “The house had come into the years and was no longer up to date in equipment,” Bader explained, looking back.
In 2016, the excavators set out to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residential home
Around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Support, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof design has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that let the inhabitants experience the freedom to move even without the help of strangers.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need help to be mobile."
The comfort and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real fortune, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all members of parliament not to settle for the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Dayspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the wedges between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon’s office on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their receiver as early as Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the animals’ “habituation”.
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to compete together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria’s moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now, numerous new books have appeared that answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the actual work - this is the unofficial motto for today's working week of the Grand Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU recently did not propose the "return to substantive work" in a mantra-like way.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and otherwise working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is the difference between work and actual work, but let's face it.
If the federal government is now on the verge of devoting itself to its mission again - to government - it should not be held back by conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blasphemies of the last few weeks, will perhaps already show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties meet on the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to de-escalate conflicts early; a lesson from all the controversy.
First of all, the issue of diesel retrofits and the skilled immigration law are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has been approaching over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a housing perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strictly against the "change of tracks" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be a dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined GroKo, but three partners with partly very different corporate images and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without dispute, a society characterized by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be restructured on the question of being or non-being for partisan reasons.
This is about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the track change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the people’s parties must fight for it now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in charge
Is the Minister of Labour in breach of applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real day and night" their legists had worked on the social insurance reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes as a surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the use of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "free Har tinger from any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, it has been excavated on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgruen area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters, together with its guide, in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Office for the Protection of Monuments, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said roadway.
For more than a year, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Criminal Police Court have been investigating the missing person’s case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgr<0xC3><0xBC>n and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the new construction of the state road Heikes body could have been blocked 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that, there were riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence supporters, among other things, with paint powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who were in office last year at the illegal referendum in the polling stations.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 or so separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials, among other things, threw paint bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, authorities said.
On Monday, the independence referendum will take place for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in the fall of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the coercive administration was ended.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Aggregate lack of advice: FC G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloh and RW Ahlen split without a goal
Red and white acorns continue to appear on the spot.
Even at FC G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third last one were displayed in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a total lack of advice.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a sausage could do this without any worries.
There was no risk of missing a shot, as there were practically none.
First shot in half an hour
G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best – and, in principle, the only real – opportunity for the Ahlens was when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Ayg<0xC3><0xBC>n came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian M<0xC3><0xBC>tzel scored from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour the G<0xC3><0xBC>tersloher also appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball-taking by Matth<0xC3><0xA4>us Wieckowicz, things went well.
Nick Flock (62) "crowned" the quickly presented counter over Sinan Ayg<0xC3><0xBC>n with a soft shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed up with a headball from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes G<0xC3><0xBC>ney for Sebastian M<0xC3><0xBC>tzel (70).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlens did not bring about.
Only in the 91st minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to put out the positive: "I like that we have played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as against wooden wickets and although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively "plotted everything a bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn’t feel we could get a goal,” Daut said.
However, as a spectator, he did not feel that his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Issuer, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky turned bright blue, the place was still a bit empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice sociable, that's why we are here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough critters.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the ever-increasing visitors musically in between.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung at a later time.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many actives with their stands, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful painting - here goes something.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Kl<0xC3><0xBC>ck with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
At many stands, work was done for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decoupage saw.
Furnishings, beer lids with Reckenfelder motifs and much more he had on offer.
A specialty offered by three Reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschschl<0xC3><0xBC>ter.
The latter still has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably promoted the construction of a skating rink in a way that is hardly conducive to promotion.
In several places there are appropriate lubrication plants, says J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark f<0xC3><0xBC>r Lengerich!" appear on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the billboard at the stairway to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily have been removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising label must be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, it should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have dealt with the subject of skating.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the fire service parking lot.
However, this assumption was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is from the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Tightness in air traffic control becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight outages is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," the union said.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept away.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal government, the countries, the air traffic control, the airlines and the airports come together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Federal Aviation Safety Agency.
Maas once again made the EU Commission’s guidelines responsible for the pilot-missiles.
The traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period up to 2019 have been much too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings for national air traffic controllers are now fully dependent on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to push for regulations in Brussels that "do not detach the air from the fuselage even further".
At present, the EU's targets are set to be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high costs of delay for airlines will prompt a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a “single training and future pact”, Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related dropouts.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Expansion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the fused steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police officers and Catalan pro-independence activists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence supporters in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 independence supporters demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large order to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to the emergency forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and bullets.
According to the information, there were queues also between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better Salaries and Appreciation of Colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had gone against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government almost exactly a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil consider it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona alone.
“Why did they come here to protest?” 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threatened us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, denied the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British minister
A security breach in a mobile app has meant that the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party's Birmingham congress.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, Hannover police reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the local exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car towards a tree.
The car is currently on fire.

Football: Juve coach praises by top scorer: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker played "this evening the best game together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early setback by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst pursuer for now.
The goalkeeper, who was picked up by Real Madrid, initially put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also made the preliminary work on the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just before the goal line had to push in.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see goals from the striker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to be even better at serving him,” the coach demanded.
The best Juve goaltender is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in the Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the last seven years has already six meters ahead of Naples.
Former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti’s second-place finish against Turin was not without its chances.
But at the latest, after the transfer of the already warned Mario Rui (58), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to take a hard start against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the pitch.
“We played well against a good Napoli,” commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can could also be mentioned here.
The German national player prevailed at Juve.
The professional came from Liverpool and was used in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changed his name.
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided frowns and question marks for the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince as he dropped his artist name.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 M<0xC3><0xBC>nster: Finally!
You did it!
Hoetmars coach Averhage did not make a hole out of his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more agile, we almost never put him in any trouble." The list of Hoetmarer shooting possibilities reads accordingly thin.
Score two goal chances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Fu<0xC3><0x9F>ball-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two options in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparation by Krause he defended freely.
The hosts only had a double chance when initially Moritz H<0xC3><0xB6>ne to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher failed and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75).
It was only when Nils Berheide kicked the ball over the line that the game was decided (81st).
“We had previously criticized each other harshly, which was different today than in the last few weeks,” Florian Kraus said.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red Card: Kortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 M<0xC3><0xBC>nster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to say,” he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he said, presumably referring to the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kr<0xC3><0xB6>ger, but probably also to all the other green-whites who came up with a collective offensive urge.
Still, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on His players, on the other hand, was the relief of noting that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“That was by far our best performance of the season,” he says.
"As we come back after the 0-2, as we hold against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it seems that now you have to drive home empty-handed.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed 2-0 on the left for Fabian Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hning (39).
We knew that, but such a player can not be taken out completely.
"It was crazy what he did," Lewandowski said, acknowledging the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf managed to make up for it: McGill’s free-kick from the left sailed between H<0xC3><0xB6>velmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45th).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
N<0xC3><0xBC>bel shocked Albachten again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalled (69th).
Despite overtime, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We now need to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohb<0xC3><0xBC>cker, Adolph, Zur M<0xC3><0xBC>hlen - Kr<0xC3><0xB6>ger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - H<0xC3><0xB6>velmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 N<0xC3><0xBC>bel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 J<0xC3><0xBC>lkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg and FV Biberach.
The leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Dynamo Dresden's entire board resigns
The entire board of football duo Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
In the evening, several media outlets unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Saxon body.
There was no confirmation of the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is supposed to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga players.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure to Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the price of tolerance personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Academy director Udo Hahn counted on him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". That the Academy in the Schloss Tutzing repeatedly featured celebrities, but was also a topic at the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Waker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann attends a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is a title of the meeting.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death – war mocks any human idea".
From structural racism in society to the scissor between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Hahn said: “A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions.”
At a meeting of the 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday is soon expected by one more visitor to the direction of capitalism’s criticism, the other more of a tendency “from left to center”.
What about the neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westf<0xC3><0xA4>lische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner began to understand gender, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben S<0xC3><0xBC>verkr<0xC3><0xBC>p was sitting on the wing.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes even comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenial harmoniously accompanied by S<0xC3><0xBC>verkr<0xC3><0xBC>p Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There were also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction comes to the man, if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have come out of Mozart’s composition, if “the Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
So S<0xC3><0xBC>kr<0xC3><0xBC>p glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g minor symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers was presented to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of electric car maker Tesla, but must resign as chairman of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk’s surprise announcement from August to want to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its lawsuit of making false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, the police have slightly corrected the number of victims.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All of them have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released during the day, a police spokesman said.
It is still unclear the cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was unbraked frontally against a guide board.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleners had problems especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
“Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn’t get them under control,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
Concentrated in the end, his team missed this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end of a setback, lying at 11:12 and later still at 15:18 (45th).
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hosts become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put the back room Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushk<0xC3><0xB6>tter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-leg downhill VC Allbau Essen, the Blue-Whites won with 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
That is what we have now worked out," coach Dominik M<0xC3><0xBC>nch said after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the collapsed leaderboard.
The first pass was dominated by guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Food accepted in the double bar, but did not come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent took a high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has changed the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn't keep up with the pressure.
Food has been range-sucking, and we’ve let ourselves in a bit,” M<0xC3><0xBC>nch continued.
At 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their noses in the front for the first time.
At 19:24, East Bevern defended four more set balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the practice leader said at the rising level.
Maike R<0xC3><0xBC>dingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
M<0xC3><0xBC>nch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-and-white pass brought four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, R<0xC3><0xBC>dingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the grand Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of rubble in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be brought together with difficulty," TGD chairman G<0xC3><0xB6>kay Sofuoglu told the German news network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance to make a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining Muslims' affiliation to Germany with top German politicians, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The large-scale exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it’s Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreffen in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day it was a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our popular meeting would take place so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Whether it’s stormy Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the chimney room of the office has always been full.
"As always, the programme at the next folk meeting is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old beats," says Karl-Heinz Steverm<0xC3><0xBC>er, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first folk-meeting "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the move with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Fr<0xC3><0xB6>sche nacht" delighted the listeners and sent them home with an ear worm.
"We are counting on many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," the invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get involved is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there in time.
The public meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that South Korea and the United States still have the permits for the multi-billion dollar merger, and as the biggest hurdle, the United States still faces.
Recently, the chances of approval had improved there, according to an insider, because Linde has promised the sale of additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open issues must be resolved by October 24 in order for the merger to succeed.
From Pure Fruit Farming to Ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and landscaping was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses for the Kulmbach district association for horticulture and landscaping were set, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he had a different name at the time: as "district fruit building association Kulmbach city and country" he was raised from the baptism by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the Age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Dippold, the district homekeeper.
Fruit trees should be lined with long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were created in schools.
Today, fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Maulw<0xC3><0xBC>rfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Reif, the district president, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather similar joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter S<0xC3><0xB6>llner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, highlighting the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county left no doubt about it, as did district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was plastered.
At the end of the 50s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the specialist for fruit and nut trees argued.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let down, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the dramatic decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Reif the successful festival, which was solemnly framed by the turf blowers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister postpones UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: They are setting an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now accords absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York due to the time pressure in the fight for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will only speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, it is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the U.S. negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the U.S.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August to a new version of the regional free trade agreement, Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be brought to a conclusion, the Trump administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in an open street during an election campaign in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xA3>o" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had mainly called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaro made racist and women-hating statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore was not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
Haddad, the former mayor of the million-dollar city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a by-election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for fighting gays and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked by verbal skirmishes.
Another time he said the supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.

After Long Illness: Danish Rock Legend Died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer J<0xC3><0xB6>rn Jeppesen told Larsen’s website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars L<0xC3><0xB6>kke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" provide such a rewrite of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Civic Center Shoe Factory.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no sign of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and impressive interplay.
Although "Addition" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai H<0xC3><0xB6>lscher demonstrate with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-loading rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from T<0xC3><0xB6>nnish<0xC3><0xA4>uschen has gained a special degree of fame since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that “The Ignition” with its performances in front of a very large audience – recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China – has special stage experience is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also set his own accents in the band's only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejuvenated solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, while he runs through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of such a hard rock concert due to its genre: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixed-pult team at the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press air hammer level, but is thus still clearly under the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", to which "The Ignition" refers on its website.
An ear-damping 120 decibels in jet engine volume, as is the case with the annual metal installation in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night, however.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gangart have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we are, taking the bone saw and lighting a concert night with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One person died in a sailplane accident at Essen/M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen Airport.
A sailplane crashed in a parking lot at M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailplane crashed on the fairground at the airport.
The pilot died in the process.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a single-seater.
The plane was already on the ground at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
There has been an Oktoberfest this weekend.
M<0xC3><0xBC>lheim/Essen Airport is located on the city boundary of the two Ruhr area cities and directly on the driveway to Highway 52.
From the car park there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump tweets Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea’s president, Kim, is well-behaved despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a genuine declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The Tragic: It’s a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old bud of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it turns out to be rather tough chunks in the fight for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was tough, and between us it went back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim’s announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
That the affection for the notorious “Rocket Man” — Trump’s nickname for Kim — might not be for everyone, seemed to the U.S. president quite aware.
In any case, he took the expected criticism when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling just in advance: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidency.
But he didn’t care much, Trump said, pointing his index finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you, it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then out there wouldn’t push 10,000 people into this bumpy arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well visited, atmospheric and, above all, spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler’s city centre has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the festival tent at the Fire Tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and distributed it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The footage was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who shot the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he, according to his own statement, put himself in danger of death.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organizing the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home countries this year through the programme, IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile video.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the Volksschule town on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lesson for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the hallway of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the front square.
The teacher informed the police, who took up the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, telephone number 059 133 4244.
A German man was trapped in his own car for days.
A 75-year-old man in a forested area in central France has had to endure several days and nights in his car after he drove the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a drive in his SUV over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, urged the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is particularly true of the wave of arrests, the freedom of the press and of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet, according to his own information, also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been briefly transferred to a building of the air readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place on Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint performance at the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact point - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the U.S.: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump won’t get tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a meeting of Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions during the UN General Debate.
“The latest shutdown is because the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly to building trust,” Ri said in New York.
Under these circumstances, disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," he said.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea to its knees is “a dream come true for people who don’t know us.”
To build confidence, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri said.
However, there was no "appropriate response" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council last year alone had approved sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations in recent days to strictly abide by the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the open-door house HoT got nothing with it: white blankets and floral ornaments on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators full of food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how they all got along.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
“It’s better that chefs can’t do it,” one visitor said, as Hokkaido curd soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said parish priest Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other art pieces.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Sator leaves the state board of NRW der Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Table, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Sartor, resigned his post in the National Association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen board had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He resigned as deputy head of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told the "World on Sunday".
I have fallen too many on my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the NRW Board Association, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essen board is doing this".
But Sartor is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach of “without us starving the people in the city”.
It is the duty of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of the boards on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet noise," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me so much back then.
SF Lorch play 2-0 lead - Gm<0xC3><0xBC>nder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a draw - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly lost 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to score a 3-0.
Gladbach plays double lead - Schalke without embolo with first win
Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke maneuvered away four times in the first five league games with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco put back the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Sch<0xC3><0xB6>pf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Yevgeni Konopljanka per head, after which the hosts preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is once again hailing from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2 deficit, but in the 2nd half still came to the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65) and Marco Reus (69) equalled with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86/94) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won their first victory.
Due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen decimated before the break and the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler made a curious throw-in owner who helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang left the lead twice, eventually playing 2:2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20-meter flat shot from the Aargauer, as well as in the second counter-attack after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalie.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record buyout came from OGC Nice for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finished in 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first match of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: the 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey match against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back into the game by a curious throw-in owner (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot back the Stuttgarters acting in excess on the Victory Street.
N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg decided the duel against D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf 3-0 sovereign in itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on course using foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, about 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
If yes, the nearly three-decade-long conflict with Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
Voters will therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The United States had announced that it could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was successful.
Syrians in U-Haft.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian woman brutally beat up three pensioners and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had ransacked on Friday at around 10 p.m. in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they told the accused, who started on passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the floor in the W<0xC3><0xA4>hringer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e at a tram stop shortly before.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two met on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreise, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up an angry debate on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "crushed" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to have their life partnership registered since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example, in the right to adopt.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens’ Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfr<0xC3><0xBC>ndnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schr<0xC3><0xB6>er, chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And it has accumulated so much.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedges have already been sheared.
The breakfast that is always served at work has a long tradition.
“Everyone should stay in power,” said Walter Schr<0xC3><0xB6>er.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic circuit.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the track and everything has been fine today,” said the third Olympian from London 2012.
In the end, he threw his paddle away for joy and raised both arms to victory – knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabled time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
This is how the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained at the single-family house on K<0xC3><0xB6>nigswieser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they escaped without looting.

Hertha's Plea: Real Madrid's challenge to Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to be let down".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small power plant under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to a greater autumn depth for the Munich team.
“A week ago, you still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we have a bit of reality," Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller said after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no own goal was scored abroad, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the leader in the football league lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must still be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks over the outside have delivered within three days as much as two blue breaks, as the last overpowering appearing Bayern are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything to make us successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he and his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again inadequate handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach on Saturday would still leave the first interim conclusion of his term positive - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary game against Ajax begins as planned, which had also triumphantly defeated AEK Athens 3-0 at the start.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The lawyer acted as a janitor in the role.
“I don’t think that’s all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don’t make the many opportunities and make the mistakes,” the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, who now took the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich rated with a wink of an eye at least positively that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB-Boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan of being extradited to Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the League line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for clarity in Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil’s long-running controversy.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally sharply attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced consequences from the cause at the Mainz ZDF-"Sportstudio".
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this does not repeat itself," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration agent.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had harshly denounced racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan.
Our Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph themselves with me in England," Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to G<0xC3><0xBC>ndogan's statement that, in contrast to <0xC3><0x96>zil after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan, he had "reasonably been treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will be appointed in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background clearly intervenes in society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for the office of DFB president again next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/R<0xC3><0xB6>dental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 am and 1 pm.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer H<0xC3><0xB6>he.
She told the pensioner that she was driving against her car.
However, the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a phone call about a driver who had come off the road and was driving towards a control post.
Speaking of which, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the red-tailed man went home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, the pensioner proceeded and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and arrest him.
His car was clearly damaged by an accident.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: almost 1000 emergency personnel still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal military site in the Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, according to one spokesman, the last time 70 volunteers were withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was declared a week earlier on September 21, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was said that the fire was no longer threatening neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency personnel tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornadoes" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was occasionally drawn up to a hundred kilometers far over the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician has married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two met on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreise, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up an angry debate on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "crushed" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to have their life partnership registered since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example, in the right to adopt.
Referendum begins in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be named North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its eponymous northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote Yes, they also give the start for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016 leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registry is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if needed.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on a deputy in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita V<0xC3><0xB6>lker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - pro or con organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or his family members disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head count
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head count.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg, he faced 39 fellow fighters.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Gr<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0x9F> from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest being a 74-year-old pensioner from France, according to Chief Arbitration Judge Ralf Laue.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previously tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Gr<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0x9F> from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greeting was already two years ago as a 14-year-old at that time in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can start small.
"Healing can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even staged computer competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have good chances here, the chief judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because there already in early childhood headcounts were learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and get strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena’s lung were discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time next week in the West: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres with 20 to 40 centimetres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler H<0xC3><0xB6>he, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Gro<0xC3><0x9F>glockner Hochalpenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual care on Monday.
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start the annual curdling on Monday.
The "green walls" that are unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are "forestry set" and for many animals and plants the last refuges.
Knicks connect living spaces scattered as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created by order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time also comes its name "Knick": By "turning" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, about 45,000 kilometers of hedges extend and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometer of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled by the Knick if it is properly cared for in the winter.
Otherwise, it spoils a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knee care can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesians talk about the situation on the ground
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radical Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that relief goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people are partly stealing food and gasoline.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are partly free to walk around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but previously this did not work and we have only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don’t know if they live or where they are staying because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on the way to work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don’t know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought “Okay, no tsunami” – and then he did.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi located on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had pulled a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh at the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player said on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the following national break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
The triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - With the San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Film Festival, the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals close annually.
Despite all the hype about the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching spotted a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stopped in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to catch the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The injured duck was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschlei<0xC3><0x9F>heim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins World Cup medal
In fourth place at Olympia, Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the lost precious metal at the World Championships in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the near-medal to grab.
Seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
"I deliberately took the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the Constitution to a major event, to win something.
Someday you have to hit too.
The World Cup track in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
The time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators to investigate the alleged incidents that occurred more than 30 years ago.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh’s call for a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer threw out angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described Thursday’s heavy protests as a “decision,” initially called for further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, last doubts could be cleared, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They’re trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
Two women’s allegations will be investigated, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: “They’re not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the garden road from Monday, October 1, according to the municipality.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed on.
After all, the K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsblauen had still managed to bring the close 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and pocket.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Sch<0xC3><0xB6>pf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing"., with increasing playing time obviously more and more of the head played a role.
Do not create a head-ball monster
“The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me,” Heidel said, “if the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.”
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all have a huge heart stone," said Sch<0xC3><0xB6>pf, who did not have an insignificant share of it with his headball match: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make it a firework,” said Schalke’s chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach matches over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsblau missed it, rather worried about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," said Tedesco, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I’m glad we won.
He was not the only schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 13:30.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon discovered the cause: an unknown person had set fire to a two-square-meter area on the Gschwendner mountain of garbage.
According to police, it seemed as if he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firemen were engaged in the drawing out and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years now, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the Alliance "Culture Policy" in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters very loosely into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and the one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly arising despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses the question of a metaphor to answer.
The German society sits at a table, and the first generation of immigrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore crucial not to be politically right-wing or left-wing, but to be: “Am I for or against an open society?”
At first rather behave, then the round of discussions starts to get more and more lively.
There is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on stage, as a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, at prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed further.

This is how Schalkes Naldo "great sport" succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues did not sit for the third time in a row in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
However, when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said, "We have to thank, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his reservist appearance, had no qualms.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best striker last season, knows that he did not really get on the track with his coach - but for good reason gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn’t easy to tell him that.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’m telling you quite honestly,” Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn’t in the starting eleven.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can snoop through.
And that we keep all of us in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which Naldo has recently also caught.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued its downhill journey in August compared to the Eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area’s PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50-count mark, which indicates growth.
Ireland’s industry alone broke that threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The final score was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened downhill drive could mean the worst is over,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, the industry remains the number one growth brake.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as they have not fallen since November 2011.
For the seventh month in a row, the companies had to build jobs.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the trends in sales, employment, stocks and prices are highlighted.

Christopher Nkunku (46th) took care of the interim 2-0.
Paris also managed the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
