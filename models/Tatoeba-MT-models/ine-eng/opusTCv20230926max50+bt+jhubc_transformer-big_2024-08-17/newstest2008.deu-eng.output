Food blames European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November – after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been set at just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzsins. At its discretion, the interest rate reduction would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the midst of a crisis: inflation must be “reciprocated” in order to rule out the need for further action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Rising food and energy prices are responsible for rising inflation in the euro area.
MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans has also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose 52 percent this year – last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup is in the midst of a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters has grown considerably by the beginning of December, with the party having the largest base camp since 2002, while the approval of the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among the party loyalists, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate – never before has the proportion of those who consider the country’s economic situation to be “pronounced bad” been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be “quite bad”.
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents – a historic high – rated the prime minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be overcome even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% had spoken out for the stay of the government and the head of government, this share today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would “probably” participate, and another 20 percent would “probably” cast their vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would "certainly" go to the polls, another 15 percent would consider their participation "probably". Given these trends, the result of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day allowance.
The share of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively, of the group of participants "with certainty" in the referendum.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rser commercial area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
In the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rser Handelsdreieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "down" last December, the inflation rate has not fallen drastically, compared to the already high level of the previous baseline.
However, it is certainly discouraging for consumers that what they paid well below HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year’s level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there was 1kg of bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop in the product to below 200 Forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola pfandbottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including pfand cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year's "Napi" basket comparison found the most expensive Auchan cut, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora’s prices in the “Napi” shopping cart compared to last year’s Christmas prices increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 Forint, but the increase in VAT was noticeable at the prices for the last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has made trade angry: it seems that the department stores could not quite decide what price range they should apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans a product’s turnover rate poorly, he can make substantial profits in the price range that depends on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart was so radical last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 Forint more than the previous year, and even the cheapest one there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office found a price increase of more than 30% over a period of 12 months.
So in addition to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, it seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has increased by barely more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to shift the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices at all.
There are purchased from all large quantities, durable food go in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning in all three department stores there were endless queues at the cash register, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Disinfectants are saved in many places
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be carried out because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10, 1094 infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, the lead physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals for sure, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are formed from the well-responsible bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune systems, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are being isolated, the nursing staff is wearing rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, the patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the emergence or spread of the multiresistant pathogen, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Not least because there are no grants for this study from the state health fund.
Most cases will therefore only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients or patients in primary care, according to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Saved by Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to the other by caregivers.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in the local hospitals.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds barely lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz further notes, unfortunately, in the less well-off hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are spared, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes the health insurance companies enormous costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
According to initial indications, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
The police officer was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXIIth district, the official opinion is now available.
The now-retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the Budapest Prosecutor General’s Office’s press spokesman said on Friday, after the official report was submitted to the case.
The expert opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat in the driver’s seat.
The former police chief booked his own car in the 22nd district of Kossuth Lajos Street and drove over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street in an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, after rank .)
The pedestrian has succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his duties and requested retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor's office has launched its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects financed by the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement worth over EUR 50 million, which will mainly be implemented in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 also came to the fore.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth a total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is paying attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most sought-after patch for property purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the riders, however, properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria wid also the interior of the country sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the highly favorable area of Russia recorded more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, and thus, in addition to the summer and winter seasons, also attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Predictive investors are therefore already buying in on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also seek a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or demolished houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value increase.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming more and more expensive due to ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been a price increase of 21 percent annually.
The cost of property prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percents
As Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali Roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate going on between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are ready to support the developing countries, in addition to reducing emissions, both financially and technologically.
An agreement on assistance to developing countries was also reached.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member Council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6 percent
Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "after 2012 agreement" will be achieved successfully or not. The Union would even be willing to commit to a 30% reduction if other major industrial states of the world, or developing countries, are also ready to comply with their commitments.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its then 15 member states.
Hungary's target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will fully meet, as the Ministry of the Environment's press release reads.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012, in which case the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the IPCC, the International Peace Prize, with its significance.
This would delay the emission reduction, and an increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The camera footage, which is mounted on helmets, is checked at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where it is placed on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the goal of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign operations.
This kind of propaganda is almost free compared to conventional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, since they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, also creates a net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not mentioned.
By the way, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "species".
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free-to-download shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-saving simulation.
Christmas celebration with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means clumsy: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a working conference where her employees can finish 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure Christmas mood with raffle or kicks into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how the power is celebrated.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the defense department, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport beat the strings.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs’ 4.32 million-forint Christmas celebration will be held in the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the Council of State Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rent amounted to 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible parties.
What's with the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to the guests of the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was reported that there was no obligation to wear a ball dress or suit.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the sound of the year.
About 180 guests are expected, which - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply kick in in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres’ tenure, the PM’s employees have celebrated every year in this way.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on January 20, this time the Christmas celebration of the Ministry falls off.
One hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short address from the minister and end with a restrained chatter.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for an indefinite strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest meeting is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - work begins.
It is expected that there will be a strike-related, significant traffic jams, since the railway traffic will be almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be jointly announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee will also be established, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will stop working indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will not be until later in the evening, or even at midnight, to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will have to be expected to cause significant traffic disruptions: the railway workers will stop their work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies will be silent.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the league website on an ongoing basis.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary lay-off.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railways M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Union of Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are travelling by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV is on strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy are putting down work for four hours, and the teachers’ union, for example, the Democratic Teachers’ Union has called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes alternately throughout the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft on health insurance reform and submit a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will become due next year.
Claim number three is that access to the early retirement system will be made available to eligible occupational groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the sidelines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
Among other things, the Institute’s “Risk Assessment Report” states that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the “intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term”.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007 several organizations, called "national self-defense associations" were founded.
"It is common for these groups to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly boast of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophic protection, state defense, law enforcement), citing the incompetence of the police, the army, the state itself," he said.
And further: All this is done according to that method, which tries to disguise various political aspirations, based on the political and party animosity of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not only used to circumvent legal obstacles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region," he said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard stood the Roma mass exodus, which took place in a neighborhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as the occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was "national protection".
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, a veritable "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have launched a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and should risk-changing trends be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated precisely by law, so that the practice of rescheduling working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
Even in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Unemployed days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the last day alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August the foundation of the state is celebrated, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “working day shift” has proven successful in cases where we would work just one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before that, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, for many years the Minister of Labour has set out in his own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employers, public employees and civil servants alike.
Exceptions are only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
This year, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life in this country remains formally standing, since most people take time off for the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or the holiday specifically cancelled for this purpose.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redundancies on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned on its head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so Friday, May 2 can be a day of rest.
The second rearrangement is related to the holiday on October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work in advance on Friday, October 24.
The end of the year, however, will be marked by the holidays, after everything has been lying and standing since December 24, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Disturbing Little Things to annoy Working Colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life in the workplace.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, for other annoying situations consciously.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to point out that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it right again by perhaps calling the marketing department and humbly admitting that you had forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it is done with an apology.
Before getting caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how you can really prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more nerve-wracking than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking, one should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, do not put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there, if you need it urgently.
Talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a trachea that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
You should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the privacy of colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than aligning with those who are not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
When you call in the office to report sick, citing painful headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, unremitting achievements, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
Don’t play with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to put it in the office the next day, or that something could get in the way, so you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
summaries, jokes, phone calls
You are in the depths of your work, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud whims of your colleagues?
Unintentionally listening to a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard better?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you carry across their heads), trampling, constant snarling or tingling.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deep in one task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not ready on time, you have to forget to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness in others!
If possible, do not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes, and apologize if others have been affected by them!
The question of how to correct the mistake again, or catch up with the missed one, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and slippers: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then one should dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too slutty - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio, a strange melody sounds: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with high-quality electropop.
But now you even see the jam differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is "in" again with his guitar gig, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in Pécs, even playing in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a tavern can't stand two pipes - started to walk his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k).
The band, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider public when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was voted almost the only marketable trend setter in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they also like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression originates from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was still travelling with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the - the zeitgeist and the trends - louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris.
A song from the album even made it into a radio hit – Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who has been broadcasting pop music since recently from early to late, has successively put the earworm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the help of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and unspeakable, but it can also only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial music.
Even a good pop number can be created from an honest motive.
The willingness of the listener to listen also works according to this principle, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
E.g. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them, much more attentively, because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more of our concerts are coming.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but these in turn exist only in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go our own way, apart from the fact that we try to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves as team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
E.g. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then serve as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to assemble the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then aptly named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls design it?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came about almost immediately and horrifyingly spontaneously.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it has already needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo part (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have a role of their own, they sing perfectly together and aren’t louder than the music, so their singing isn’t just accompanied by the music.
They were also at the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they were behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to let them access solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where is on the way, we simply allow ourselves to be lifted up by these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work, in fact, none at all, there have been rather more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything came together, as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes constantly with the concerts and even now, when I have the album "loslessen".
Currently, it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Unsubstantiated fraud
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It came to almost five billion euros for him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, moreover, certainly not incapacitated.
In contrast to all the major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's rather weak mentally," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
But according to Kerviel’s statements, published by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who had made 1.6 billion euros in profits with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits, and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits to falsifying documents so they wouldn’t get to him.
He even managed to keep his bosses in the dark, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually becoming interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
“I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"I knew in my first conversation in 2005 that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his arrival, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he made a lot of money by betting half a billion euros on price losses of this title during the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I made money, I closed my eyes.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, came the big blow.
In a single day, he lost a billion dollars.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspected of taking a vacation.
“I only took four days off last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which could bring the Czech Republic to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kroner from the "Company and Innovation" program.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the expansion of traffic.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative businesses.
The companies will thus win funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new accession countries in the acquisition of money from EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for ex-presidents
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for $100 million in financial fraud (nearly $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the head of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n is allowed to serve his sentence at home or if he has to go to prison.
A court ruled four years ago that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly moved government money into accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were in fact owned by his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not therefore afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law in all tranquility.
This is somewhat of a paradox.
Everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, and that is why they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high share of expenditures that are legally binding, not only on pensions, but also on social spending, which the “silent” coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the municipal budget deficit.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, taxes, and bank loans, issued additional sources of investment, often recklessly issuing bonds, through which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the massive sale of shares in the energy and other utility grids that they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
This source is now obsolete.
Insofar as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years now, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is proud of all the time.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments to put the public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have far more rationally managed than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributable to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been superfluously inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even if it has managed to wipe out some of the senseless populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then virtually every policy in this country ends, and, no matter who is in power, nothing will be pure to him.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then ruling politicians will become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the suppression of normal spending by compulsory spending.
The planned deficit of 70 billion kroner for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was only the case.
If we do not want to make it really happen that ruling politicians become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, to rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow the gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion at auction, with another 24 making it loose for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of each state have agreed on such a coordinated approach to fend off or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the greatest difficulties facing the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his clients.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-performing loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more to be lost.
“The central banks must have been really afraid of what could happen if they decided to do it,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession, potentially impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to lower the LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for interbank lending, after failing to do so.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is believed to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN’s upcoming international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he explained that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a fireworks display that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed at the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him, and that this is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book will appear in German translation, because "I often meet cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude in an unbiased way.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but he believes he has sufficient qualifications to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, able to understand and judge professional treatises, had experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that for global warming there is no consensus among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to avoid climate change are overblown.
Moreover, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly declared that he is not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield.”
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will enter the streets without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their driver’s license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of tickets, the capital’s offices are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration processes about 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The exhibition of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and start driving without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January onwards.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also issue a warning in case of violation.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the one from the church can get imposed a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to administer mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, but nobody threatened a thousand-crown penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, including a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive should get their driver’s license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him by registered letter there.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driver’s licenses from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having done common cause with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided by the Supreme Court of Prague in a legally binding judgment, which reduced their sentence by one or two years, respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s ruling, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is first faced with the first-instance judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
Moreover, he cannot be condemned.
A district court convicted 19 people in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, and the Supreme Court today ruled on the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants denied the charge from the beginning on the grounds that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, gave information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gangs to escape from prosecution.
The band left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the loot.
The charges relate to crimes committed by the gangs between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also because of official presumption and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns due to their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this case, courts found Berdych and a number of others legally guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych’s district have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children's rights: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation of 12 million crowns from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore disagrees with the Velebas proposal entirely.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high by many times," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that created the opposite side.
We will see if it has any value at all.
However, we insist that this should be for all in the hundreds of thousands of people," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablonov wanted one million crowns for each month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men performed better in the stress situation, even though they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablonov.
At the end of October, the mayor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina district handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred due to the failure of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they need to access a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can request help from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachia".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not take part in the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka parasitic," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the hearing.
All presented themselves in the words "Walachian Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Funding and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to parasitize our work,” he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
But this was not at the time connected with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From an originally fun action crystallized a business and an entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the foundation of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to its owners when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial purposes.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who had devoted themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of today's disbanded parties lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, the disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nimmerlein's Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> became Queen Mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring about Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>’s prepared contest for the throne and a half-princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal procession in Walachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up quietly," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advances disappear
To tell you the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combo called SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the insufficient headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the van is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior design for a short time, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the careful middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side hold has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the space available, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the bodywork here.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of head freedom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the loading space.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding back window) as very well rechargeable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains behind by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading edge after folding the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that’s what a 1600-cubic-engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a patch, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car strikes once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head fairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and...
The total cost of the car is 531900 kroner.
That's a lot, but once you calculate the extra equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
It is only up to you to decide which brand to choose.
Integrating Slovak students into British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of the local school system.
To date, the integration of Eastern Europeans has encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where disputes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Arguments, bullying, and bullying among students have been passed on to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks against the man and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush noise and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students told The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cited cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools, according to the report.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you choose only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and bewitching cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an excessive extent.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during prohibition) was liked and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, across the broad boulevards were cars that were among the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
Cocktails can be mixed at the bar at Hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars of the fifties still drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported schigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and moist air.
While Havana, especially its oldest part, may have come down heavily, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being cleaned up, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only in Havana, new hotels have been created, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have been in the museum for a long time.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not exclude the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don’t have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains only to mention that there is a museum in the already mentioned estate of Hemingways, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, protrude steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which even weathered rock areas are covered with dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in the last four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that there was no road connecting the area with the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This isolation helped to keep it unattended.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in eastern Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site thanks to its unspoiled nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after the voyages of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current hotel El Castillo, there are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion, to which the descendants of slaves confess, you could write many pages about all this.
But, as they say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should come up with a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas; in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Defense Minister Robert Gates, is calling on NATO units to increase activity, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development assistance.
“In Afghanistan, there is a noticeable progress, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start their own economic and security development,” said British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We’re going to have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop said the same.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week called the German soldiers faulpelze.
"Afghan nitwits unmasked: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild newspaper went on the counterattack and printed an image of a British unit in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt to rise to one trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a national debt of 84,000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on the state debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
“Until now, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told the server iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “To exceed one trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it were to show that the situation is changing on the political stage, and politicians should be prepared to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he said.
Debts are growing
State debt comes from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds of the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The state’s foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
“Over the year, total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly recorded in the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of public debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned for this year to raise 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, these are maximum planned funds for the consolidation agency in the amount of 13.3 billion kronor, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of sovereign debt for 43 billion and rates for bonds with the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be beaten.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this affair begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class entdy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
After all, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all, a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knows her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her closer to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it is only a mistake to blame her.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Keep in mind that the name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given surname in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the prophet (he is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last meeting in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not come to an agreement on the status, said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to maintaining peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiation session since the Troika received an order from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that final date.
Russia has been and remains a proponent of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Regrettably, no agreement could be reached, President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the hotel in Baden, where these last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade for the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, warning the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly forging a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 90s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian ally holds a veto.
Kosovo's parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end the way they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that Kosovo's parliament would have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would proceed in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush calls for agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which met Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the peace roadmap they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty that would clarify all open issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This term encompasses the three serious problems that have been the main focus of Israeli-Palestinian disputes: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the 1948 conflict in what is now the State of Israel.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor for his part, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would make every effort to ensure that they could be concluded before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which will exist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received assurances from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has pioneered a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories that had been occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face off.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car on Rue Louise-Michel drove towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He did not have a bet, but was on a streak, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a spokesman for the police explained.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without approval, therefore not released for public road traffic (see below), came, driven by two young people without a helmet, approached at a very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it disregarded its right-hand drive, a police officer explained.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (bolted fender, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she has entrusted to the IGPN an investigation into the "facts of involuntary manslaughter and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main district directorate for public safety of Vald.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excludes the responsibility of the police officers in the investigation of the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, have confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this small power bike has reached their left side relatively quickly .
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked into each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were exhumed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel a rumor quickly made the round, according to which the police had left the accident site very quickly, and this without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are necessary, and in which one must proceed very carefully .
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who was lagging behind.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, it seems, due to the certainty that the persons present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers of colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken in the car.
Still according to this witness statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police officers left.
They have also applied heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed in turn.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police put down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades used by the security forces there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court’s lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have been held in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement received support from the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal coalition of religious parties, whose president urged the population to send flowers to judges who had spoken out against the state of emergency, and to those who had sworn an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to re-elect President Musharraf in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News declared.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to give the supreme command over the army and become a civilian president has been suspended since the state of emergency was called, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was given a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unplanned births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unplanned births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-tonne module for generating electricity via solar collectors, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew decided to restructure the solar panels of the module, the span of which is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a control walk and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the space shuttle’s 30-meter-long remote-controlled arm, which had been attached to the station, to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old learned doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and attached some kind of rail to the damaged area.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar collectors, which generate several hundred volts, had been designed and built by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the collector to fully unfold before counting down his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery, expected to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the A400M’s debris, EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the A400M engine's slow-moving engine development, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, EADS’ business performance fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
The A400M was originally planned to be delivered to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday, the counting of the ballots will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything see through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of meddling – his favorite topic during the election campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,” he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they left.
It depicts an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Yeltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized after five centuries after Europe; the famous communal spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again linked to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians freely renounce the personal responsibility that they have for a short time after the disintegration of the USSR.
What else to think about for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all strata of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often tantamount to chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What to think about for a long time?
Those in power aren’t so bad, why are they replacing them?
A hard memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states responsible for its administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to carry out investigations, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU’s foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe will be the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India, the European Commissioner continued, said the European Commission’s Manuel Manelh. The Asian and European bartenders are still trading their goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, this week’s Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission’s delegation in New Delhi, told the European Commission.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
To mitigate the fears that conditions in the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty on how to organize their liquidity positions during this period, the bank intends to provide a significant portion of its savings during the maintenance phase, which begins on December 6th.
The bank further explains that this way on December 6th at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the property tax rate and only until January 10th.
This appears to be the first time that the BoE is putting liquidity into circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the day-to-day interest rates on interbank loans with their base rate.
The day-to-day interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has fluctuated to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to fines that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist purchasing power bill, which amounted to a rejection of the text.
The text, created in the framework of a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures that had been adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of them 50% for the employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP floating, for a transport check or for the restriction of rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent word exchanges between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television post on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances, which had been examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
“It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world’s most prestigious festivals.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side-by-side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival to life in Grand Park Chicago after it joined the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events each earned $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on the urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban one in the American way.”
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the Mayor, is taking the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who won the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes it.
These lock-in attempts are among the delegated tasks.
A politically "holy mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is denouncing "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the Festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the local cinema is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market heading for a year-end rally? Disagreements among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange usually accompanies a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These invest mainly in pension funds, which are affected by the upward trend.
Therefore, in the opinion of these experts, the stock exchange will have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we can not yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US central bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of the increase in the rate of inflation.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
In the opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund made every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently; especially due to the end-year rally already in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution, taking place.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are on an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will turn out to be positive.
In the selection of the values that should drive the Ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year it is the big values that are on the line.
Among the value-winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a recovery course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, according to the expert.
Regarding the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, in the last half of the year the periodic consumption will determine the market happening.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines in exchange rates.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-of-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also present a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, since Popular as the first banking group represents the leap, to extend the opening hours of its stores on weekdays to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a final decision.
The bank’s ongoing negotiations with the unions appear to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all stores will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And this is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the procuring customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is connected with a new room design of the stores, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased staffing, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
A further 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit, specialise in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don’t want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time, surpassing its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
The CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The channel led by him had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: That’s exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a gain of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a loss of a total of 40.5% since January, so its market value is at 2,193.46 million to half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, rises; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that these are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still arises, to what extent we can actually act on stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its plan to become the first TV channel to generate more than 1,000 million gross advertising revenue this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
Should the project be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business could only have increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better performance is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to maintain to date: In 2006, the company, led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, generated a 100 percent dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, could still vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always indicated much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecuritys: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (holding) as a result of the multiple incentives and the thriving market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in the face of similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting that ended its session today with the Congressional resolution in the Senate on the supplementary/amendment requests associated with the project, the government published the provisions that emerge from the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senators, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regime that ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities, in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising financial markets, MIFID, which re-establishes the securities services regime, is pursuing improvements in investor protection, increasing the Spanish Securities Commission’s (CNMV) control claim, and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows financial advice to be offered to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies that join the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of securities trading and the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic actors.
The law obliges investment companies to register the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks in the market and all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently made further changes, with the decision that the titled bond must now be considered a complex financial asset for the investor due to its high degree of risk, having been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the work of qualified economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation was adopted, which restricted the work reserved for economic scientists.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can simultaneously offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the extraction of customers to several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator, which is used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union, provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which by publishing the data seek a comparison of location and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) cautioned that the indicator identified at an early stage should only serve as a benchmark and therefore should not be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the GDP in November was a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation differential to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also said there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a big increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion in revenue over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At the time, the bank’s assets totalled a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly in the space of two and a half months due to the loss of customers’ trust and even despite the government’s one hundred percent guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decline.
Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, needs to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will consist of the investments of the next three years, to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its remarkable advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to funnel <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (equivalent to about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to take it out of insolvency.
Mayor of Totana Arrested for Suspected Participation in Urban Corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), part of the municipality of Murcia, this morning on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo last May represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wiretap of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged, MP Juan Morales was arrested on leaving the residence of his client due to important documents of burden, which are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information about the alleged order payments Morales reported to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban construction contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an electoral victory, to the Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, will assume the office of Congress President.
José Blanco, secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party’s headquarters today.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, since it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would apparently run for the party as president of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as Congress president, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer run in the next general election, ending his career in public policy, and instead be active in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had been continuously pushing for his return to political action.
In addition, he pointed out that, as with the appointment of the vice president of the economy, the party did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of congress president in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect rather than insult or shouting, so as to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place where one cannot speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work and indicated that he did not want to create the appearance of having already taken over the office, since otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to merciless criticism by both climate change skeptics and those who focus on a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must demonstrate a strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a state of emergency regarding the action or non-action of his government, which has decisively contributed to Spain being at the top of the list of countries within the EU that have least complied with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for failing to meet the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to Spanish citizens the measures he has planned against climate change without hesitation.
What companies will be affected, what behaviour of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what economic consequences will result from this.
More precisely, who must sacrifice and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, it has and will not have such explanations in the future.
It’s because it’s about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can actually be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE appeared to Zapatero strategically so dangerous that he saw himself forced to take back the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise suitable for election campaigns does not have to speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we may only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in an urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-based town of Totana, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, as well as the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel entrepreneur, on suspicion of urban construction violations, it was said today from investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is located to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction manager Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are in connection with the arrests that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped building land for urban construction projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria. This should be built on the property during the period of the local administration.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation procedure, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six detainees were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, it is also being investigated against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of Nuaria and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against Urban Crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies that were directly related to those found in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia-based village, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt, with the aim of implementing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo operates the car parks of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the sale of construction equipment, and the promotion,
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will deviate from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of another name with corresponding competencies.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, incidentally, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the position of the note published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; incidentally, on the day of its publication, the Blackburth.
The content of the subject Philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an Abiturian, who in his messages quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching should be removed from the undergraduate curricula for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which will be subject to six months in prison.
However, if you again rob a music store worth less than 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft will be considered a criminal offence, but the penalty will be less than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a racket than it is to participate in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebel conflict carries a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyrighted films, the authorization of which has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should be right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite nicely.

My doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Life&Brain Brain Research Center in Bonn, activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct in their response and therefore received the same salary; but when one of them received twice as much, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I’m not quite sure if it actually takes that much scientific effort to come to such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inexorably following the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years and is based in the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are on the list of the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her attempt to conceal these escaped crimes.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance policy is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is entered into in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to present the corresponding severance amount in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance consisting of several factors, including age, gender, date of creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accident, higher contribution payments become due.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married people, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single people.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurance companies must take into account a whole series of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance, in order to be able to make not only a performance-, but also a price-oriented choice.
When choosing a low-cost insurance policy, those under the age of 25 face numerous obstacles, such as low driving practice and a young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Cautious drivers can choose a full-face helmet with a deductible, so that the benefits of a full-face helmet insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer has to pay a part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount will be determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, chief representative of Spain at First Europe, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to lower your insurance costs, so your credit score increases by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, which is due to the fact that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for a full-cash insurance with self-insurance.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the fear of the novice has been removed.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who does not have children, it is advisable to take out full-cash insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person concerned also allows.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with a deductible (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, it is recommended to take out an extended insurance, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is a good idea to take out full insurance with a deductible (with an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only works with a sufficiently high credit score.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs, which require that a thorough selection be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow are hoping to reach the semi-finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will compete in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the Champions League pre-season ends, with the Italians needing the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow need another one with nine points to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will compete for the first time in the 13th semi-final for the entry to the final, which will take place on the 16th.
This group will be finished ahead of all the others and the tie at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow know that in the event of a victory they would be a group star and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team could have had enough of a loss to qualify for the knockout stage of FC Shakhtar, but he shouldn't have relied too heavily on such circumstances, as the Ukrainians are entitled to nine points equal; they lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
So, the Milanese will try to miss the Scots in the evening. Those, in turn, hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the same round by a goal from Kaka in the post-game time (1-0) and by a zero to zero indecision on the way.
While FC Shakhtar waits for the Rossoneri’s victory, the team will have to focus on their own game as both reaching the 18th final and his UEFA membership depend on his victory and Celtic Glasgow’s defeat.
Despite its low standing and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could take third place by a win and thus play at UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls performed in Vancouver, Canada, before the eyes of 20,000 spectators for their first tour since the band's break-up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood in front of them is united.
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video was shown about the history of the band, which had caused fury at the end of the nineties.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which had been given to them by Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd of fans who set the GM Palace on fire, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star has not once seen our wardrobe, and that is why I am already very excited about what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later drew the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought why not, so I’m glad I made that decision,” Chisholm said of the breakup of the band she had started nine years ago.
The singer also made it known that the disputes were eliminated and now everyone likes each other very much again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
First, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines machine, according to a report on CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will next perform in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New fears over natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish Public Health Service needs to improve controls on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation by Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service has no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly performed on a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out pre-employment checks on foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the agency does not have the jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, these were not routinely performed," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their pre-employment screening guidelines to a high degree, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that NHS Scotland's current pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards would have problems identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian had been predominantly complied with.
This includes passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its pre-employment screening policies and guidelines for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern of mine to carry out this work in the face of the Glasgow Airport terrorist attack."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the report’s recommendations and ensure that best practices are reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment screenings for all employees – including those from abroad – which are scheduled to be released next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Award Ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded Best Actress for Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing British film to the world.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on which the soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for just 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has brought two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary film.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s thriller Easter Promises in London.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation to play hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of person, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as clerics and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid-fire force to protect facilities following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who immigrated to the country illegally.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clerics and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join Al Qaeda militias in Iraq who want to fight the allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen as heretical by hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on orbit show that the planet is even more like a distant twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is devoid of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the plants for a year, provide a sobering glimpse into how Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.”
“Our new data will allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he doesn’t think a presidential candidate is worthy of being questioned by a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately declared himself ready to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, Nov. 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is heading into next year’s election.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate, who selected YouTube clips to show the prospective candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a ballot when they heard things they liked: The broadcaster noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Romney, who has pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of having been lenient about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly vocal in questioning whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has a serious chance at being nominated, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have squandered on the immigration slug earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were brought to the fore.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that while the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now against all expectations in first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was asked if Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent fundraising successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two are shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly flattering.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politicians paid Parisian hotel bills, no extra-marital toes have been squandered.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has been hiding donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the rival Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had evaded the demand for an election, in a foolish way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-witted chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-feared Brown from Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative pfusheries.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest at cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and her former fulfillment manager) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading for retirement.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they find it impossible to govern.
Neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new troupe takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even have to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is starting to run away; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax filings, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misdeeds — as in the long “money for titles” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks
The offenses are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been completely scammed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new gesture of political donations is a good example.
The garboesque of Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The anti-anonymity laws for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s deal but didn’t know it was illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial driver, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his inauguration in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grabbing a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full, from a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be drawn from them" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
That would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unquestionable righteousness and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
Is the credit crisis affecting the U.S. credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that the back fins swirl excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is crumbling, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of under-funded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both withdrawals and rescheduling rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are ineligible or more than 30 days too late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee levy out of its U.S. consumer finance, in part because of the weakness of credit card holders.
However, it is too early to panic.
Losses and sneezes are still low.
According to Moody’s, the third-quarter seed rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
An amendment to the U.S. Private Insolvency Laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large portion of kedit card losses; the number of filings (and thus tuition fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers worsen or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that 2007 spending will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when real estate is worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important under repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid reassessment of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit crunch push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimer future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their pleas in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven cases of fraud involving telecommunications means for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the UK in the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against her in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to hatch a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepresented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others declined about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's lawsuit.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was on the loose due to a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, broke down in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer disguise billion-dollar debt or make debilitating ventures appear profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the brand Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
“It accommodates up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day orgy of on-going consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly minted Russians in everything from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-lined car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously aimed a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
“This is a nice car, but it’s small compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its heyday.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in droves where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflights of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the world’s most visible free-floating money-changers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweller.
For the first time, she attended the fair together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well-groomed and men are all worth a fortune.”
As they walk through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be primarily aimed at the New Reichs, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for several hours to visit a decent warehouse, the unassuming Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick Eiskrem, custom-made appliard tables and teddy bears.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' envoys, or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the glaring orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble linked chain-arm tires for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-pack.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconia, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Mr Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian said, the phrase “Russian millionaires” would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells modeled after the British, which were crammed with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaires’ fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the piles of money, taking mobile phone photos as they leaned back in the middle of the spare wealth, getting pinched by friends, or just plugging in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Suspected operation in New Jersey death
It was the day before the harvest Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod stopped two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical bodyguard approaching," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman, Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help unravel a mysterious death that has sent grief through the top of the Newark police force.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and persistent,” Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” said Ms. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh declined to say whether Ms. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a dappled rose bush stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to a rise in global equity markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by further lowering interest rates were bolstered by reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the No. 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said the policy had to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm troubled markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October."
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were picked up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street, in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK default values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure in the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds of the European Central Bank, granted to the European Commercial Banks, was granted to a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed more capital into the money markets in London rose as credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” lending rates between UK banks rise by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous rise.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to beat England number 6 in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, on call at least under this special title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide to do so, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually not even filling in part-time applications for national electoral offices.
Whoever does not get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets out of the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck rather than ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgements are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink?
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances are they do too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time if he can take a wicket and a batsman must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better off last season than, for example, when James Anderson was apparently going to play in the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind is converging into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of perspective.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to solidify at the time, who made the breakthrough into a significant Test cricketer and who, although scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still undervalued.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion during today’s web session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay speaks, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years seven years younger, and an excellent record against turned balls.
But Shah made just ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test in Lord, his home run as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seemed to have taken the swing out of his blow in the Bombay still open.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently knocked over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, “Did you see this?”.
Bopara is a much better field player, he congeals his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be doing well if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he is the one who will be playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to Shiite militias led by militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at present.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia had helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and stalemate in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister who asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the country’s sectarian death squads.
"We did well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflict will ensue.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarlanders push the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I declared to a non-Saarland that we are not French" - this slogan is self-described by the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is accordingly high at 15.6 percent.
But also the children of the Landeskinder brings the Saarland in above average numbers to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their education at a vocational school, with the Saarland being more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also significantly expanded.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
However, despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering science subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated several reforms at the general education schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last kita-year is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying as well.
Future comparative studies will only show whether students’ performance is improving in the long term.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of students at risk declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not grow as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And to the dismay of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez turns the clock
In Venezuela, the clock is ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will turn back the clock in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez becomes a joke.
According to a new law, the clocks will be set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US-hostile Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a geyser affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this just because of my dignity," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe "spitted Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez said on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chavez is in full swing.
A new mobile ringtone is causing a stir in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Ibero-America summit was annoyed by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist and had run over his mouth.
German threatens 2007 pay-minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are expected to face a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler-Stiftung, employees could actually expect to have less in the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to ask the Federal Government for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's twin.
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the devil’s twin on Earth, but she’s a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has made such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties no more probes specifically for the exploration of this planet were underway.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-tallest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is about the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it turns much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus barely resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonaceous rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President K<0xC3><0xB6>hler demands an end to the party's dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from within the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots as in France
Street battles with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots as in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from unleashing itself into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We have to make sure that social explosives are not built up in our country and discharged into violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he told the “New Press” in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the summit of integration to the Islam conference, this already shows the first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
At the same time, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, as there are in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were also set on fire in Toulouse.
The president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the crash in France, Kolat warned of "immediate effects".
The situation in Germany is not as dire as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 years of age is "above average".
In particular, more training places must be provided.
Kolat stressed, “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control takes place in the families".
Many youths with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, “But we still have to be careful.”
“You need to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and education quickly.”
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the day before, an outpouring of around 1,000 security forces has been a source of rest.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots overtook Toulouse.
The wreckage ignited in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to initial findings of the prosecutor’s office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor’s out-of-the-ordinary appearance documents that the coalition is at the end of its content – and that nothing more can be expected of her.
In which country does this Chancellor live?
After her uneasy appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was frenzied and content-poor, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
The accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an argly arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, only showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation applies.
There was neither a specific interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a lofty politician who flees into foreign policy and even remains there in the vicinity.
Climate protection example: She praises herself for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much impudence the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing is coming to people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautify the world.
But in Angela Wolke’s realm, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She has a few extras left for that.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child addition.
It takes Merkel three runs to get a semi-straight set out.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attacking Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard-hitting exchange - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is relieved already on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This counters with heavy accusations: “I would say his own house was a haven for illegals,” Giuliani counters, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
As the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-directed 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong reading from the Vietnam Veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called “waterboarding,” a method of interrogation that simulates drowning as torture.
However, the key themes of the campaign are now beyond Iraq War and torture debates, according to the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause flares up in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, pleading before the base and television audience that he was still a pro-abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into trouble when, in his opinion, he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloody military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with jurists weighed with him after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock are back
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies is playing music again: the three band members of Harmonia rehearsed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival, a shot from her big time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The roomed sensation then takes place in the form of three gentlemen seated at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is crowned in a white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is bent, focused on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the men themselves much.
The fact that the band Harmonia is re-musicing has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What you can reveal here: Targeted demands revealed that the name, although fluttered through the collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable, to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
In fact, what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more true in England and America than in one’s own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, the hall was filled with asking German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! in the laudatio, the surprise knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother would later sit on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old pal.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transformation in the stranger is the one.
The memory is already overloaded with harmony, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much lower potency than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as out-of-town communes.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still plagued as a nanny.
Rather in a sharp-edged artist's existence.
Apparently there was also a pennant of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them were harmonizing.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because so relaxed and humble the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice was not used solely for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother came at that time the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius a non-sectarian demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmony ever since.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is there, the Brit, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmony in the farmers' lounge.
The legend formation is used for projections of other black and white photos of wirr wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more by gluing microphones to the organ and to the drum to extract unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.

The choir of the house does not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, it is housed under sound clouds and whispered and sung in a beautiful place with the emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (Power Plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who calls here '68' is not quite wrong, and harmony cannot be brought out of it even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of the nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murdering Peace" two films deal with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts bet too much on action and excitement, or they are too moving.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help that either.
The good news first: while war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties recently, because too many cute-belanglose roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove one’s desire for attention.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted" (Why do movie titles today have to be always as long and confusing as driver's license agreements?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has his very best times long behind him, but who himself as a ruinous monument to his demise still has considerable remains of the one.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, together with the German production of Murderer’s Peace, which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb from Kosovo snipers, and one of them falls in love with them immediately.
Although it is worth welcoming that once here the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evils, the flat-screen film gets lost too quickly in baler and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal “the fox” could have become a new “Apocalypse Now” with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at a different time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can’t and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downtrodden cynic with heart, as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also tell him about a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunting Party" will finally go down the drain if the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in the time-lapse process what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have failed in five years: Catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to a just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a deeply human nature.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree on one thing only) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen foreheads, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil."
Movies like “The Hunting Party” have just such threshold heads, which, however, indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraq movies were Hollywood’s big flop.
It can be added: there has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always, if a star is running around on the crisis herds or minefields of the world, then something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler’s List.
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" which are now considered classics have by no means been celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps we know today where every mass murder comes home in real time on the same two screens, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs screenwriters of the recklessness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, “being or not being” or “The Great Dictator” have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcasticly distanced artist’s view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust criticises Olympic cancellation
The mayor’s departure from Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has come under heavy criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But Beust suggests realism in the assessment of the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project in the city has recently developed motivational forces as great as the Olympiadee.
"Without this goal, the momentum of sport policy would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it that "starts from a changed ray of time".
Mayor Ole von Beust made earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, which is expected to take place in early December.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have planned until 2028."
Yet the dream was not dreamed of for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to compete for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this point," HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There Beust called Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade “not a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only last week nominated Hamburg as an applicant city.
The SPD citizenship faction accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and has clamped down on housing construction," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Kleine Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU has unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had aroused great enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you connect the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of IKEA, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s work directory.
A large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there from the "Typ Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago has cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol's works of art from the year 1968 onwards, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which are the former museum director Pontus Hultén's works of art from 1995 onwards.
Prehistory is nestled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "brillo boxes" in New York City, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, exhibited hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes: these did not come from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not, however, on display at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time were authorized as original Andy Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" rightfully entered into the history of art and auctions.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that there were about a hundred wooden boxes produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three privately owned Swedish Brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press chip plates were first ground and lubricated, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressing chipboard with a paint roller without primer - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," Moderna Museum Director Lars Nittve states: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museum will copy the six classic boxes into its collection."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the “serious allegations” that are being raised in relation to the soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebel Soldiers in Manila to Surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up, holed up in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be held responsible for the bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiation to suddenly stand down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to be guarding him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the stately hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large-scale demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Her government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours of the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
An acquisition had previously been speculated.
Keep the option open to increase the share of Versatel even more.
With this step, we want to drive the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, there had already been speculations about a start-up, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-based network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1%.
The money house only considers the shares to be a third party, it said in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already participated with almost 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to take over competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a good ten percent stake in Freenet and make no use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies, however, remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is still difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connection customers.
The holdings of United Internet and Drillisch have so far held a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute another around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
