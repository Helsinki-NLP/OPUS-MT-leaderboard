The great return of the Czech smol<0xC3><0xA1>r is approaching.
Pavel French has been drafted to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-year-old Pilsen native will be on the alternator and soon he could get into the goal.
A former goaltender from Litvinov, Pilsen or Russia’s Chelyabinsk injured himself in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He alternated with Vegas in the middle of the game and has not played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred at the moment when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
“Paul French will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower-body injury,” the Denver unit said in early October.
His return to the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from the farm, where he captured four duels and showed his old form.
The AHL reported 94.5% of the cases.
The Pilsen hockey coach wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had problems with his hips in the last year and did not catch a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Franc<0xC3><0xAD>k" captured 36 matches, his success rate of operations is at the number 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille’s blush on Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which Camille helps to put on a robe on the race tracks.
It was reported on its website by the British news station BBC.
Wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they collaborate.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long khaki summer dresses, and Princess Charlotte is wearing them.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wears shorts and a shirt with a collar, just like Prince George and Prince Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, it is not clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photo intended as a Christmas wish on a straw package in front of a pile of wood in their country home in Norfolk County.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by the successor to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him at the Ascot race in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a robe on his face, helps Camille put on her robe in a color-matched light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the idea that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have promised Prague’s Slavia one million crowns for a league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about it with the fact that he got to the part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the top club Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k said that the red-whites did not allow any corruption.
The server has published a transcript of police interrogations, which include Slavia’s former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berbre and former sports director of the then second-tier Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from the officials of SK Slavia Praha was promised a million bribe for the win in the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board Slavia Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He has rejected any form of corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal conduct, we have not sought to influence the arbitrators in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard," Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
In the interviews, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players with dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The case of alleged influence of matches through referees was launched last year in mid-October by police intervention at several places including the Prague headquarters of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest-ranked player in the game is Berbr, who is no longer in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Rogoz, he was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle of a worse type (the gunners must come out of the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
Honitbu is right next to the city.
Nutrients climbed out of the river and did damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the bank of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but, of course, a fox came in a moment.
I let her figure out 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself, waving his head to all sides, so I called him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of the seat, there was a fuc.
I mean, and a good man's being a prusser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of many coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably see it in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, dear things, put your feet in a backpack and you should be fine.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch versus Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
Inside, the ventilators were significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for purchasing and distributing gowns, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day, the amounts per respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved in an economic way?
And why did others buy the railing?
Lenka Kabrhelov<0xC3><0xA1> talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I respect the soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by the memories of the <0xC4><0x8C>SLA that the older generations have suffered), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the obligatory war.
We don’t even have large warehouses of equipment that can handle training, we don’t actually have modern technology for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the capabilities of the forwarders will quickly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where someone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-exercise someone.
And finally, backers/territorial defense are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrillas go to lead, and it is also a stated necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will be conducted only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrillas will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for it.
We don’t have any individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had one.
Then you're in a situation where you're looking at a guy who hasn't hit an empty gate in two minutes, he's going to attack himself between two or even three Swiss, and you're like, "What do you think's going to happen now?"
Well, of course he's being recruited as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "beating the defender" is so terrible that I caught myself that I am honestly surprised to see that our attacker has managed to overtake one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the next few weeks.
According to statistical models, the outbreak in hospitals will last for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: a variant of the omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, as far as vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by previous shedding of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports success even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first to domestic patients will receive molnupiravir from Merck.
The company ended up in the first band because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often forgotten that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying "how our teeth have grown".
You'll do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don’t.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
Afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means a loss of work and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in surveys, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmoura both account for over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where what is, so all the hair objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of the Hills and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the sssr did not want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory either because of the safety or the speed of deployment of warheads because of the western position.
In these underground shelters (in each maple there are two), only the heads and not the entire rockets were kept, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this head and mounted it on some load-bearing equipment.
In addition to the museum map, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate of Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite okay, he made good jokes, he often showed up too much, but he was such a mascot of ours.
Everyone had fun with him, he often walked and wanted to explain something, he was missing little, he walked regularly, he played sports with us, he didn’t steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to nature schools, did various monkey shops, but he was fine, maybe never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies joined the same class, other classes.
In short, they beat up the teacher, often dealt with something there by the police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to advertise (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I’ve often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn’t try to drag me down on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called a month ago that he had already rewritten it on himself.
I say to myself that I’m not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they belong in a decent society (work, work, women don’t fight, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he extends his hand, he rents out apartments and houses, he has a mess around him, he makes problems... so it doesn't matter what color he has, but I'm going to mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least in English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatik
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health rescuers.
The accident was probably blamed on the driver who drove the girl.
The 18-year-old Peugeot driver probably drove in the direction from the village of <0xC5><0xBD><0xC3><0xAD>chovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons that have not yet been determined, headed in the opposite direction in the corner.
After a collision with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokesman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Schwarz described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were a lot of injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in stable condition was transported by air to the Czechoslovak hospital, said rescuer Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide information about them
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector adds.
Since October, the order of small consignments has been slightly overpriced, new VAT has to be added and the post office has to hand over the data to the customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail saying that the customs officers are waiting for the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT has not already been included in the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount per consignment and per transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier must also be credited with the total amount.
But according to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two tear-off boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a five-minute question, Neuheisl says.
However, not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of incoming shipments from abroad decreased from 60,000 to 15,000 per day at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data they needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, Czech Post spokesman Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vit<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
The solution to inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to continue its growth.
What do you think should be done to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction of VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it goes?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
This year they added me 2% in gross, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from businesses that I run while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only six months?
This just doesn’t bother me, as the court can only send such an animal to jail for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, this will negatively affect her/his sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that the victim of rape never has to recover from it either.
Doesn't this deter potential future reports of rape of victims?
The man from the grave "smeared" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Tomb reluctantly helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to himself.
He went about it, though.
He first approached the passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged “stolen” told them that he had invented everything for the guards to arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a notification with the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
This is why the case is being handled by the CPA.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally repressed for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague from the United States :-)
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's pretty much a question of whether a rational person can really believe something without any evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
Here I cannot agree with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world, if I am not mistaken, of about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods do you choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will unfailingly punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the tithe, there is no other god but Yahweh.
Would it not then be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk being wrongly chosen out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god whom I have not yet met will send me to hell or some other place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months on one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If a person behaves well, he can get a professional offer.
For all the ACR components, something like this would be appropriate.
This could be done in collaboration with the University of Defence.
We can speak like this: the cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly declining, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of interlocking, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is constantly going on, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Such a merger should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that there will never be another Russian, German or even Mongolian invader here.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us in case of a disaster.
Well, have a good time, gentlemen.
One election in the U.S. is enough to cut their budget and the whole NATO is going to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves to be able to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence for a long time is the armed army and the population that can control the military technology of their time.
And today he can pilot the remote-controlled means of every teenager, so what could not.
We don't need border fortifications, that's fucked up today, but a busy teenager behind the wheel of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unpack gifts under a Christmas tree and suddenly you’re home wrapped in boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of shops was created to welcome your used boxes.
And not just for Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulations.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, since the packaging carton has risen by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically-minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such shop is also TIERRA VERDE, manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are carried to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vek near Brno by individuals who collect at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have regular orders of cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the receipt points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the household, where to hand over past medicines, tires, spent electricity, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
“It gradually increases the number of collecting yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kub<0xC3><0xA1>sek, one of the authors of the application.
Rather, I find it wrong that nowadays, the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but above all, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – before the weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they cannot be reached in half a year.
The French people like it, and so do the voters.
Macron’s supporters of the right-left split agree on a few things, but in Europe they do.
And in France, there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready for such a work of historians to create conditions.
A number of commentators were quick to criticise Macron for his pro-European propaganda and his rewriting of history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French President <0xC3><0x89>ric Zemmour is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea for a history textbook seriously and not look at what’s going on in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries are densely taught history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in that battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won an award for the director and for the best actress Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held on the first steps of the viewer's ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being drugged" For a few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the flu, it was worse.
I don't have the flu.
(Only personal experience. I do not claim that everyone has that)

Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unusual poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer <0xC5><0xA0>est<0xC3><0xA1>k tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be only a sought-after illusion.
A bohemian and a comparatist brings the tale of the Red Carnation to the backdrop of the current village.
Its brutalization surpasses the popular version and escalates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the way back to the instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his last novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to listening to.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains begin to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains begin to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, where RegioJet begins to operate instead of Czech routes.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or even slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Ticket sales began in the autumn of this year.
The Czech railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, out of which 478 long-distance trains will operate on an average daily basis.
The trains run approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national routes under the new timetable, the routes will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains will be sent to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally raise fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry on the line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k – Nymburk – Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
After success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace the Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 routes on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>r nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, despite the planned exclusive work, the carrier tried to preserve the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged on some regional routes.
Passengers are waiting for changes, for example, in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipska, where trains from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav via <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Rumburk will be operated by Trilex trains of the German company Die L<0xC3><0xA4>nderbahn instead of the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform fare on the railway for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the look of the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to fight, they were dying.
In my life I have not heard teaching from the point of view of the slavery party or from that time, no one is defending this, just condemning.
No one will ever tell you in school that blacks often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they will tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in northern and southern schools.
I have not encountered anyone intentionally silencing the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (perhaps in Japan the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s point of view, without understanding it.
History doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings, it’s just what they are, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it again.
By the way, when we are with those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it today.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn’t compare this with the Russians, they deliberately ignore some facts, they lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view on them doesn’t exist (there was also a video on YT from the TV, where there was someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What struck me at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found that it was horrifying at some universities, those students were quite radicalized, and those schools supported them in how many times.
And if I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has already achieved what it had long ago and it is no longer the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At present, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as do other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to opposition even in quite reasonable things.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in the end, I also did not meet with the fact that someone would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I've seen a lot of bad weather, but it's been two-way. :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, I have interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some cocoon about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin, as it was before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – A flame set in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts for him due to the coronavirus pandemic but this time they did not go to Vienna, in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal – B<0xC5><0x99>eclav.
He was arrested at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the department every year, I look forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, Scout Am<0xC3><0xA1>lie Bud<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually for him, the scouts go by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrlem.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be handled by scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, who will travel on selected speedboats and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flames in the Czech Republic and where the railways do not lead.
Also this year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
This is going on the same way as last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, to wear the robes, to try to observe the intervals, to be as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way as to be as safe as possible, the spokesperson of the event of the Bethlehem light Hrza described.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believer a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Scouts have been concerned about its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is attended by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of non-profit and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don’t have an economic education, so I don’t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don’t think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education use the money properly, but I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it destroys the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million signboards "xy financed / co-financed by xy project" on the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the acceleration of development when this company both holds and takes orders / employees to companies that after its demise could grow and be more productive
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age will get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads do not move with me, but then I get the impression that they also influenced me - it is already so erased that one does not always prevent it.
That is why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who are currently trying to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the internet.
I have a feeling this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion which I’ll claim is critical thinking.”
“I don’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
TV has lost the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of which have two hundred this year
Los Angeles – Cinema, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen behind the trend of Christmas movies, and this year it will present a record more than two hundred to its viewers at the premiere.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been gaining an audience’s attention and significantly increasing its follow-up, which is why these films are becoming more and more popular.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, meanwhile, included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will be a lot more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, especially fairy tales are associated with this period, pictures at home, Love in the sky or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946 are popular all over the world.
However, the real boom in Christmas pictures did not start until 2009, when the special film series came with the American cable television station Hallmark, the BBC server reminded.
Her adventure project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films at the time and was a huge success.
This year, this station began to tune its audience for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, the competition station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the program, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
“In this magical period, it doesn’t matter that much about the story, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of a book on Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“For viewers, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours amid all the holiday madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding arises, which, of course, is resolved successfully and the two kiss.
That’s how it’s all over the place, and as long as all the movies look the same and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for COVID-19, will not interfere in the final race of F1.
The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1 will be won by only nineteen riders.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for Covid-19 and will not interfere in the last race of the season.
Stop Haas so he only sends one formula on the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he came out in qualifying.
The Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable, however, will not be involved in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last corner, the first Max Verstappen to face Lewis Hamilton in a direct title battle.
Mazepin is relatively healthy, according to the Haas stable, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
Now he is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all parties involved," said its representatives for formula1.com.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, and he can't.
Any substitute would have to complete a qualification or drive in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not affected by COVID-19.
Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen had COVID-19 at the start of the season, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It’s a bit like portable jewelry, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, the sweaters were never worn very much at home,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over the course of six months.
Silk was purchased in Italy, 24 carat gold threads in France, and 2,000 decorative crystals were delivered by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And it's got another hook.
"I'm completely out of stock, I have to sell my sweater as soon as possible," Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the help of NATO states, in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already active in the Polish territory.

Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently we have reported further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov High School is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the region this week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that there were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, two eleven-year-old students of Adamov University.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms.
No one with suspicion of Omicron traveled abroad
None of them had traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who was abroad.

California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas to ban abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state through a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law following the detection of an embryo's heart rate.
People would then be entitled to compensation in lawsuits against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement came in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday that the Texas abortion ban remained in effect, albeit against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that set the right to abortion flatly across the U.S. around the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue that results from the innovative construction of the measures.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to bring him to justice.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s (Friday’s) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be upheld and largely supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” the governor said.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use that power to protect human lives,” Newsom continued.
He said he had instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the justice minister, to work on measures that would authorize public officials to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
Thus, they are referred to as homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can serve to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim damages of at least $10,000 (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who produces, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost weapon" components or kits for their production in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private prosecution, then that’s exactly what we should do,” he said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas model, the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict against the extension of the legal mechanism to other U.S. states, would be confirmed.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas’s abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against select officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually coming to an understanding of what the vaccination schedule will look like, and there is also an improvement in the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, there is already a large-scale study of the effects of the 4 dose.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on the inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10x more effectiveness, should be launched in a short time.

Poland has threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act against the law if it exercised new powers and stopped paying money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland halt its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully withholding funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister added.
His party's approach to the EU takes a more radical stance than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone in Ziob’s work threaten its independence and make it subordinate to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is building “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw is facing “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of a colony," he said.
But to admit it... they have one kind of cheese in Lidl in four different places.
I did not look at other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks I gave up and asked myself.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector, they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is a eviction, there is no market or smell, there is no action, there is a golden shop on the square, maybe they do not have such a choice, but they usually have absolutely everything I need and it has some order, so I am ready in ten minutes.

For two years, I've been looking at how the data is handled here like manure, most of the vaccine proponents are just a little bit more out of the loop than most of the vaccine proponents.

Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: Vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.

Wow, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outing and wish you all a nice day.
When I was a child, I was punished with a cookie.
It was never because of the signs, usually just because I repeatedly refused to listen and became angry (read instead of going to bed, fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "snap" I just brought the cake and put it so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, did I get a few stab wounds on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than words.
In my opinion, the warning part is important, because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether he will not listen and get, or improve and the punishment will not.
In the end, it was mostly just a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl, answered a journalist’s question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether a sacred document he swore an oath to learn about in school, or an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he definitely appealed to the Prime Minister.
We once agreed in the Constitution on democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with the changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl voiced the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion among lawyers is increasingly emerging that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs change.
The years are tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, though, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the politicians mantinela games.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are banning politicians.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is becoming milder among children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly in recent times.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, the mayor of the Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic of the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University.
The process is much easier, easier, and often goes without symptoms.
But there are children who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
This takes place at the Children's Infectious Diseases Clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward, according to the doctor, continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adults and adolescents, as well as a few-month-old baby.
In hospitals, children are also in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"Currently, we have a child of several months of age and adolescence," the mayor said.
However, he is glad that in the children's hospital FN Brno have not yet recorded any child deaths due to coronavirus.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the psychologist’s cooperation.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, as in adults, as well as in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccination dose in children," the doctor added.
In a quiet area you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the calm zone you can walk anywhere (but do not go over the fence into the field).
Skiing/biking in the woods outside the marked path is not allowed unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much looked after outside the national park).

China is building the impression of a managed disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Jiroush: China is creating the impression that the disease is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a number of medical and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now, the country is reporting a zero-sum increase in infections.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping a lot in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in Italy, which is the worst-affected country.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of a friend meets a friend and tells him, “Look, you don’t want an elephant?”
I got it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she saves the grass, she washes the car with a sledgehammer, the children play with it.
Well, that's great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Well, let's get to it, it's going to be great.
After a while, they meet and the one who bought it complains: "Dude, what did you sell for an elephant???
The lawn is laid bare, there's huge shit everywhere, the car's broken down, the kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says, "You're talking about an elephant, you're not selling an elephant like that."
The world is controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
It is still functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will work out.
I thought about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm a dictionary expert.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment on "Spanish oranges and mandarins", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, while for "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term, and there is no need to further specify it with American forces.
Again, maybe just a word :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical demand.
There was a five-degree earthquake in Tokyo, Japan.
Japan's Tokyo and surrounding areas were hit by a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damage had been reported so far.
No tsunami warning has been issued, according to Reuters.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of spaceman Milly
Terrible footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crawled into a toilet bowl before its senseless owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
A court in Gwent has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun reported.
Experts on the rehabilitation of monkeys, who take care of Milly after her treatment, said they had never seen such a frightened cosmonaut before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother has pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrate's Court, she was sentenced to twelve weeks' imprisonment with a suspended sentence of one year.
Hollande was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid labour, a life-long ban on animal husbandry and has to pay a recalculation of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She shrieked and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she settles down and is satisfied with the male, her gaze on new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's rubbing came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage of her wife's phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
You can hear Milly blabbering on the set.
In the next video, you can hear a Dutch monkey offering cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, confessed to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 (fewer than <0xC2><0xA3>50,000) hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from that old age three times in a row when you bravely leap across the whole of the 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same things in first grade as you did in sixth grade?
And all this kills the idea of bifling, when no one, except honor, cares if you know or understand it.
Write a test on 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Go and randomly on the street people ask if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even scratch their heads and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people do not want and do not need.
And in that moment, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this to stand at the machine, I meant it very seriously because you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly get to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably what our communist past and anger against the educated and elites are also involved in) But the cost of having barbarians on our machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, then the covid probably never reached this size.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right now,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to a plethora of questions from curious fans, which disappointed her on Kadrim so much that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it has been creeping since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move after her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual contempt and hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he was angry with Kadri's turn in response to Andreina's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty was no longer liked by his ex-wife, even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop her brother in public.
I don’t normally talk about things like that at all, and we’ve never said that much in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn’t give it to me!
I’m sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm even more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would really like to get to know Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and family, is in the confession in response to the words of Andrea.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know what it really was, she added uncertainly.
The drunk thief climbed up the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbing expedition in a parking lot in the residential district, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually evacuated 330 crowns from one vehicle in a recalculation.
After that, there was nothing better than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
On one security camera, he is captured walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then stopped Chaa.
The man confessed that he had drunk some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed the money, he decided to walk away drunk.
The whole thing is under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effectively tied to pandemic preparedness.
If the law is repealed, it will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of the business
Isn't that enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but never abolished.
On Saturday, more than 60 percent of the electorate voted in the four municipalities.
The new representative offices were elected on Saturday in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a on Uherskohradist<0xC5><0xA1>t'sk, Luzice on Mosteck, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves on Liberecka and Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> on Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovska.

There were a total of 99 candidates running for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very closely watched election to the Chamber of Deputies, said the Vice-President of the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> Eva Krumpov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
The Independent Candidates’ Association won Saturday’s election in Komna, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member parliament.
The candidate of STAN received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.

The former mayor of Jana K<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, who is a member of the Privromn<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC3><0xBD>k family, has again joined the council.
For one mandate in the representative office, Kom<0xC5><0x88>an<0xC3><0xA1> – independent candidates have achieved.
75.48 per cent of eligible voters attended the polls.
In the village of Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> on Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk, the association Pro Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> won.

Voter turnout was 93.62%.
Repeated elections in Lusatia on Mostek were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svin<0xC4><0x8D>ice led by Mayor Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich John.
It gained 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, it has four seats in the seven-member parliament.
The second ended the candidate Municipality for the People, which gave the vote 43.27 percent of the voters, so in the representative office will have three representatives.
76.7% of the electorate voted in the polls.
The elections in Nova Ves in Liberec were won by the independent candidates of Hope for Nova Ves before the YES Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the vote, and against a proper election in 2018, it strengthened, gained a mandate more and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write about here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, it is sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
I don’t care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell his head down from ten feet.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall was experienced on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the Regional Health Rescue Service intervened.
The employees of the regional operations center took over an hour after Saturday's midnight emergency call with initial information about the fall of the man from a height.
Two crews of ZZS – medical and medical – immediately went to the site.
After arriving at the site, the medics found that a twenty-seven-year-old man was supposed to fall from a window about twelve meters high and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal was caught in the mines.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and in direct danger of life.
The interventionist doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures as part of the pre-hospital emergency care, his ambulance transported him to the further care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Humpl.
I am more concerned than with the coronavirus about inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the disease there are mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 tournament was a big deal.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not found a winner in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light weight, showed against Dustin Poirier a great strangulation and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly toppled Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
His opponent was also defeated by Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This led to a women's bantamweight match between Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the path to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, she did not allow herself to be forced to make any other mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honored with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, the money took Nunes to the ground, where she began to cut her.
She had to give up and give up the attack.
The American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Poirier was better off at first, but the card gradually started to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to overcome the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not manage to do so, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got his opponent on his back and inflicted a series of blows on him.
He won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the contractions off.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right back on Rauliana Paiva in the first round, won the match.
He was then hit by a series of precisely measured strokes and recorded a fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip, or the hip?
At first glance, it is not difficult.
Most nouns in Czech have only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are male, female or middle.
Then there is also a relatively large group of significant names, in which the gender is not constant.
Such essential names fluctuate between the two genera.
When leaning, they then acquire two ends and in some cases remain in an unflattering form.
For example, the words "sweezes" or "kichel" are of the male and female lineage, in the first they are inclined according to the pattern of "machine", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
For other groups of essential names, the forms are already different in the first case of the unit number, for example: ‘row/row’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are illustrative, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "oak" in Bohemia and "oak" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unscriptural, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "crop" and "crop", "bucket" and "bucket" etc.
Some words that have penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were originally intransigent, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is a male and female family, or the word "buffet", which has remained indiscriminate in the middle family, but in the male it has endings following the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
Tensions are mounting on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to march to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support for Greece, humanitarian aid is also being provided by the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like right on the spot?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're choking, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of acres of land.
How do the local authorities and the residents themselves deal with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent drastic impacts, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelov<0xC3><0xA1> talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrichov<0xC3><0xA1>.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to ban it.
I don’t know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how these people are often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It’s disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “a large part of the accusation is made up” and that it’s a “trend” you’re only helping sexual abusers.
Czechs flood outbuildings, families don’t have money to finish
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a sticky situation because of that.
She does not have the funds to complete her extended family homes and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works is also increased.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already deployed family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
At best, people move into dislocated and unincorporated homes.
In the worst case, detached houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and to pay rents," says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We will build two to three family houses a year and at fifty percent it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become expensive.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the building of the house going to be five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
Of the material most irritated copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in the construction industry and the influx of foreign workers is hampering the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favorable.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're fine and we'll be even better.
But the real vision is missing, says CRO commentator – mujRozhlas
In addition to the traditional celebrations, entering the New Year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of the YES Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the President of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn that was essential?
As it comes to me the diploma super right, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I continue on to the bachelor's degree, I always do it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The captains are completely at peace with us, if a man is not a total macaque and something is left in his head, then the commission will not stifle him unnecessarily on theory.
I may have studied for a week at the state house and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical diversion, which I immediately got and I was right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project (we have done it many times, really beneficial, they will learn a lot) and then they will just learn the project and they have aged.
I think it’s great when at the end of the course there’s an exam that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't send any e-mails and phone calls, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of a teddy bear.
You have to give it to Xi Jinping to get his ass kicked or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing the artists under their feet.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, the furt changes which function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been really bugging me lately, so maybe I'll have to cut back to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and won't let me do it.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-friendly come along that doesn’t take away all the creativity and energy from the artists.
Statement by the parties working in the Donbas
The alliance – yes, the break-up – no, they express in the picture their opinion of the opponents of the break-up of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Krav<0xC4><0x8D>uk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open conciliatory position of Mikhail S. Gorba<0xC4><0x8D>ov, secretly, regardless of the people, signed the agreement.
With a single cut of the pen, they “abolished” a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has declined by 10 million to 11 million.
Regardless of the loss of the population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years in one sitting in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They have deliberately de-industrialized, stymied agriculture, cut off fourteen republics from the world’s largest power, which were previously economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the decline of the population, the disintegration of the economy, of science, of the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, all the wars in Yugoslavia, the Arab world.
There is such a concept in political science as the “vacuum of force”.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered quickly filled and conquered the countries of NATO that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have in the supermarket some meat that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and turning it into a Thursday dinner.
In the alternative reality, in which I will not buy this meat on Monday, it will be reduced to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and this meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK of yeast and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
These bullshit about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt or poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the basement the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigades, they can not throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of peasant reason and conservative views on the workings of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be such an agitation.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, he was a good mattress, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, and that's why the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to satisfy that person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is in the world.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried so much and on her knees begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then another half year went by and it started to shake her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch any freaks again.
Such a person exudes feelings, emotions and joy in general.
I'd rather keep my distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbing themselves by buying a cloud of tests and chasing the positives, who would not even know about the terrible disease of not being tested.
The only thing we achieve is a complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of home prison.
In the West, they've already stopped playing chess, and they've admitted that it's no use dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately W<0xC3><0xA1>lek is new and he has to steal something else and drive his ego by inventing bouncy castles.
I see the good old bastard is coming back.
After several years of attenuation and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is once again back on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at V<0xC5><0xA0>), the initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't need to be interested, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products that I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and ikecat a person.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to inflate several certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, that is, one felt like a sub-domestic seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned that one should not jump on every spike and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fatty" accounts.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporate world where I work.
HR is at peace, managers are looking at their management and they don’t put too much pressure on us.
So the regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form in which it is happening in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it is rather a self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels like we’re such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so don't bother us too much as long as the results are there.
The Czech Republic is missing in the UK after his death.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched unsuccessfully for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradistsk had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide more information on the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek said on Twitter.
The last time they saw a young woman on the bus was on November 28 while she was on her way home from work, and she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues at work five days later.
Later, the London police began to search for her, Interpol ranked her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspects, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new councillors were appointed.
On Saturday, December 11, new representative offices were elected in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a na Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>k, Luzice na Mostecka, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves na Liberecka and Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> na Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected representative offices have fallen.
There were 99 valid candidates for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was registered in the village of Rovn<0xC3><0xA1>, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate papers were registered for the new elections to the representative offices in these four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men took part in the 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, said Eva Krumpov<0xC3><0xA1>, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease here took me a while at the very beginning, but it was possible without any major tremors.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population in all its layers is going to be, I have a problem with that so far.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on other people not being an asshole.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the ability to re-acquire it.
Chances are that it will happen, but as others here mention very little.
Moreover, I'm not sure that the corroborated file could even be considered treason.
Velezrada is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex increases year-round
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who give up their sex lives rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35, who said they had not had sex in the last year, are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a study by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But it could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sex in the previous year has increased rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, a researcher at IFS.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them reporting having had no sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 years of age is still declining.
Young people's opinion of premarital sex divides, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
“It’s true that among single individuals in this age group, they’re in the minority, but their behavior shifts this trend,” Stone says of those thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, it is a reason for religious establishment.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60 per cent for single people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the “less faithful,” the trend rose from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic.
Studies have also shown that sex is less likely in people who are out of work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend was mainly behind the lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against Covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to behave that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have been in the death of an 80-year-old man who didn’t really know much, we didn’t explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn’t get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who here along with the SPD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C> is shouting something about the bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign in the fight against drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snow sections in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts will not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizera Fifties.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about a bunny.
Once in high school, the teacher took us across town to the shipyard so we could ride on boats across the river.
On the way there we went once on a fairly wide street and who we do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they've got us covered.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they got into a conversation with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly show that it will not accept violations of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of the Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders is a Western one to deal with using diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the “Norman group” uniting France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially triggered a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, as we see hundreds of attempts every night to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor to finally make sure that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured that Warsaw was enjoying German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime by the refugees.
Drunk Polish nun blamed accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could lose her driver’s license in the event of a sudden loss of priority in driving and getting caught from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun had bumped into the vehicle, asking for her help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
She was crushed by a breath test, and after they found out that she had more than two vials in her blood, they immediately removed her driver's license.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have looked into American stories about pet dogs.
But at the same time, they forgot about the essential thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the quirky F. Brabce Gump movie - the dog that taught people to live, now there is another film about the audience emotions in the cinemas.
Co-author of the screenplay and director in one person Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> ml. freely follows his previous film Here I Watch in 2012.
The talking hedgehog Hugo and some famous characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Pension, who is dying, and so they begin to invite the dog owner, Julia's father with her partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (who is also the producer of the film) had already faced the procedures of storytelling in the previous dog picture, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's get this over with.
Julie, though a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in the desire of the child, and if the "constellation" is correct, the "constellation" is co-opted with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are – on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course, during the excursion with the local guide), the "constellation" is not out of the way.
Nothing against the pure treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the content of the film, full of incredible situations and figures, which was needed for this message.
A couple of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog breeders, a <0xC5><0xA0>umava charlatan, police officers coming to the premises to look for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which baked family in the pension will of course drink.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and suddenly sits na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and loaded with cigars at the family table, demanding her father’s whisky and flake as a cured vegetarian, she can’t help but laugh.
On top of that, the viewer’s creator will explain that “this sometimes happens after a coma”.
<0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>'s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build load-bearing situations, a sense of character and point and direction.
The acting performance is unbalanced, the cut is unhelpful and the overall impression is palpable.
No matter how Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vakul<0xC3><0xAD>k, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1> or Nela Boudov<0xC3><0xA1> try to stop their party, they don’t have much to play for.
The only plot of the film remains poetic images of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava nature of cameraman Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Holomek and a pair of jezev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a loose plot and dog statements, let alone more popular vulgar expressions, which the characters are allowed to use.
The argument is not even a long-term membership in the Breeders' Club - as in the case of the female producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a credible story.
This did not work in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of affection for the genre.
Not even as an advertisement for canistherapy would pass this amateurishly conceived piece.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant insinuations from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you fucking understand it, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to that kind of kid, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case, a pay-as-you-go brigade.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term rainfall average in November.
The two-day rain this week was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here in a long time.
It’s also the right Christmas backdrop, enjoyed by the Nazareth resident Wasi Askar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is bumpy and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater source, Lake Galilee, filled the edge this spring with the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here,” Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israel Water Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan’s capital, Amman, tankers are on the rise.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
“This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” said Imad Suleyman, the tanker’s driver.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local river basin was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the Vienna talks had brought “no progress” and had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and that world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled her in the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these hoaxes, I've been teasing the missus with doubts and questions for a while now, and I've finally thanked her and left.
Don't tell me I'm a bully, but the pyramid is the pyramid and the financial advisors are the financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major push of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
The skier has not waived his obligation to prove himself with a Covid certificate.
While skiers don’t complain about customer disinterest, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to the cross-country trails and ski slopes over the weekend.
The skiers wanted the weather, which offered today the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill," praised the director of the Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Sports Complex Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also in Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the ski resort in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk<0xC3><0xA1> was opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimate of 400 people.
The conditions are consistent.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> Rostislav Proch<0xC3><0xA1>zka.
Ski resort operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are within the time limit after getting COVID-19.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK René Hrone<0xC5><0xA1> from the ski center <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n.
"We've only detected incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in ski rental.
It’s not the same as in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Opava shop Skiopava.
More effort is expected in the period of ski courses.
David <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k, CEO of Snowbear, also feels that due to covid, there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to him, people with the pandemic have become lazy and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by the rental company in the Novako area on God’s Gift.
They started renting skis there a week ago and now they have to be ordered in advance.
"We are starting to lend runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the operator of the resort.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is, according to her, also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are smart and smart people going abroad who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company will not go abroad.
But with the rest, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n winning one beautiful day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next issue is elections.
If it's going to be bad here, some traditional V4 crazy guy can win here, too.
The young and the educated will leave, its supporters and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
Terrible photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand, the crew of the film Island, led by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech Republic.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Peter's disappearance does not resemble her behavior at all, and we are starting to be very concerned about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnco worked, said in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic, according to her, left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
She worked as a "nurse nurse" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We have tremendous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find to contact the police," the statement continued.
The public is also invited to cooperate with MP Harriet Harman, who pointed out the case of Srncova at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC's website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are magnifying the threat of the Invasion and is beginning to have our entrance full of teeth.
I was quoting at the top.
I don't know what you think Russia wants war from.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in the year 38 is beyond so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can now compare this to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what "concentration" at the borders would be like.
I am a servant...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which relate in particular to suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
Mladoboleslavska is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital since Sunday, the rapids from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice stop in the station Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto.
In suburban train transport, trains S7 will depart, which on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod pass through Prague's main station.
In the recently opened station Prague-Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto will stop the R17 from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov.
The PID will be extended to other areas.
Among other things, there are buses to Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tl<0xC3><0xA1> nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Star<0xC3><0xBD> Splav<0xC3><0xBD> and Turnov.
There will be included buses to Mladoboleslavsk, including lines with crossings to Liberec and Kralovehradeck<0xC3><0xBD> regions.
77 lines will be cancelled during the integration, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
There will be a new bus line 405 from Prague Zlic<0xC3><0xAD>n, which will go all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atce.
There is also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, which replaces the canceled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning peak and on the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, when the new express line number 404 will be issued.
In the new PID system, lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are included.
They leave St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>kov metro station, not Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice station.
Line 400 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, Dub<0xC3><0xA1> and <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikova.
The additional line 410 goes via M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k and Dub<0xC3><0xA1> to Doks, Mimona and Jablonn<0xC3><0xBD> in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, new operations on ten local routes in Central Bohemia, including Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mit<0xC3><0xA1>l under T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>n, have been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Changes are also expected for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevska.
Routes 540 to 543 to Nymbursk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovick in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don’t have any exercise, I don’t have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as much as possible healthy and dietary.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy a maximum of pizza chips and a snack of yoghurt and apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone expects snow like you do, so unfortunately it is.
It’s not about the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If destroyed, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're being banned from off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confession of the Gift of a Relationship with the Doubter: This is not what I was happy about at all
The Czech show business pond has been alive since Friday, revealing the relationship between Dara Rollins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da.
They’ve been pulling it off for years, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent an extensive message to fans explaining why she has been hiding love from them for half a year.
"I allow myself to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara caught a bear, that is, sorry, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da," jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they do not have the joy of it.
And it's right here.
What we both didn’t enjoy, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who do not care at all, and it jumps out at them from the can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough, or you insisted that everyone really know in detail the list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a bite, you want it, it bothers Dar<0xC3><0xAB>.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
He has long served as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the end of Nedwid's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are only three weeks apart on paper.
In any case, to those who are happy with us and wish us this, we thank you.
We too are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband, and just like he loves me, I stand by him, in good and in bad," Rollins concluded.
Hello, the other commenters have probably already said all the essentials, I just confirm that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and chatted during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems like the best option because you know who you will be living with.
The apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but looking at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, certainly avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, French etc., this is a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> district is very student, the King's Field and in this direction it's fine, besides it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know where exactly you are going).
I have never been a renter, but I am a native of Brno, so I can advise Brno as such if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it out of their own way or they go according to the state and it pays the state.
After all, we cannot allow a private actor to control a piece of education just because a few crowns will be awarded to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim is somewhat lost in weight when it is written by a man who, two days before, had expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against whether someone is going to have an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloguing / digitization that (and even long-time professionals) it either catches the eye, or they write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I would probably not recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd like to deal with this in some way in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a good and hard-working student, you can look into some character databases and search for the one closest to you.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits to what's physically on that coin.
PS: Is it more of an Odry Empire (kingdom) than OdryNsk<0xC3><0xA1>?
P.S. Someone has already told you this.
Check out this comment with Phil.
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
This is a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suited to informal contacts, the establishment of high-standard relationships.
In addition, with English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand that hat on Ceyl.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times do I leave work at 10 p.m. and never a problem?
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly stepped in there in life.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is they block the sidewalk and park where they don’t have :D it’s definitely not that I’m afraid to go out there in the evening on the street.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, then I would go for it.
A lot of apartments are now there newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dada and mistress Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1> like a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people at the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dad's wreath and Lucie must have one too, said the Lightning saxophonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anica, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: Back together!
But we were still talking, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure Dad and Lucia will buy something, like perfume.
"I'm a gentleman," added Felix, who himself came to the club's Richman club for a music video.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was happy to meet his wife Ludek Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltov<0xC3><0xA1>.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in crisis.
There are few police officers and they can’t afford it, so are firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the water has run out in mountain and sub-mountain areas, with a smaller total rainfall recorded even in places where there has been no need for moisture so far.
The cause of drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact also reinforces the way we manage land.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, I'll be right there, I can barely keep up on the ice skates, I know what it's like to play hockey, and the tactics (which I've tried in the Hockey Manager franchise) are also a total hoax.
And whether you're a "Bear Russia" or a "Lama China" hockey team, losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when compared.
But as much as I listen to Czech commentators spewing out what the referees don’t notice, whether it’s men’s or women’s hockey, it’s all weird, but that’s probably the case with all sports, UEFA and “Italian players” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around it is as usual and that the Czech Republic and Russia have already lost more often than they have won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5,766 people were hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic in 1967 is 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest number of days since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large-wave disease caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Safety Authority, said on TV on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron-infected people are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to rise.
So far, no one has died of omicrone, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when he had a lockdown and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson administration minister argued that the quiz was conducted “virtually” over a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers on Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers held numerous rallies despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are outraged that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from office as prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly the events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections that could end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
These will be elections of European significance.
How much can you expect to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free, because there were not even the last two elections under Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
In the past, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether he would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is a big deal for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power to play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
Recently, a recording by the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xB3> K<0xC3><0xB6>vér has been leaked to independent media, where she explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news stories.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't either, her dad has a long time, but then he beats extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time I was very choleric and I was angry as a little girl terribly, to the extent that I lay on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, it took me 2x under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they painted me in the nursery, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now too, as a child I was quite struggling, now I have to beat myself up to something and as a younger parent I may have clapped over my hand for example (so as not to get too much over the posture), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly this education has its share as well.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose my patience with the kids, too, and I'm going to deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents should not do it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks something, maybe it is not possible to not do it a little bit.
I don't mind, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call the customers the ones who make the laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying a product and you will have to pay for a mortgage?
Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner's monstrous world.
Where does Slovakia move the trial with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four defendants in the murder of J<0xC3><0xA1>n Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She has been active in civil society, but has also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the tops of Slovak politics and justice.
How will the process be a major breakthrough for Slovakia?
Journalists can do a lot for this.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the anti-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled, and the company bounced back.
He died of Covid six months ago on Czech television.
Next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage anywhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is at the end and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government has interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government after years of delays by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on storage, which is promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by Czech atomic law and European directives.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposal of the law from the Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who has the Platform at his disposal, is made by the municipalities in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of location for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be effective if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the commencement of a specific procedure.
The proposed objective almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a location for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities, in fact, according to today's legal standards, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the office or the minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued.
The action in question does not have a suspensory effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
Self-government co-decision, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and linked to the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zem<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is approximately CZK 4 million.
Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hr<0xC3><0xA1>dek locality and spokesman of the Platform against Deep Storage said: After the industry ministers, who are aligning the position of self-governments with the state authorities when looking for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, they have only sent their successors away.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for its support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state’s approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The Platform further insists that the decision to select a location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) made to lose weight fear: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually intimidated by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took a while.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun newspaper.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the depth of the sitcom Roseanne, he's a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
"I put it all in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still,” he told ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it’s some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn’t translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are several types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has bosses several, that is, and so the "boss" is something like the master/master of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all necessary to defeat in order for the game or level to be completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games of the type Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly meet with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and so can they be called at all?
And then there's the mini-boss.
It is not possible to translate boss just one word at a time, Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (interesting is just Catalan, which translates boss as a final opponent).
It is simply a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watching completion of any level or task.
The missing Peter from London is being searched all over the world.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for Peter Srnc's missing body since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t'sk<0xC3><0xA1> has been looking for a woman since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," said police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"We share information about the case," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t'sk.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She joined in the hanging of the leaflets with Petra's face.
"We're very worried about her," she told a news conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
It is not clear who he was or what he had to do with Peter.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month, with the year-end coming to an end, attacks increased markedly.
We had a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email should draw the attention of the user to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the 11,2021...exe repair bill," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October’s data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The most common .exe filename extension found in the formbook was REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at Fareit, which accounted for 1.6 per cent of attacks and had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months, recorded a significant decline and dampening of activity.
Today's demo of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The route to Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the waterfront and in my experience of the protestor, I am not afraid of an estimate of about 10 thousand people.
The people in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people.
To the procession of about four thousand demonstrators, an unprecedented number of passers-by is spontaneously added.
I believe that something new is born here, writes Radek Mokr<0xC3><0xBD>.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers themselves, the anti-ruscans and the spol. could not fill or pay such a large parade.
The actions of the Chc<0xC3><0xAD>pl Pes association have a rising popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy abroad.
Sometimes I get the impression that they also rent the same stage and technique.
It’s hard to say what kind of movement could be placated by this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine will not become a square and more dosed.
It's certainly not a left-wing or center-right movement, bet it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines have saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of the new government of Kirill Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue in the change that won the November elections.
This has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the last government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties that declared the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the “secret” shots taken is a global hit.
Over the weekend, concerns about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman were growing in the UK, after which the London police have been investigating for several days.
Petra Srncov<0xC3><0xA1> was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, she also calls her current employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived.
"Peter's disappearance does not resemble her behavior at all, and we are starting to be very concerned about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnco worked, said in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic, according to her, left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
She worked as a "nurse nurse" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We have tremendous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find to contact the police," the statement continued.

In <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem there is a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the SSD, to which the road belongs, and because it said it did not respond, the hole went on.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the DSS began to “solve the situation intensively”.
