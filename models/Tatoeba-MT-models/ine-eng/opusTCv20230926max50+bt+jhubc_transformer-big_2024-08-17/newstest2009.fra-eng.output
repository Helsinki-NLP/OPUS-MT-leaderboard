At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange plunged into the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares accounted for almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange resumed with its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan of the US financial sector, is thus also noticeable in our country.
Falling Stocks in Asia
The Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, even though the indexes managed, over the course of the day, to wipe out some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during trades, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Chinese equities movement lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about bailout in the U.S. will affect financial markets around the world," noted Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the financial system’s support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, which it should have spent up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion K<0xC4><0x8D>).
The lawmakers thus denied the call for support for President George Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indexes experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, having fallen to such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Surrenders: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion into Banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success, however, is not certain.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological first factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, there will be "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing views on what form the package of measures for market stabilisation should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On Saturday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government a final shape.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsellable real estate assets that lead financial firms into considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on falling stock markets.
According to the Democratic senator, if Harry Reid escapes, lawmakers are making sure that Congress comes to a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors ahead of the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress’ decision could affect Monday’s trades.
For the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two houses of the US Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations will not risk being blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there will still be many changes to the law.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress gets the impression that the program is not doing its job, it has the option of blocking the granting of the remaining amount, by following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush hailed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress has the option of holding the decision in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to pass the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting contributors from losses, the settlement of setbacks, the course of the plan on the timeline.
The new law also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for property owners, who have trouble paying.
The government should negotiate new installments in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while decreasing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because we don’t know what the mechanism and price of buying up troubled assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not as important as that.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek said.
A push to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
It does not prevent that there are sufficient reasons to acquire an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are vinyl records crammed in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of at least such a gramophone.
The same is true of music on the move, namely compressed music, to put it simply - MP3 music.
Here too, there are categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble with earphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and movies, record the latter, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grill meat and no TV will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two recharges.
And playing music is one of the most important energy gophers.
Rarely are mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect them to play music for only a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is valid even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, after a recharge, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
One can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as drives are concerned, you don’t need any software, except for an exception (iPod).
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or by the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, focus on the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3.
Virtually all mobile devices are capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
All manage to play MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most widespread formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also manage to read WMA format music.
AAFC (a format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding operator’s (or other provider’s) web pages from your mobile phone and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical piece of furniture.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases it is limited to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobiles on themselves.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones on you or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which practically all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones come out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman-mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series phones have the same user menu as separately sold MP3 players, is the one that went the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on Mobil.cz, that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no longer room for another operator, made a fuss with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network apparently no longer has much luck (by the way, now it would be difficult to find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which, subsequently, conventional operators also had to react.
Yet, even before the advent of holiday troubles such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind the Mobilking there is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited range of services.
For example, in the UK, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, relying on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work in our country as well.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of enterprise customers, has not hidden, for quite some time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not estimate that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to others.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telefonika O2's press department, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now.”
Instead, Vodafone focuses its attention on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in consultation with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a drop in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the emergence of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to hear each other as thieves at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> at the time of the creation of the U:fon was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
But today, the U:fon is ready to be used as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> noted in this regard: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this kind has been concluded at this time, as the supply of potential interested parties has a priori not shown sufficient interest for conventional operators," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS said in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not be surprising from the operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Even more so as Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Foreignly, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile phone services."
However, putting pressure in the direction of an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline that is strictly the same at all service stations is probably due to chance and the fierce competition.
"The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for its behaviour in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the OHIM that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Bringing down responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>TU is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the matter.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent renewal of the Telecommunications Act, which was adopted recently, has not succeeded in extending the powers of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one is looking, it can work.
That said, the operation of some sort of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Custom mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick is that the company in front of the operator is a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
“If what you are referring to were to happen, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and which could result in a cessation of collaboration with the company in question,” Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is opposed to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them considerable profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they can not fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>TU.
In addition, there is another question to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, the classical operators sometimes tried more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory agencies deal with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in their skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw the handle after the heist.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS can hardly remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously confided to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that we understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse des savetiers), an original Czech piece by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>vice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Lek<0xC3><0xBD>y zahrad, And<0xC4><0x9B>l,
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons online on the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik website: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget about the counters in the metro stations, where they had until now to tread with impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and it will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is a ticket office with trained staff available for passengers, who will help those interested with the online purchase and, in addition, register the coupon they have purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to register the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An automaton will control the coupon in place of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
Namely, in suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> integravan<0xC3><0xA1> doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons; "explained the control of tickets Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of public transport.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the crate.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
“In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires can rejoin the vending machines, originally used to store the coupons on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetenland calls for a referendum in the US
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> v<0xC4><0x9B>deck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This is due, among other things, to a letter preserved in a private archive, which is today deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> v<0xC4><0x9B>deck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov's Germans asked the US president in the letter not to allow "<0xC5><0xA0>umavsk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation well and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “People, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is at heart.”
Given that the rapprochement with Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, reckless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take into his hands the protectorate of the <0xC5><0xA0>um pourava always and now.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to get a certain kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms it.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic States.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them the Czech language.
“They believed that once they got back home, the Czech would benefit them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
Don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The action aimed at the most expensive road safety in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign with the intention of launching, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, she wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially the personal stories that will attack the emotions.
It also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The phrase "Don't think about it" is capitalized on the registration plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the phrase "Tu paieras".
This must symbolize that one can pay with one’s life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "handle" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry drew inspiration from similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
“What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whipping.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when grilling a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, according to the psychologist.
According to him, the signs signaling the danger to the drivers are already less effective.
“When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, advocated the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) territories, or even all," Olmert says daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed support for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to terrorism from Hamas (Shiite movement), from Al-Qaeda (terrorist network), as well as from Iraq’s Prime Minister (Da’esh).
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this equipment for standing seats is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; this has been confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
“This is a matter that we have dealt with with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got the passengers to go to the toilet during the trip as long as they had their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the steward role - no legal prescription takes care of that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport knows only the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds spokesman Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently deals with the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has permission in its approval to offer standing seats.
It’s all in there,” he said.
The coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats and higher permitted speed, and long-distance coaches without standing with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
There, too, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the hostess of the air can shake her head."
"But in the event that the coach braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal regulations," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewardship services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a risky profession.
“However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The concern for safety is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We've been opposed to them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing light and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he ran over it by his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the works for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movements of the stewards on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, adding that the control of the safety of buses is under the control of the police and the office for safety at work.
The hopes of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the financial institute of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "block of competence" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive trigger for other concentrations in the banking sector in the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the injured WestLB is still under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
For some time now, however, there has been talk - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's clients through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Indeed, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made it known at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, be it the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks and savings bank groups, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct negotiations with the WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said, in the financial center.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers on the Frankfurt financial centre, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
However, nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse was against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join either.
The Bank of the Rhineland Palatinate was attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks.
Finally, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba steering committee, had, however, spoken out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election in the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could come to fruition in the first place.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, pulled a lock earlier this year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, which is the commercial model by which the future capacity of L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks should be ensured, had not yet been resolved by the German grouping of savings banks and bank transfers.
In the long run, a peeling of the WestLb could take place, peeling which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter from the existing Steering Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' for the establishment would be envisaged.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds its goiter can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses him.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take off tonight at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses traveling Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing in gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three shots just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses run at night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates once again make a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning Marco’s group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Place Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, wear the little yellow hat.
From above it is written on the left <0x60>Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: “When the gates of the beer capital open, we run,” Marco shouts in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, Marco cries, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instruction!
<0x60>Show the security agents that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: <0x60>Tonight, to be back here ten and a half hours ago!'
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to the trees to find the way back, to the signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'Italian weekend'.
There are no precise figures; there are 50,000 who set off through the Alps and crash into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy on express this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross who carry out a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u brewery tent.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word <0x60>relatively' and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside DAX, gets a $1 billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued for up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from private banks as well as from public-law banks.
In the background, it is the company-daughter Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period the previous year, earnings from the allocation of receivables and determined securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern’s companies that the deficit in earnings of about 16 percent turned out to be mod.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had at first speculated poorly on industrial real estate loans, which had then been branched out to Aareal bank.
Because conventional state financing was not sufficiently cost-effective, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that still remains rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had already been truncated to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks has again increased considerably, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term means of refinancing for part of the total amount of Depfa's loans - approximately 50 billion euros - annually.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s need for financing is covered with medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of business at the moment.
Other sources say the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (Bafin) assume that Hypo Real Group’s market capacity is now secured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have only to hope for.
However, given the dynamics and weightlessness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is also not inconceivable that funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest announcements, still on the verge of insolvency on Sunday evening, this rescue, at least provisionally, will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices are doing particularly well.
While debt in the first place has barely moved, the prices of second-tier loans are dwindling.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg subsidiary Hypo and those of course that have a life beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the bank Deffa.
As long as the issuing institutes, governments and commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it is possible to assume a resorption of arrears over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should set aside sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors on deciding whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line on to constitute a deferral of losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax from automatically-drawn stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due for her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so kawaii!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of classes in Japan.
What was I excited about?
The way to go to school already scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not at all like talking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on my foster mother's old skirt, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit so, I presented myself to the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low mass, grinned and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all pulled out their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salt plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here as well.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always answered:
“Because it fascinates me, what?”
In the end, reading manga is what I’ve preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
The rats also have sensations.
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it until now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hard-to-perform terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our experience subjective to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being related to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses big problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be the same.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does that mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its aftermath, such as the body’s reactions) takes hold of vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of the cortical sensation of the cortex and the brain stem, just as Jaak Pankseep who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe this is inescapable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how can one still verify whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the cause of the sensations?
And even if we could prove it for humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is nerve-wracking to the extent that the same is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bumping into a wall.
I am an emotional pragmatist.
Platini, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian League President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us.
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured the UEFA President in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not be affected."
Several members of the Premier League have already been convicted in the previous season of mandatory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League has even had to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulteress Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a disgraceful battle - seen and known by everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have known the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her unfaithful husband’s claim was clear: “It would be monstrous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, “Meg is once again reshaping the history of our relationship and manipulating it.”
It would be even more "regrettable" that "the pain and upheaval of divorce for every child is rekindled in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the call: “At any rate, my life goes on.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing the best it can.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
The flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after price increases in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities under review.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reasons for all this would reside for American Express in the low price of the dollar which has led to a "descending travel envy of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are holding up with a 26.3 percent rise, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel users, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, ticket prices in economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be a weakening economic growth, the firm says.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the "Open Sky" treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return to the game until late and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger snarled in the hallway of the dressing room of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the changing rooms, the half-time was over and most of them had rallied in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as many former protagonists.
And that is why his application was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation has failed.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wanted to be more relaxed too".
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not do harm to the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Marin Jol summed up.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-comers - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as FC Bayern's debauched Jansen - is slowly forming, but it is not yet shining.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” demanded Jol.
After the failure of the vote
In Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in all of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market index stood at 10,579 points with a drop of five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The Dow Jones losers were on that date American Express losing almost 14 percent and Bank of America losing about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank declined by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds must be mobilized to purchase what is known as spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in correlation with the course of the exchange in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlpool in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not absolve investors of their concerns.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is collapsing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The stock of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three-quarters of its value at the moment despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank has accused a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax has clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and was at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were worried that the US government’s $700 billion bailout plan might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has declined by 3.2 percent at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they get an extra thrust into the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what are called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have communicated in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health status,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are doing well and are safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shootout before the hostages were released remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to ending the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages, when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot down six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper El Masri El Jom said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to free the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law" that led to suicide
A court has been told that years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman committing suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent conduct.
Truro’s grand jury said he regularly tied his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandied her before forcing her into sexual acts while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an assiduous National Trust volunteer, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 to be "emotionally dead," and had "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the beautiful father of his daughter who had otherwise written a confession letter that ended as follows: "I tied and bandaged her regularly".
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Justice Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re really weird as a fetishist, your victim certainly had to be terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly stress, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC reported.
The man from the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of its work related to the Associated Secret Service Committee.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Companies of the building facing the bill B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots...
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously... now have to pay some of the institutions' bills that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the commercial committee for building companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for institutions that are much less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying that salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could double.
Since the building companies are non-shareholding organizations, their members end up paying the bill either at higher charges, or at lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five pence per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-pence increase in February, following a search by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn increase the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been last varied, in 2002.
A former PM of Bangladesh was refused bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who risks being arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s all-time rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his Awani League party has demanded that the country's interim military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying she does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
“We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to seek treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The United Nations last week conducted a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has not been able to reach children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its case following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said MSkyB's involvement in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV shares cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all against this purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutors' case.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing was born from the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some departmental officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
“Serious, unfounded allegations of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the dismissal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were fired because of poor benefits.
But it later emerged that the fired prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate charges of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting legal proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Justice Department also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales's role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," succeeding remarkably not to be involved in this case.
Other departmental officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, have been critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The evening of the award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly makes it go away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English charts, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in her vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to give directions to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to renovate Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house floor.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owner committees, city agency representatives and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
“They could propose to put it back into state and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to renovate the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay’s spokesperson, said that while the company wants to operate the street, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to re-look at this abandoned driveway, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further emphasizing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe Extra Place has been named after Philip Minthorne since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The CBGB's back entrance, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, twigs, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be put in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs smoothly down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the headquarters of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a 22-ounce empty beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested highlighting it.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he thought that some subs were estimating the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, wet, disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California studies, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think. Why Middle Class Should Be Able to Choose Their School.”
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign highlights that “African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports among so many other topics, “transitional bilingual education” for those learning English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English, goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students at this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state exam of maths, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-Language-Arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to a different ingredient than the one Mr. Obama put forward.
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment, and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has established the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his huge support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he is supportive of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of laws in the English language.
On the contrary, he said, “you need to make sure that your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, he should then carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Oil Drops Following New Economic Concerns in the World
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people worried that the bailout plan in favor of financial markets would not bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange, in sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After seeing an increase to $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep financial market uncertainties.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frantic negotiations, concluded with the bailout deal, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and in particular, in China.”
The bank's analysts lowered their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, so they were forced to lower oil and gas prices by 20 per cent for 2009.
The Second Time Party Determines the Team's Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a jump forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds into the halftime.
"I'm not out of my zone," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
“He’s a poor player.”
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and made 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball slip because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could score in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe the madness, said "the second time or the third time?"
When he was told both- the Jets let 21 undisputed points pass in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, has once again proven himself worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, having broken his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat by 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At 35 years old, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing—perhaps exaggeratedly in today’s eyes—that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees from the start, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross country runners, have contributed to the decline in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 .
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I went there last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He has been accused – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s African rival – of over-orchestrating his races, avoiding world marathon stars, actually counting on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a cross-country runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City of Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make these days." The city has five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison.
It has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival held annually in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city it describes--has become touristy thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project--remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that Florida’s black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who “knowing so little, doesn’t know what she’s losing.”
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious from the outside.
"We're very careful about how we tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-time resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It represents both a historic model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of a southern black rural culture—sometimes disdainful, sometimes acclaimed—that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, which ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to Eatonville's first mayor's property store, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she writes, "you'll find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve people passing by.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well "said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young daughters whom Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty."
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin recounted, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds, swinging in his back patio chair that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in any grave, at Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted a five-lane highway in the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute led to hatred at the doors of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of young white people were coming to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the sidelines,” Franklin said.
"A lady even died."
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents are now proclaiming that eliminating racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened young people's confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember it well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as head of the Community Safeguards Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white -- I mean there's a line of cultural demarcation here," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, have made it possible to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as her, armed with joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
This is beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to American guns.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up by saying that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (named of course Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent repainted Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a backstreet on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover Eatonville’s history, its raison d’<0xC3><0xAA>tre, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is from genuine civic affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most people who pass through this area will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance fluently.
Despite all this, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City, have been spending the worst “working day in the office” since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to sneak up on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos still linger among the residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic narratives until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people queueing.
Not in front of cashiers' counters, nor to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all queueing for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers like their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-strong bank, has resorted to bankruptcy trustees, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge at my building, changed the subject from our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my fruit and vegetable dealer's deliveries.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Desecrated Muslim graves as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating mosques striped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The criminals painted on several graves Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the extremists’ feelings of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the election?
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said it was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that rallied nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign, some of their slogans even being viewed by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing the scarf and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from travelling abroad.
The courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he expressed his intention to travel to Spain via France to express to the authorities who control it.
The Kent Police had issued a travel ban on Thursday after prosecutors found Glitter guilty of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there at the time.”
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even though he was registered in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter's potential travel to the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
“In our view, it’s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the most cherished intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, so he was forced to leave for Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited court in Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for possession of child abuse images.
A Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.

No heels, no starry-eyed clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy on stage ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not have to take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars.”
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, recalls classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits de vieux sportifs" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I believe that in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don’t know or that leave you only a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the Galerie El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at number 20 de la Mata street (parallel street to the People's House of Hercules) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "really bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and who passed through the Amazon.
The favorite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw about a hundred writers, historians and journalists march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by a majority of the participants’ votes, made a full appearance at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past time of his work inspired by the work of the poet, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences";
The Spanish-American novelist has admitted that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change their lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people feel less like it".
Bad weather spoils the fair of Pozoblanco
The flag party that concluded the bullfights at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse-riding bullfighters verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The bad weather has hardened on this fair, since in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
On the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday holiday took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
This afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered steps applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was blown away by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
Police officers arrested two occupants of a van and the latter two fled.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, from which to stop them.
The police chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., according to information released by the Basque Government's Interior Department.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when various officials from the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a control of the vehicles on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the lower side, where the two occupants went down to flee to a wooded area.
Basque police eventually arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a document falsification offence.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old inmate, A. A. J., has been placed in custody to carry out the various proceedings and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effect of a Drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear was "deeply pressing on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she was riding on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the center specializing in drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first glance, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was detained around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself for nervous depression.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out treatment of his members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt within the Seville municipal council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to show "transparency" for irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Blood of May", Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a's bold bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD> recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film “Blood of May” will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s literature, José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a assures that with this shoot he has realized "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a film commemorative for the two hundred years of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something that he always accepted when the story took place.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid is a "unique opportunity" for Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a to reproduce with the appropriate decors and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that was mistaken as a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a start" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting filming and to whom he does not do casting, since it seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater to stay informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times an Oscar nominee (he won one), Garcia considers that the three nominee films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of May," "Seven French Billiard Tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Suns," are not representative of the young, well-known, illustrious cinema.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re working only for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garcia said.
Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n gets into the skin of the Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer as well.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to his,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The staging was also made thanks to the musical composition and the guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; to the percussions of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as to the violin of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, who played the role of "who was the companion of".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates her work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n said.
The show will start at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennale
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a newly married Poet" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat de la Triennat Juan-commébia" and the five-year anniversary of the "Triennat de la Triennatre Juan-combia".
In this way, the “Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n” comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition “Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: This People of Light” which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to the different provinces, went to New York.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America would be better off without Paul Newman.
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
He hasn't played since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and the fatherland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He has been the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond had died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He’s set us up,” noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and away from goals.
It’s still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not lack opportunities not to be.
“But why should I eat a hamburger outside my house if I have a steak in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist,” he says.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of a knock-out note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the buttocks, which forces you to go there in advance.
It’s not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there just to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and at the same time cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks of the barracks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to my mind.
So I believe that we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.s.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft introduced a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the company’s campus when asked to).
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognizing shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she is here to visit someone and tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance, but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google’s part to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed as it is the indispensable basis for understanding computer hardware and software.
It does the same job as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your stepmother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who uses half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, cramped months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drinks dispenser, one displays their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the outfit of the Muscular Gay Association.
And if we start to list all his apparitions, we could also mention this mustachu who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple men's cotton jersey, molding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel ' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the most famous body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion business very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I like to walk around the city and watch the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: right?
I think so, but in the end it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very small, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress up for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear clothes, that's when you really get into the character's skin.
All of a sudden, everything is connected.
It wasn’t long ago that you had 30 years ago: has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I was little and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait to see the films 'La ultima hora' and 'En busca de la tomba de Cristo'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't come up on the bridge to do the model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I’ve known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in favor of supporting women and the clothes we display – I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were sold at auction to raise money for the ON.
The people that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
In addition, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of intoxication, or if he is not breathing.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety as well as the Directorate General of Road Safety and the Institut Technologique pour la Sécurité de l'automobile Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of intoxication, resumes the car.
The alkock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one for experimental purposes.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17:40, the official scheduled time, the aircraft of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was about to set, but its rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor so that he could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and at a military rank made up of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very modestly and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before passing into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The Most Prestigious Price in Fashion
There is surely no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family as a nearby table, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH trimmings, which cut the breath, and arm on top, arm under arm with his son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a vest because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pair of pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself into a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets, and she made the good times come back.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another handsome man riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there are no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse when we think of the hectic pace that current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get peace of mind in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run in your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with an episode of a high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (pipping in bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very severe fevers, stressful or overexcitement situations.
In any case, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches ...
In the event that sleep apnea becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children struggling to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepwalkers appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even though he speaks, he sleeps and therefore rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is unusual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because while sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is not a good bad thing, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory on his field after a long period of dissatisfaction.
Without making a big match, the Black and Yellows created the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very sustained during this encounter where the attackers struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting Captain Kauffmann who was scouring the skylight on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the slightly ascent and turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn above, Roman from the end of the foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
Opposite, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the Riahi shaker at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening score for the Illousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illousiens goaltender will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Eleven who just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game where, after a big win, the ball passed very close to the cross-section.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who on Monday greatly disturbed the accesses of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the rise in oil prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le did not stop.
A filter dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel fronts, such as the Sands of Olonne, Vendée, where trawlers remained at docks, or the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday the consequences to be given to the movement and its participation in the planned interview at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let anything go" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
"Butch Cassidy and the Kid" has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner is on board of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that loom over the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth largest aeronautical manufacturer, is maintaining its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, said.
In the first half, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market especially for its aircraft of the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to divest more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
The Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday evening to discuss possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly realise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve has given it at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Analyse Paris Historique de la séance Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of exchanges after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the definitive closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plunged after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives refused the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans have rejected his plan.
“This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late."
“If the project is indeed deadly ... then the relay will be quickly passed on to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution” in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not only an American crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.632 percent from 3.82 percent on Friday night, and the 30-year yield to 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama, winner of the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign CEOs proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that McCain’s performance, though honorable, was not “brilliant” enough to stop his decline in presidential five-week polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% to McCain), said it was the Democrat who pulled his pin from the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them give McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the expected good performance of his sidekick, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She’s got good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seven-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, while underscoring his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>vety” on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he believes he represents the future.
Without disassembling, it turned out to be concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, while Obama, if,” he said, this weekend, a Democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “American on the street.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial misadventure clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy on the brink.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain has set out to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "you noticed that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit they didn’t even vote, “For what it’s worth, since they’ll do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good to foreign observers for the purpose of resumption of language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered proper by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the election commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the debriefing," said Iuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stressed Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive branch.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is that they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore get into the political game because "a dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election, you?" asked Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling station.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcomed their success.
The interview - Blood has become safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained the public’s trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the Acquired Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outrage, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, points out that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease were emerging in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, measures are instituted.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980 was therefore refused.
Now, a few years ago, it was proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, says the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant,” continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
As anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average only accounts for 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
However, anyone in good health who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today’s life is so frantic, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand per year.
We should start proposing them for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - L'Impact en semi-finale
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goals) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series in total goals, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on one side and the other, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the 5-4 semi-final round overall.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - But victorious of Kovalev
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win over the Canadian in the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first period,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation."
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the finished Liberal Party, Jean Charest visited yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of picture mill was projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were shot in a loop.
Big money as in the election period.
In the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but gave no timeline, no investment amounts, no specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: notably hydropower, forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press point.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a line of border that has not been agreed for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Péquist MP from Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place began work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Centrale Beauharnois as the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future,” said Jean Charest.
As a point of press, he invoked another conservative reference to this, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It remains between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his supporters, arousing cheers at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out that his schedule is, however, filled by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ demands in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the Northern Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Péquist leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to implement it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the election that takes place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice in Harper's office, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "sham" for Canada.
Blaming this woman who has waged a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its imprisoned citizen to the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to croup in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are pleading for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that is turning a blind eye to torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” a word that Harper keeps squealing and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist anymore: one can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a hitherto minority head of government (so what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in defamation cases, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the Black Book of Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will wink at the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her vision of the facts to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally held through the exchange of ideas and not by batons.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining company to open its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and dismisses petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of that same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to fat-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag chase (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also just filed a statement in the place of the authors of Black Canada intimidating them).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct attack on academic research freedom and the pursuit of truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies the right to quote from credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree on a deal
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months is yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides for, inter alia: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for lack of payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the executives of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“That’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election have been rather supportive of the agreement, without failing to express their displeasure that we are forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including those aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes and those on the salaries of executives of state-run businesses.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on US television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to digest and that we’re going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky, and unsellable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and bank outflows.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had the first draft of the agreement overturned last week.
It is believed to have come out of this deadlock since Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round out the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the relief companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torment has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing attached to real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that benefits the taxpayers.”
Animator of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to hurry and to carefully examine the path to take," he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up acquiring its competitor in the middle of a shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, one regains a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that times are looking uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government appeared to be nationalizing another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the current loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his card asset, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the charming American actor with a smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensibility and a talent that flowed from the source will also have taken him away from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the glory years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality brand.
For in him was projected a whole country loved by the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who finished second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, paired with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadowy areas of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the splinters of show-business, of which we have not quite penetrated the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has given moviegoers vertigo this weekend, as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a perpetually changing seventh American art is marching through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958, is remembered.
Closer to us (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, reprised after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter billiards player and vengeful in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
And him again.
The times are shaking through its course.
Young people know him best through George Roy Hill’s cult Slap Shot (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several early film legends, Newman would remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendors, and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, slutty or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true pudic sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes pouring yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant features of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drifts are also wiped out.
We will have seen a lot of his binettes throne on jars of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to taste rather bad, albeit gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do well in their invoice factory?
On 8 October, hearings will begin on the ongoing criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damage. Other heads of prosecution have been held against them, for example, false and use of false.
According to the prosecution, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to obtain money from subsidies obtained by issuing fee invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured invoices at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, while they manufactured the stamps at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados, at the request of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to the statement of the latter, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they realized the other invoices that they would introduce, among other things, from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the bill drawn up on behalf of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later be named Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredert, was riddled with errors of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there.
The issuers of bills with an overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. Neither the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért nor that of Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> appeared in their accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that these were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people stayed there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Zealous invoice issuers also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, being part of their choice, but organizing only trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as appeared in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the benefits relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Revf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p on Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért’s order was incorrect, since the company’s services do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The prosecutor’s investigation reveals that the “issuers” also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the issuing company could not exercise, given that its profile was the investment advice.
In addition, it was also for defects of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued on the order of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vesredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont turned out to be false.
As in the case of the Ravenna Bt. company or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Neither did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let was supposed to take a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately Invoiced
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were quite aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k group, has prepared an invoice on the order of the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices on behalf of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association, for an amount of approximately five million euros.
There was no financial movement either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was well avoided by the agencies from mentioning it in their accounts.
The next category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose registered office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, for an amount of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt companies in Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vesredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Mr. Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the founding acts of the companies, he prepared invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecutor’s office thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért filed a grant application with the public utility of the socialist party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for an amount of two times HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from happening, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making invoices, as they had already done in front of the prosecutor's office earlier.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zushi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since applications for his placement in supervised residence, on the basis of a relaxation of his conditions of detention, constantly fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unrepairable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The psychology of over-the-counter: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over-sale of a third, the whole being under the brain stem, called the striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups outperformed one partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and so they made their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group received the 15 dollars before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on one on victory, while the other on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the team members of the players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only through the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
Around the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
One hundred miles are estimated to be the sick carriers of the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. This is due to the fact that often patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through the blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food, in general, accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause of this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to get the virus, because the pathogenic gene subverts the cells of the liver. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of painkiller, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this experience, at least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshock, while each of them was observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university participate.
More precisely, the experiment is carried out as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and scattering electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady in Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first one, was about its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding each other, while watching either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like they were “safe,” like someone who was “taken care of” and they “calm down, and peace has invaded them.”
At the sight of the religious-themed painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided one finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image that they react very positively to, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, all that remains is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we show the believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets as well as the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, this is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, these precisely do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their initial goal that sounded like this: "Let's collect all the information in the world in one system!".
According to the leader of Google interviewed, after ten years of a world-shaking job, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would suit me best?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, on the day when they will know enough about users.
It is not entirely clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search, and the pages consulted by interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can consult what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit to us our pre-recorded statements based on products and services.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can provoke fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke a backlash among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the searched terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court before the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be able to be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose this information.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several months earlier. But ultimately, it failed to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is chastised by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the multinational companies proud of their image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “savages” bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the “connected corporation”, as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as the invader of the world because of Windows, and even if they fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is shooting right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, only the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can connect these to a search system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep their own photos in Flick's gallery.
While we can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, only for the sincere opinions that this can be rewritten on the blog about the whole thing, one can be sure that the whole thing about it is about:
One who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how one can define the principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not a small number. The services of Google online, from the processing of text to the processing of images, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which do not exist and are not connected to our profile.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars).Adwords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasingly large rate, not only from Microsoft to several other news outlets, but from numerous to serious.
However, critical observers find, aside from all this, contradictions having disturbing effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, employee protests, after it has doubled the price of the company's kindergarten and after the company has judged too costly the daily multiple restoration, which Google seems to have taken at any time.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines from Google, so much of the company will be able to build on them.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a stunning way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to clear the trail of <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double homicide
"Police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. According to well-founded suspicions, they have helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," - said the spokesman of the police department department of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the facts that are being blamed on them, and so far they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old man's little daughter.
According to the information of the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes on the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the redemption of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange’s share package.
Ludwig Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of the Poles represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the redemption of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new owner the least good, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent holdings, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse by the day, the leading newspapers of the European press already mention a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster is due to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett put it, it’s more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system increases every day, and thereafter, the whole world will pay a heavy price for it.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat, the one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still extend a lifeline to their shaky financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to make little case for their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - the Viennese daily Der Standard recalled, adding that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is passing through the old continent on its own.
The "saviors" do not have to immediately pay a hundred billion euros, on the other hand it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robot control system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality, looks very much like our safe protective shell - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations department of the brand at the exhibition.
The bee's faceted eye plays a vital role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If not, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee is doing to avoid the other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference can not go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use rotational movement, acceleration as well as deceleration as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, which makes their life longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism must process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for a memory capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant-avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, designed to buy back the banks’ dubious loans, and use them multiple times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that during new debates extending to after midnight on Saturday, the East Coast's local time, congressional leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days, around the $700 billion bailout plan.
“We have taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said it was only a matter of putting the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill, which is in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
In addition, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal that $700 billion be spent on the purchase of dubious credit securities at one time.
From now on, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the passage of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will serve the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase doubtful debts from the banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be the disbursed president.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: it will be able to purchase at the same time doubtful receivables, securities relating to doubtful mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
The department's competent persons stated that the acquisitions can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat provides the tools to address the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large redemption of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or another major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks, who are in a bad position and waiting for the help of the state, can expect that their departure allowances, simply called golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
The salary cap is mentioned only in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys up as part of an auction, they will levy an excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the redemption of the doubtful debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the picture to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only applies to the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in place regarding the appointments of CEOs - said the chairman of the committee in charge of financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pushing for action, as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices have continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to the previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors have only experienced a slight increase of the order of 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with firstly the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with a monthly increase of 2.5 per cent.
The higher level of plastic and chemical raw material prices has resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
Deflation has resulted in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors in the processing industry saw an increase, ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial production, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas set up by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).

In one month, our national payment method has weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it has strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz believes there is a good chance that by January 12th, the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now, everything depends only on the moment when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation".
At all times, it has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations starting today in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailouts
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, assured their support for the government's $700 billion bailout plan, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have concluded agreements in principle on the plan of rescue of the banks.
This funding plan, aimed at defusing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama again managed to get a bit ahead of himself. McCain’s lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colistier just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
“It is now necessary to act, responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We will all have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible path.”
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the cap on senior executives' severance pay, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press magazine of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This epochal change is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely just ten years ago came to an end: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was up 47.7 percent for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", set up in the region in a consistent way by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they have been greatly mistaken about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing region of Bavaria, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of USC voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical, and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it has been the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, baccalaureate holders and graduates.
In these groups, support for CSU fell below 40 percent.

In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that has settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to talk to the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering with its internal affairs.
The populist BZ<0xC3><0x96> party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards see.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is already the case in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or joining the coalition is at the moment a completely open question. These points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as the representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In her message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP of Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children in the most successful way.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil organisations, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Popular Party group, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned that in addition to the distinctions found during hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labor market, first of all, due to their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree."
In addition, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By virtue of their citizenship of the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from a low-quality and sectarian education." - stressed L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In the view of the honourable Member, cooperation by the European Union towards an objective and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of deregulating schools, and compliance with the existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In the name of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, which has been held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, both at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a period of transition
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided in October
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party's president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, can still retain their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, made it feel that they did not hold their seat specifically.
As a result, they worked to appease the angry members of the faction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, there remains only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong stake in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and will be forced into the coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as possible successor to Huber, has also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Liberals of the Liberal Party.
A strange tipping point of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as a putsch opportunity perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then treated without restraint the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, has designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU, which he said deserved much more support from the fraternal party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they re-establish one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not negatively influence the grand coalition of Berlin.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MPs have entered the Belarusian parliament since Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to the illegalities committed when the votes were counted.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been doing very well in opposition for many decades, before the elections yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time, will change his position in the next election.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically more and more dependent on Russia, would thus like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order to the contrary is undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the more expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We took two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was initiated between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this Parliament that has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not plan to protest in the light of the results, rather it is trying to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to print our main opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the right place in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Luk, referring to the fact that the regime does not actually do that.
“Due to the country’s debt and rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, ‘evoking the silence of a cemetery,’ is only a matter of time,” Milinkevich said.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of opposition is only evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never before in the history of the Chigi Palace had there been any turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in force against the little smarts, against whom points and then will drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fainting novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving doors are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” says the Minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been registered, the secretary general assures: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or growing.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
During a conference at the <0xC3><0x89>cole Supérieure de l’Administration publique
In Rome, the minister said that "in three months, the absence of public employees' illness has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more workers in a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make public administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - have doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service today disseminates data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness," writes the Consumers' Association, "the people of 'active idlers' continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration came together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service, the extension of the hours of stay at home of the sick worker, during which control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who are permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures show the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of the Anmil, the National Association of the Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercande.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favour of workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness"
Naturally indignant, everyone has struck a chord to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social severity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed to how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data of the accident victims on the job seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘discount trend’ to translate into less attention, because it’s precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we are not doing enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"More checks and inspections are needed, as is more intervention on the training of workers, and this, at school," Mercandelli said.
- He added - "there is still a need to make an effort in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of labour" and the "derivative of assistance to which the system has been oriented in recent years".
“The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the one who has an accident, should not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislator”
Mp3 player pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unintended and newly identified health risks (Csserseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile phones and mobile devices at full volume may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” Kuneva said.
"According to the scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to educate consumers and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concludes the EU executive-confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now consider with Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from similar portable musical devices and devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and duration.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the money.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - Alemanno points out - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome from which the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council, will be able to use.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have finished its tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is overwhelmed by the day-to-day management and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless organization or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost Roman citizens a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, indeed, "it takes a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass as an independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is truly pitiful: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all state that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross, on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weak point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
U.S., the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly state to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about the credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism such as the general public to hear it, not to be reduced in a consistent way.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six in ten senior executives and print journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web goes.
The biggest publishing houses are braving a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of the newspaper.
The “economic pressure” felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest catch in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to "work safety".
Directors who plan to lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
When it comes to journalists, we are at 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million residents and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or letting go.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “ill” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STANDS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the lawsuit of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
At his trial last week, he was granted a house release that had been converted into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be able to travel from the provincial city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this, noting that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially in the states of the South.
The soul, precisely, that made itself felt in a despotic way with the vote that I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake heralds or already lets go: not only in the United States, but in the entire West, and can be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena covered for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that have, of course, close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families who live in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost here national.
Political internationalization really seems out of the question or has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide any common policy lines.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a fondness for credits: when one goes through a difficult period, there are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no international market or organization can ever dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, when we were convinced that we were now entering the kingdom of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized one thing at a time, that our future will have to pay more and more.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow area.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of alienation that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be always more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and the traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" of the improvised elections or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter of recent times, from the rise of the conservatives in Austria to the rise of the conservatives.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, one would say, are always more difficult, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is potentially intensifying and increasing.
In view of all this, talking about a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes wide open, this is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Overcome the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “is easily detached from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive formed of microfibers like hair, which self-cleans itself from dust during movement over an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Pay attention to the juice of grapefruit, orange and apple.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are desalting and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether they are, in boxes or fresh, if they are associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he raises a new alarm: it is enough to reduce the risk of bruising.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to under-evaluate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink, if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Mezepam.
NOT COMPLETELY- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs one is taking, and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s foreign policy and economic solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that unleashed many controversies, and which was blamed on the economist for years, but which now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a styled “disseminator” who is very aggressive, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to the public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and became less austere, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the standard operating system Apple Mac OS X format, and the latest version of the OS X.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduces the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic design module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphic with the elements of a spreadsheet or text editor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the development of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a comment color for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office next tries the great challenge, being already able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for equivalent video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricci<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's specimens are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait two years for elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of his positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus bursting the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS IS ITALY Racist?
Italy “as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants” welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times is interested in, which has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “Northern Paradox”: the northern regions are both where one records “more integration and more work,” but also “the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern League.”
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope, as well as the President of the Republic, stressed: "Giorgio Napolitano, in his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the state and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the renters' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high global costs that families of origin must bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the general process.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free contracts, unregistered, no rent limit, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza zone, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Belt zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You can save only if you move away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a single, you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for a bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-community students, have a further anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic halls.
Historical cinemas are closing in favor of Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in major Italian urban centers, but also in provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-chambers, and the death of consumption of mono-chambers in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places full of memory, "it's as if one of my friends always disappeared, someone we know is alive, with whom we shared a bit of path and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore the first Oscar of the 20 years ago and the first Oscar of the year.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have mainly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emilia is at the top with 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 additional screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit in favor of merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the planned regulations, there are measures of tax facilities in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking lots and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by implementing other measures.
However, it is obvious that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the panels blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
Heavy accusations are being made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, towards the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little son lawyer, the boss's namesake, already convicted of association of criminals of mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything on a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the willingness to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is an untapped deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have laid eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great rise to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore wave operating systems.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been a true revolutionary step.
Two years from now, more and more of these companies dedicated to traditional energy are relying on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and it is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if one considers that precisely in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are on the path of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears of ecological impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher ecological impact.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the mud to move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six submarine turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the tides rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, deserves at this moment, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and expects investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
