From my point of view, the literature program was formed by women of the Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of the same ladies of the Balzac age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroine of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105<0xD1><0x85>195.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a plate of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts under the body of the sleeping person, preventing the appearance of the effect of "wave" or "gamaka".
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is the coir of coconut.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
An extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and pollution is assigned to a removable jacket case, supplied in a set.
Pair the mattress with an orthopedic pillow – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides – coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

And I cook them deliciously, baking very often just like that.
Germany: The Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine Is Inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
This is what the head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt believes.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in summer, at the latest in autumn," the expert said.
Weigeldt also hopes that the fourth vaccine against the coronavirus will be able to be carried out “in combination with the flu vaccine.”
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, the increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection by the "Omicron" is three times higher than that of the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-strain infection,” BioNTech and Pfizer said in a statement.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on speeding up the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the coronavirus omicron variant.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert said.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for sub-ice fishing, and not just for catching mackerel.
These vibes have more than close in size analogues, a certain weight, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the application of these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and resilient plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing in the scales, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the splitter up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space, crowded by underwater vegetation, crusts and other obstacles, for which it is possible to hook.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant in the winter catch of the navigator and the large octopus, and especially in the middle of winter, when the point and aggressive baiting is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successful Bet-A-Vib is also used for the winter catch of the pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in balance is able to irritate the passive pike, which does not react even to the hedgehog.
When fishing, the Bet-A-Vib bait demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobler is understandable and not capricious, well combined with the forest and braided cords even large diameters.
For catching pike, judaka, ersa or pike in addition to the uniform is relevant and "step", sometimes with "chirkany" at the bottom.
If you are fishing in confined areas, you can change the front tripod to a double one, which will reduce the likelihood of tailings.
Among the lures of its Bet-A-Vib class are among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success can be used both in relatively small and in rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
“At present, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner CHVC in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabiy airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Keeping the Presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner CHVK enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the “Wagners” allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not included in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of lawyers, and its fighters are not in the form lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the 27 EU member states approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
Libya’s Supreme Council of State is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with Islamists dominating it.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the elections of the deputies of the parliament and the head of state from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances of them being held on time are rapidly declining,” the report said.
Against this background, the Libyan Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy in the eyes of the Russians
38% of Russians see more success in the country’s foreign policy than failure, 29% believe that failure prevails.
"The examples of success - "in Syria protected, restored peace there", "the decision on "Nord stream-2"", "the whole world feared that the cool weapons", "Crimea we pushed away".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says the study of the Foundation "Public opinion".
The Government of Dubai has completely renounced paper production - all state services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai has announced the complete abandonment of paper production and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai’s life – we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government,” Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the emirate’s crown prince and chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, said on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all public institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected everything without exception the industry: health care, health care, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and $ 353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry’s performance at the end of 11 months turned out to be worse than last year’s result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were sent for export, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics to last year, then, according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the output of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on granting benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports MIA correspondent "Kazinform".
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year, pursuant to the instructions of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the President of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "About approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans of small and medium-sized entities" was adopted by the President of the Agency of April, 2021.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferrals of loan payments provided for the granting of deferrals of loan payments by banks and microfinance organizations issued before 1 April 2021 to entities of SMEs, including IPs, in the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the subject of the IAS.
In the application of the borrower could be specified a different period of deferral of payments.
During the period of deferral against the borrower, the claim and claim work were suspended, the notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, the banks of the second level received applications for deferral of payments on loans of 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME entities received deferral for the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IMF has submitted applications for the deferral of 131 entities of the IAS, of which the deferral was granted to 95 entities for the amount of 105.8 million tenge," - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain "Okmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "Okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason is to look for in the conditions of the emergence of the virus.
Scientists believe that oxyron was born in the body of an infected HIV or immunodeficiency patient.
That is, during the mutation he did not encounter any resistance from immunity.
This makes it more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, may be more than expected, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate the “okmiron” more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
It turns out that the body’s strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is the case with pneumococcal infections, when the 30-year-old dies, and the 60-year-olds in the form of a sneeze tolerate it.
The immune response of the young man is furious, he is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a gun on a sparrow, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often possible to cope only with the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - it is temperature, weakness, ailment.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain to the right or left, abdominal pain may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia before the end of the year, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years old can begin to vaccinate.
The virologist, the head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten students, - said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of MFTI.

Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of Covid
The authors studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The researchers also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of Covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system’s response.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
The candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheykin named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about the methods of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to orient himself even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, he was a professor at the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGAOU in RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogov, Head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders of the Federal Center of Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to its homeland about 30,000 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the TV channel Al-Hayat the chief inspector of the Department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found in the Museum of the Bible in Washington,” he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Now the Department’s staff is working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, the specialists "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that on return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Auction house Christie's on July 4 held auctions on which bust aged over 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This has caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken out of the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been on sale since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally removed monuments of antiquity at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological searches of "black miners".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases – for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote mode of operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline by which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of the life of Sergei Yesenin - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already outside any literary associations, quarreled with Imaginism, he himself, but is known, in demand, sometimes strongly mocked by critics, even viciously, but the audience is ready to carry it in their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" is completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" is written, 8 books are published, the collection "Rus Sovetskaya".
And the main success - at the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets were so honored, he was the first!
In addition, it offered very good money - under the contract the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
This year’s funding was needed more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange a family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seems to have settled, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" materialized (written in November 1925 and published already after the death of Essenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
Over the empty and uninhabited field,
As I grow up in September,
It fills the brain with alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin strongly gave up, looks bad, clearly ill.
There are more and more repeated generalizations, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich was someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American woman Isedora Duncan was recovering health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again Yesenin will get to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the testimonies of the poet's songs, scandals on this ground, drives to the police are enough - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible novel of the poet with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin settled for a short time with his friend, the imagininist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Esenin, with his very good income, never had his home in Moscow or in Peter, he found himself in apartments, in hotels or at friends.
The Elders remember:
"I came only to sleep, and in most cases in an incapacitated, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o’clock in the morning, Esenin fell on a staircase...
Falling, he scratched his face and whimpered.
When he came to himself for a little while, he began to cough continuously, rubbing the entire sheet with blood.
Yes, Yesenin himself after traveling in Europe and the United States (in the United States there was a dry law, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there, except for the cabanas and the streets.
I'm almost done, and I can't remember people anymore.
Well, and drinking, of course...
I drank because I was sick.”

The father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she had not yet failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school?
She'll have a tail.
So what?

Polish Foreign Ministry Says Belarus Uses Migrants as ‘Weapons’ Against EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry Says Belarus Uses Migrants as 'Weapons'
Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he "is actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union has previously put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It involved 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they are ready to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Shadow of the Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
At the world events of 2021, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first person to announce their new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the film "No time to die" he appeared in a velvety raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket at the Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony that did not match the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic option at an event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend tried itself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm velvet jackets with a lining and trimmed silhouette, the main colors - dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interweaving threads, a dense fabric with a velvety outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you have gathered for a party or a solemn event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It will also be suitable if the invitation includes the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with enough, - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beauty Brammell". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy.
They are simply invited to timed secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a jacket made of velvet with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loffers with brushes, buckles.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in a velvet jacket of a private employee on the corporate, but if we are talking about "manager among those who fills with this event, then - "yes", he has such a thing in the subject.
If the employee ranks lower, and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
This guide will definitely appreciate the phrase "not on the Shadow of the Hat", - believe the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
There are very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural tempest, it's so exhausting.
And it is not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbed, that is, paid.
Billions of investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not on the table - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is wild demand for fuel.
The digger's dripping.
Who's on the fly then?
As usual, a regular buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who “sleep” the energy crisis.
They did their job.

I didn’t see any of the beautiful people in the pictures.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it on the whole car, then they will not fit into it, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful (-its)", but certainly not because of their appearance.

The immunologist said that the revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "omicron "
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"For the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to undertake a revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccines and a booster, or he got sick and got vaccinated, or got vaccinated and got sick, then he got a ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, antibodies are many and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
The “Big 7” warned Russia about “large-scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly,” but the document does not describe specific measures.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s build-up of military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” the statement said.
The ministers further called on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activity,” which U.S. President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious cost in return,” they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine’s restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would be subjected to "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective than Omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the coronavirus omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omikron variety,” said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the impact of the omikron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that an omicron strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality if no additional measures are taken.
Ukraine’s defense minister accuses Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrey Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not wait for the delivery of weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholze.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas, despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, I am sure the diplomat, Germany will keep under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense,” the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany Robert Habek visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

The G7 foreign ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties said in a final statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces near the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the UK government said in a statement on its website.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the EU’s top representative noted that they were “one in their condemnation of Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine.”
Britain’s Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Trass warned at a press conference in Liverpool about the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
We were talking about negotiations in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “recognized their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes.”

Revealed ways to return money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to get back the money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in conversation with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses when entering the data of the bank card in the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used when shopping online.
Some of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can start the refund procedure.
“Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is assigned to the participant in the chain of settlements who does not use this service”, – said the representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases online stores themselves return funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of Safe Internet Ekaterina Mizulina, said that in 2021 alone, 11,000 requests were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances may be to create a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
German Chancellor-elect Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to speak out against Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for the differences.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party are in breach of EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, which was sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the Nord Stream 2 operation in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, take a closer look.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
And in general, there are those who are not familiar with the initial planning.
And I know these apartments very well and I can see perfectly how they were re-planned.
Let them be all right.
It is always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet, window sills, faucets.
You wash them once a year at Easter, or whatever, you have to wash them directly.
Just don't let it get dirty.

There are those citizens who, a week before vaccination, decide to start taking anticoagulants.
And with a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice blood clots.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the reason for the appearance of any symptom.

The money found in the wall of the church plumber will pay 20 thousand dollars
The plumber, who found the money in the wall of a church in Texas, will be paid a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages with money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks that were kept in the church safe went missing.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the term of the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded $5,000 and later received another $20,000 as a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
This is why her attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "she's much richer financially than all the writers," as they write here.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to require a passport covid from the state entering the territory, a decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
From the presentation of the certificate of vaccination, citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are released.
Also included in the list of exceptions are people who have come from countries where the absence of the vaccine is proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists from the coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With internasal use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief prophylactician of the UrFO, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseinov said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.

I've been talking to a bitch (died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to change a warm house, a hammock, affection, love and play for a flowing bitch, then go ahead.

I braked many owners not to run after the dog, although they assumed that out there, 200 thousand run (boxes), directly took his hand and led to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog, who ran somewhere there.
In Europe, the mass protests of opponents of vaccination do not stop
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health authorities’ policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs reading "This is a false pandemic," "I'm not going to get vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightly entertainment establishments.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports of the authorities of a number of regions of the country has been taken against the background of an increase in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then grew into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.

Hello, everybody.
The World Health Organization has discovered an “omicron” already in six dozen countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that a new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain according to preliminary data can bypass the extent of the spread of the Delta strains, the same Indian variant of the coronavirus, which now leads in all countries without exception.
Earlier, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in the UK as well.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “omicron” will push out the “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that the official "micron" at the moment in the Kingdom sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain of "omicron", and at the peak of the hospital will take more than 2,000 people daily.
What the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "omicron" is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
About how the Russian “Sputnik V” reacts to the “omicron” is not yet known – it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

In 2021, the cost of users in applications increased by 25% worldwide, and the number of downloads by 8%.
The most popular in the world were various video services.
Most users downloaded the CapCut video editor, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of downloads of applications and the costs of users in them showed a significant increase in the period from January to November 2021.

"Will such a "return to physical" growth of the application economy be a nuisance? "- the authors of the report believe.
India has become the leader in the number of app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than users with Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all expenses in applications.
Among the applications, the first place in the number of downloads for 2021 was taken by the video editor CapCut.
It is followed by two Indian applications: the MX TakaTak video service and the Meesho online trading application.
The top 10 in the number of downloads also includes Telegram.

People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The industries that have made the most progress have been those that have helped people to be closer both virtually and in person,” said Annie Lexi Sidou, Head of App Marketing Research.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hypercasual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and video production is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world include Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY are among the leading games.
Earlier App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company’s analysts called the growth in the number of users of TikTok to 1.5 billion, the increase in the popularity of generation Z of financial applications, such as applications for investors Robinhood, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

The Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of the company Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger, which is associated with the spread of the means of video communication, are dipfeiks.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using dipfaek, attackers can call the victim’s acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person to be sent for blackmail.
“Such forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a trained attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Head of Varonis system engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I have written above, I have emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow to paint heavily and walk in short skirts, show stockings and pantyhose on legs.
It's a province, but there was such a thing in the store.
In large cities and Muslim women painted, and the beds showed.

Here are five things that can help you avoid diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and of course.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - the decrease in the number of various drinks and the transition to ordinary water positively affect the metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the appearance of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increase the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "weekend migraines" in workaholics
There are several factors that can lead to a deterioration of your well-being over the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working weekdays is often the “weekend migraine”, said the famous endocrinologist, a candidate of medical sciences, a senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MSU, the scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in his telegram-cana.
According to her, especially often suffer from this workaholics, who on the weekend there is a headache, brokenness and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
Over the weekend, our lives change dramatically.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water – heaviness and brokenness.”
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most during the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa have said the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "micron"
In South Africa, said about the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "micron") corresponds to the (level) effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, due to which ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is in doubt, - says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts have clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that an omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other saturated sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black rind), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roscachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said gas imports were losing importance to Germany as the country continued its transition to decarbonising the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
“That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” he said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine’s transportation of Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline "does not comply with the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked into Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legitimate means of payment, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
In the office, Modi was asked to ignore new messages.
The prime minister's representatives said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
India’s prime minister’s page was already hacked in 2020 and has been urged to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the participation rate in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the election.
As these interim results, the France-Presse agency comments, “the outcome of this election left no room for doubt”, as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and “honest” election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates voted in favour of the territory remaining in France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Zemmour said on several occasions.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

Turkey has tested the world’s first drone with laser weapons
Turkey has successfully tested the world’s first laser-powered drone.
UAV "Eren" tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, reports "MIR24".
The device is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance with the help of a laser.
The maximum flight height of the novelty reaches 3 thousand m.
After passing the appropriate tests, the UAV must enter the arms of the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
Turkey is one of six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell’s article in which he described his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and allowed a number of insulting statements to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries “to act as a united front against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," one of the readers told RIA Novosti.
“Europe is not ours to ‘lose’, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine’s sake,” he said.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
The 5.2-magnitude earthquake occurred near the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The target was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start production of new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported on December 11 by the independent adviser of the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like," Dialog.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Earlier, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky said that the country began construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will provide training for personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
At Singapore's Changi airport, lions escaped.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
The two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
It remains to be seen from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed next to it.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of the employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions using drones with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion escaped from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, the people were not harmed.
Experts have warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies have shown that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have folic acid deficiency are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer only increases if you deviate significantly from this figure to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid lumps with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Feyn called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocado, Fine recommended men after 50 years eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April, about 75,000 people could die due to the Omicron strain
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the coronavirus omicron strain in the next five months in England, up to 75,000 people could die if not to tighten restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergencies under the British Cabinet, by April 2022 the country will record at least 25 thousand deaths due to the strain of omikron, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the morbidity, the hospital will take more than 2,000 infected daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent overloading of the National Health Service if the omicron strain becomes more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines will not be able to rule out infection," said mathematician Rosanna Lnard.
The UK’s Health Security Agency has said that if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, about 1 million cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, strains of omicron can become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, there are 1898 cases of infection with the coronavirus omicron strain in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure can already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I read this to this place:

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for the next year beat all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of combating the effects of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for <0xC2><0xA3>50 million and above will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there was no such excitement in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many, who can afford a yacht, are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are carried out at the zum.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, only if their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
“People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, impresses only the number of ordered super-yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 are over 100 metres long.
Norwegian billionaire Rekka is building a REV Ocean yacht with a length of 183 meters.
After landing on the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the sea depths.
In the existing superyachts, the usual sites for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, as, for example, on the yacht of the fighter McGregor - a platform for martial arts.
But it has symbolic significance, considering that the multi-billionaires in the world just over 2000 people.
This is just another example of over-consumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is a thousand times greater than the footprint of the average resident of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the largest polluter on the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint was hidden on his Eclipse yacht with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and have the team take the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don’t elicit sympathy from other people when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been determined, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, in moderately drinking men, the risk of developing bowel cancer is higher than in women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how much four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence develops in animals.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study shows that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can’t play chess or compose poems, they don’t make sense in politics, economics and art, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, according to experts, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine are prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “trade” on Ukraine’s accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "come anywhere."
If you are offered something knowingly unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not trade, but simply send the offerer.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a deal,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
“The training is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to detect and deploy the forces of opposition,” he said.
China encourages the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the Chinese International Exhibition of Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing 2021, held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said a representative of the company Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail vehicle exports, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed.”
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.’s production line produced the first two-story high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will travel on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
The metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s rail equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosian, head of the trade and investment department of China’s International Trade Development Promotion Committee.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment in the world market,” said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system of production of equipment for railway transport, with a full set of auxiliary means and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country is ranked first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist Lists Early Signs of Dementia
The candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheykin in conversation with the radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, reducing the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the vessels of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of dementia will help the study of foreign languages and active communication.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and reasoning logic.
“There are recommendations for the use of various ADIs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community,” said Golosheikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thought,” said Golosheikin.
Earlier, the charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people from the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is called aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the medical council set up by the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nerve rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia,” Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after prison officials subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian policy was quickly able to abolish the punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have been held in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there were protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightly entertainment venues.
Many protestors came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry to entertainment establishments and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for the unvaccinated.
The government introduced the draft laws on a single system of QR codes in the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that the Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities and retail with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transmitted disease, or a medical certificate from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

The Great Rise: How the Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow to collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts, so that all newbies become forever.
However, it is still a long way off.
Games advisor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognizable.
Every winter, more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many of the resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still have to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago from Beijing to Chunli held a high-speed railway, now none of the locals suffer without a job.
The country is opening more and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open food outlets with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become the leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO said.
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed the progress of humanity in terms of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage, which was observed on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they found that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population decreased with immunization, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people have become harder to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has impoverished more than 100 million people, more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Taiwan’s Digital Minister Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Summit for Democracy” was translated into video-free mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
The Reuters news agency, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was singled out in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan has been singled out as green as "free" and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam as red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants of the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
China has not been invited to the Democracy Summit.
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to the “one China” policy pursued by Washington.
One of the agency’s sources said that after the map was displayed, the U.S. National Security Council contacted the State Department furiously, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The “Summit for Democracy” was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which the money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charges".

But how many and when they have children is none of your business until they gather these children to hang on your neck.
And if that is excluded, then what right do you have to condemn them?
Maybe it's just in education like that...
The chosen parents (themselves) dictate their own rules, frankly ignoring the already existing ones.
What if this applies to other areas of life, litigation, etc.?
Laws are not written for them.
What if the father still implements his method of education and education?
It’s a bad example for others.

Those who arrive in cities where land-based checkpoints are located must pass at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test on arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be effective from the date when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of those cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities in which land crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry said about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we have taken with the current administration, with Trump and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the U.S. desire to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated with a nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may be allergic and will need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, correspondent member of the RAS, in the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
Organizing nasal vaccine vaccination sites at airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person after this sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the vaccinated at the laying of the nose snorts after injection.

In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with a new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected per day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the strain “omicron” have been recorded in England, 38 people have a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137 people.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had calculated in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to a coronavirus outbreak caused by the omicron strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries, which impose anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" on the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer on your own,” the Kremlin official said on Russia 1 television.
Peskov claims that this "understands everyone in the world".
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank Herman Gref is confident that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted against independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were cancelled.
Voter turnout on that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago’s inhabitants came to the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the discovery of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live in the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the “omicron” is less dangerous than the “delta”.
The World Health Organization (WHO) previously believed that the omicron was less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines for the disease with the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly modified antigenic profile of the omicron protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than in the "delta", - says the technical report of the WHO.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "micron" in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster "deltas".
In Russia, there are two cases of infection with the omicron strain.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamalei Center said.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former member of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbass.
About it on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <0x3C>...> domestic protests and the government’s confrontation with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)”, – added the former parliament.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - "the war against all".
This forecast will be made in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of the population groups and the president who disagree with Zelensky, because of which it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformating power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is Zelensky’s transformation into the “father of the nation.”
This can lead to some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the ex-deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the data of the survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the upcoming election of the president of Ukraine for Zelensky would give their vote only 21.8%, while for the former president of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Among all those polled, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

The watermelons were monstrous in size.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the bahchi and not before the beginning of August.

The poet arrested for the action in Red Square: "For a quote Yevtushenko gives 10 days, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the HSE was detained in Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetvrossiyamostpoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drafted a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for conducting a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and equally little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police treat you this time and before when you were arrested?

This time, the staff were more correct, the detention as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it sounded in some context of the word.

Researchers have told how potatoes help in the fight against age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body’s systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age disorders.
Due to the high content of the tick, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most benefit, root vegetables are better to stew or cook, rather than fry on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods with a carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only replace imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates removed from Yandex
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, the rights holders of the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated sites of the runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, Director General of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to a regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search edition of both "Yandex" and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of the squid" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service ivi in Russia (included in the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine edition, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (shot in the cinema pirate copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TV channel TNT (included in "Gazprom-media").

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the camera said on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the viability of the Venus clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of the Venus clouds.
Until now, it had been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but probably originally Venus was an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life was born on Earth, "- said the head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Mikheil Paiusalu.

Metauniverse will change Russian business
The meta-universe theme became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the largest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
And so, business in Russia, as in the whole world, will invest in the creation of their own metauniverses and their subsequent monetization.
The metauniverse should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of fragmentation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business’s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go into digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.

You can eat on a spoon, try - and enough.

British Economist Couldn't Predict 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill has not been able to predict 2022, as he believes such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase on goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates based on inflation will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O’Neill noted that amid the pandemic, the continuation of overly soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department “Opening Investment”, said that positive expectations for the dollar’s exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed’s monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But one thing is for sure: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.

The Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent on the purchase of new cars 2 trillion 784 billion rubles, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics of the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
In the related Kia brand Hyundai growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the stronger the dynamics of the trip was only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the sales volume of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of automakers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the three leaders in terms of sales in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - on cars of this brand, the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months, which is 14% more than the year before.
The Japanese follow Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the volume of sales (37%), and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has at the same time a good growth in sales and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity," said Tatiana Arabadji, CEO of NAPI.
At the pace of sales growth, fantastic figures are showing Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
According to the dynamics of income growth, the Russian Lada shows average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand, the Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose sales of cars in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in the negative - in 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of car components and production disruptions that covered the entire world auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AutoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite price lists for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is contributing to this, as well as the desire of automakers to offset past losses, experts believe.
In the context of car shortages, I think that many auto companies have even been able to partly pass on to consumers the costs of past periods that they could not have put into the price of cars before.
says analyst "VTB Capital" on the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think that in financial terms, automakers are feeling very good right now, maintaining a high margin of sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With increasing supply, the possibility of price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow and next year, even if the growth in the cost of the car slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, says an independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes.
The increase in the production of machines is not expected in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold at a higher initial value, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of the invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of an “invasion” of Russia.
President Joe Biden made this statement.
“There has never been such a plan,” the White House chief said, responding to a reporter’s question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 – all those NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow does not intend to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Kiev by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

As shown by the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, in my opinion, you, to put it mildly, are not on the topic.
