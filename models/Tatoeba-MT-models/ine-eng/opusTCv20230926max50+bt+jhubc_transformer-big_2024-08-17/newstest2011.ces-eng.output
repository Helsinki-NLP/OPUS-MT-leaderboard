What does he do? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or a sugar factory
The new city councillors from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-fashioned colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the representative office.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "tried" members of the new council from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they know notoriously established slang, which was created at the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague political cream introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councilors do not understand the familiar terms very much.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a newcomer to Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> responded to the test of the "kmotrovsk" dictionary of the Councillor for Culture.
And even though he was a political veteran, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted in the same way.
Maybe the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression of what you present to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally recognize slang."
From the dictionary, whose terms the daily Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published this June before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriety associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The socialists had to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "bull's neck", "treasure of the capital" and "to raid".
Three of the councilors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who is to head the Prague school in the future - promised at first the interview, but later did not take the phone.
Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, the fifth councillor, immediately refused the test.
“I don’t do these things at all, and I won’t evaluate how well the democrats are enjoying themselves.”
"I am now deciding how we will understand each other within our programs," he said.
As has already been said, the councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would allegedly not recognize in the subtitle above that it is about an influential businessman and friend of the expressionist Bém Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Voldemort" Kauck<0xC3><0xA1> tells him nothing and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, and immediately adds: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf course is then deciphered by the administration not only by matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the environmental councilor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>i Plachém is also aware of where to find this figure - guessing the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery" .
"I think it means going to some Prague company," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is close to dissolving that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k's companies.
Consistent with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, no similar run-in dictionary of slang terms exists.
"I've had a good time with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes we use abbreviations and abbreviations of names," says the president of Prague's <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, who is nicknamed Hulda by foreigners.
"They called me B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>z at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina admits to his nickname.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
Councilman Weinert is for the Grandfather parties or less friendly Grandfather, representative Miroslav Poche, who pointed out to himself before the elections frauds in sponsoring the party, has the nickname "Player" for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only things that social democrats admit in intra-party speech.
According to Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, Huld does not like to hear, but the daily Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Shoe Law" recalls that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", issued a brochure
Women who are declared witches in Burkina Faso have several characteristics in common.
They belong rather to the older generation, they can not get involved in work, for example, for health reasons, they are free and do not have children.
The one who "becomes" a witch is sent into isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"This fate can only be achieved very rarely."
“Even young healthy women don’t give up because they help with work and give birth to children,” says a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of more than a hundred women who have been evicted from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She published an information booklet to help limit the witch hunt.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are unable to read," Die Standard said in a statement.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 27, died last week after being tortured by three women and two men, poured oil and set on fire.
The case was reported by a BBC server.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, an oil was ignited on the woman, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said that he got angry after the group tried to "expel the evil spirit" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 24-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “Eaters of the human soul have always been a danger,” he said.
While the government is trying to calm down the witch hunt in Burkina Faso, the president himself took part in the Gambia last year.
"After his aunt's death, Gambian President Jammi launched a massive hunt for the witches who were supposed to be involved in her death and try to kill the president himself with the help of black magic."
“He enlisted the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president’s personal security force, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Melting in the stones, higher rent signed
The older man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Apartments "uhlobarona" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried the file and in it new leases to three apartments: his, his daughter and his son, who is in execution of the sentence.
All three of them just got hired by deregulation.
Instead of 3500 per month, from next year, the son will pay 4100 crowns for a 2+1 apartment of the second category.
"And there is no hot water and it must be melted with petrama (solid fuel stone, ed.), "the man points out in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which has called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man above it just shakes his hand.
"One says it, the other says it," he mutters.
Ostrava is becoming a major laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, a large majority of apartments that have not yet sold rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at nine in the morning.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a trigger device.
"N<0xC3><0xA1>jem 2011", a special button lights up on his touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number will come out of the machine.
You can't even read the "157" and your number is already beeping on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
It's your turn in half a second.
An older married couple comes to ask about the rent after a while, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern new rents at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems as before - requests for repairs, insurance events, and the like.
Letters with new leases are received in Ostrava by the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio from around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent in their letters.
A special counter for new rentals was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's only in progress," the employee behind the counter replies after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was taken quite loudly by the Vice-President of the Parliament and the Ostrava native Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change the toilet paper," the man said at the beginning.
Most of the time, according to employees, retirees come to make sure they get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the RPG in a special offer.
Half a discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
The Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov "deregulation" counter, but the questions are definitely not overdone.
"Of the 360 clients we had yesterday, there were only about 40 to 50 people for the 2011 lease," the employees behind the counter estimate.
On the web and its boards, the RPG proposes individual contract negotiation where it is needed.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG said on its website.
"There's no one to judge," thinks one of the employees of RPG Apartments, and the man in the street in front of the client center gives her a partial truth.
"I have a 13,000 pension and I have five thousand to eat, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the workers will soon be gone.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent still does not reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, recalls that the negligence of the housing fund by an angry tenant is, according to the owners of the houses, the main reason for the increase.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 the RPG could have invested $4 billion in rentals, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be $5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room repeats several red highlights.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it appears on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, rent will rise by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," the RPG notes.
Next year, the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents jumpy, but will be spread out in four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, mainly to thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They should be given priority by people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a nursery, understood the architects
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, fancy furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
Arch.Design, a project-architectural company whose studios were the source of a number of important Brno buildings, had been counting on space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of the baby boom, and it was important for the women designers and architects to be able to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of shortened periods, the nursery is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of a social program.
Thus, builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding work with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (grant of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and provide qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After exhausting the financial grant (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to run the mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for the grant was significantly assisted by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are cared for all day by a nurse and a school teacher, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, despite the fact that most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of positions in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program load in a mini-school is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and avoid stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
As a result, parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that this creates a naturally loyal relationship between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of an ancient lizard, the staircase resembles a dinosaur’s spine, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of the Art Nouveau art of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The front of the house unfolds dream lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When observing in detail, you can see the geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the brightness of colors is even stronger.
The twisting and twisting of shapes with the same degree also appears in the interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of the door, hooks and bars.
Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place over two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one, but soon adopted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his design board that decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> started Jujol’s successful cooperation with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol took part in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and the G<0xC3><0xBC>ell Park, where Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s other works are located.
From the local house soon after its completion, it earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call it a "calling house".
It is also said that on the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
It may seem bizarre that they have a forty-five degree inclination.
In creating Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a building permit from the city, but the data he provided on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city council was shocked by the result and asked for a correction.
For example, councillors resented the fact that the building interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
The correction never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the call of the city district, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> applied (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a lounge and on the third floor was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The entire six-storey house crosses the stairs, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon door, and a larger company can communicate comfortably together, without at the same time maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction also received an unusual roof and two additional floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are lined with the inner courtyard, and skylights, is also impressive.
The game of two colors adds maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and the most generous apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed at the tours, as they found that it was a very advantageous business and in addition, the tours were extended by common and attic areas, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The suma greatly exceeds the price of entry to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you need to quickly get acquainted with one of the inhabitants of the cottage and visit him directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grid: women have different requirements than men
Not the glorious frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. the mattress and the grid, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be complemented harmoniously in order to suit a particular user.
When choosing a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner decides.
Also important is the type of interior, into which mattresses and grilles are made.
Typical example?
For example, on weekend cottages, where they do not regularly melt, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
However, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don’t have a lot of vents in the core, and they’re still lying on a solid board, they’re holding on to moisture: A mold could also appear underneath them.
The habit also decides the choice.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where a lot of high mattresses are often used with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
“Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they weren’t going to sleep here.”
"On their numb shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lint foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they misread "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers, therefore, years ago, the mattress with linen foam sought.
"Today it's all right, a suitable mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don’t have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate the linen foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you will not turn around at night like after a hard match.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
The linen foam also acts as a protection against bedbugs.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height, add the length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
The man and woman with a height of about 180 cm so need a bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, thus 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, for singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly curled in your elbows," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, a craftsman of the Carpet and Decorators' Guild, who is focusing on the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture.
With a double bed, each needs its own grid and mattress, but here, be careful when buying, to align the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do this with each frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shaping and boiling layer.
"When you touch your hands or touch the mattress, you should definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Full-sized beds, where the mattress and base are like twin beds, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, it is impossible to wash their cover, which is already common today.
And because we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat at night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) mesh.
Even so, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime warranty.
But everything has its ales.
Therefore, practical advice from sellers: do not give up the removable coating for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though today commonly manufactured mattresses are draped all over the circuit, so after opening we get two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), nevertheless the manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when shooting could remind you of the fight of light weight in the ring with.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grate?
Never, ever!
Maximum on a bed intended for one night visits.
However, if the board is no longer equipped with ventilation holes, use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a squeegee layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a base.
For non-positioning lamellae with 14 to 18 lamellae, latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable, but you will always pay for the more lamellae, 28 or more, where lamellae in the beder area are doubled and it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
The positioning lamellar grids do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, because they do not react to positioning.
In addition to the adjustment of the lamella stiffness, the so-called shoulder cradle can also be used.
It is a special attachment of the lamellae, which allows you to push, or even tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper is nicely "scratched".
For men who have "shoulders all over their backs", definitely an important thing.
Even manufacturers of mattresses, who in the "men's" began to use the softening zone in the area of the shoulders, already remember about it.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers, wing or plate racks with so-called multi-torque mating are designed.
The pressure is broken down into several points and the tension is reduced.
However, be careful, as soon as you apply on the right mattress and grate the wrong pillow (big and "padded"), most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips should only intervene on the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should align (along with the shoulder cradle of the grid or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straws filled with grass.
In fact, their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend was also in the mattress.
Raw materials from oil, from which polyurethane foams are produced, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from hops and soybeans.
Soybeans are used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio for mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to relax the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While the man "cools" the plant extract from the birch, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, the women "melt" the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, is thus more breathable than ordinary polyurethane and offers even better elasticity.
By combining different rigidities of cold foams and "linen" foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, thighs and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet the health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as health aids.
He was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic, Gumotex.
Saving on a mattress and a grid is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam embedded in the hood for CZK 11,990.
The second one can be purchased for free.
The era of linden or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density started with the "cosmic" tempo of the Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload during the launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, but in the cold it strengthens.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and optimally distributes its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedbugs, but also for increasing comfort when sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, for example, on special pillows under the feet, which lighten the legs and vascular system.
For example, domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
People's monitoring devices want more and more parents, so they want to look after their children
The fear of owning a child is leading more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally created to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkova.
The device is so far about the size of a box of sirens, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were horrified by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to ask for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spying operation, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example, when they are put in the bag of someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet met with such a case."
"Most of the time, customers are buying it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if a child does not want to wear anything similar, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don’t want to be under control.”
"In the past, high expectations were raised by mobile phones for parents, but they can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of a pre-arranged abduction, the offender will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics with him or her that could reveal his or her location."
"It's a phone now."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will look for them too, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if there is an immediate destruction of the tracking device after an attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to send the location regularly after a certain period of time."
"If it were damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned would be available."
"More expensive devices have built-in tiltometers, so even if a person just slips and remains motionless lying down, the device will immediately send a warning indicating the location," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, a similar service can take even smart mobile phones with navigation, where you just need to upload special software.
The problem with the current monitoring units is that they are either devices similar to the size of a box of sirens or smaller mobile phones.
That's always the risk of losing them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why devices that look like a regular digital watch are now being tested.
"This will have the biggest advantage that a potential attacker may not know the tracking device at all."
"Or she only knows them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are developed into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology used to monitor cars.
It is a combination of location detection via GPS (which uses standard auto-navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords to wrap the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ropes, which are used to launch explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The military has a 225-year supply.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought the incendiary cords from the stock company STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary cords MF DNES, wrote that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of lighters per year during training.
However, according to the army pyrotechnics calculations that MF DNES addressed, all generals, army commanders, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondru and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick are not exempt.
Only in this way could the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of lighters be justified.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's supplies would have been enough for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, it were true that a maximum of two meters of incendiary cords are sufficient for the basic training of each new professional, as experts say, then the army has secured, with a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of engineering or special units - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondr personally that they have almost no ammunition in handguns, so shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It also doesn't bother me that they buy so many lighters from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision, and they know what's going to happen to them."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we try to satisfy as traders," says STV Group business manager Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of cords even by the fact that the army will have the reserves of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from the STV Group only talks about the four-year lifespan of the lighter and the police or army pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four of them," says one of them, who, as a soldier, for criticism of the army, does not want to publish the name.
After the service life has passed, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not threaten the life of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"It cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnicians, who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or here after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this ammunition before the end of its life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and can also more flexibly obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of ropes.
The Ministry of Defence is already facing considerable problems with the elimination of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, the same problem awaits the Czech Republic in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which today "lacino" buys.
To this day, I am drawing from the contacts I have gained through the competition.
The winning place in the Tradesman of the Year competition helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year’s Tradesman of the Year competition was the twenty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like that of a movie.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and with the help of a bank loan he bought a semi-destroyed house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a third-year college student at the time, it was a great courage.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation at the time did not give me to try to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All profits were invested back into the house, which gradually turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, there was another one, just as good.
“We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties about the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting,” says last year’s number one tradesman.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel was very much part of the victory in the competition Trader of the Year," adds Pytloun acknowledgingly.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and I have to say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to anyone who is trying to do something.
You don’t even have to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws from contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten to otherwise.
"With some of the people I met through the competition, I started trading regularly."
According to him, the fame associated with success has affected every employee a little bit.
He has about 70 of them.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them for taking part in something that has gained widespread recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is put forward," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at the Farmet
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the objective knowledge of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind him.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, won the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company competition.
The jury then appreciated the effort, through which he built from a small tool shop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalica a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for the match against the competition," said the winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karl Zdarsky’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for Communist confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his dad founded a company on plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the unprofessional public, the company gained greater awareness after its success in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to perceive Farmet much better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
The past year, however, was not just a sign of euphoria from victory at the Farmet.
The award was based on the company’s economic results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of mechanical goods.
A crisis has been brewing that has not touched the public so much, but companies have already halted their investment projects and started to limit the purchases of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us either."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they managed to keep the company profitable, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
However, what they did not save in the Farmet is an investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training center from the grants, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main award at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It is clear that the crisis is behind them.
Revenues are growing again and so are the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that removes senseless regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial pledge.
Some senseless regulations have already been scrapped.
The infamous winner of the next year’s Absurdite of the Year survey has become the obligation to bring documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
It was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, social security management required a paper statement from the business register, even if an official can obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to the survey, that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register during checks on the insured's payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ.
To highlight all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the nonsense ones to cancel them is the meaning of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is already the fourth part of the business event organized by Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> noviny and is increasingly popular among the public.
If about three thousand voters took part in the vote last year, there were almost four thousand of them already this year.
And it's no wonder, the various legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there is always enough and enough.
"Perhaps we are at the top of the world in the number of tax returns," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can apply for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. Then the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antice" and lets the public vote on it through the internet during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
In this year’s survey, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations were registered that lacked meaning.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees, for example, there was a requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and highways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the competition’s website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, assisted in this culmination of the competition, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws businessmen under their feet, so my goal is to repeal at least three dozen paragraphs every year that today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to break the senseless regulations does not sound in vain.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the booth to the exhibition or tour.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was to report the office of work for its foreign employee on a business trip in the range of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And a third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two walking weights in the office.
This was mitigated this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator dropped.
New Category Appreciates Socially Responsible Companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A new feature in this year’s fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské novin competition is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition, as well as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
To this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of 2010 have applied for companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although the objects of their activities differ diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, affected people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen national finalists, the Prague software company Et Netera, for example, supported the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then took part in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the foundation fund sponsoring disabled children for seventeen years.
An old paper mill from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, which has more than 70 percent of its employees, received the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and was placed third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionately reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prefers to buy from Czech manufacturers, supports civic activities in the surrounding area and saves the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains CEO Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In turn, the responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says company representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of premium bonuses.
"We contribute to food, transport, training and recreation," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
In the category Responsible Company of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by August 15 at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company of the Year."
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone, because it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Police arrested at the Land Fund in Pilsen during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police were arrested in recent days.
The <0xC5><0xBD>el<0xC3><0xAD>zka detectives deployed a local businessman in the media sphere and a real estate trader Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a specific interested party.
He had to pay half a million crowns to Lubos G. for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for a breach of contract in a public contract and in a public competition," said Attorney General Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, adding that further details regarding the ongoing investigation could not be provided.
Sixty-four-year-old businessman was released by police after 24 hours.
The way in which it could influence public competition can only be speculated, given the minimum amount of official information.
A spokesman for the Land Fund Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, when asked by Pr<0xC3><0xA1>va, said that police officers were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen, during a public competition.
"It was about the client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public tender has the correct title "Call to tender for the transfer of land rights under the Land Act" and is held in the event that the interest of more eligible applicants for the offered land is shown.
“These persons, within the framework of the challenge, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land.”
"According to the offered claims, the order of buyers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," explained the spokesman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information about who applied for the challenge, and since he himself is also an eligible person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, offered the interested party the land that he would not participate in the competition.
He must have been collecting the apostates for that.
That would explain why he had such a large amount of money when he was detained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has had superior contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was a figure in the case of former PF boss V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution, on which the decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
Just then, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the access highway to the industrial zone Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole was to be built.
Later, he exchanged them very favorably with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to accede to this, because otherwise, blocking the land would endanger the construction.
Households pay hundreds of dollars a month for housing
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and livestock, heat supplies and somewhere rents will grow.
From January, families will have to withdraw from their wallets up to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and in many places it will also undermine the supply of central heat.
Expensive electricity should cost households in apartments a hundred times more per year than now.
The price of electricity has been reduced by all the main suppliers, so it is to blame for the significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
Gas prices will be slightly higher, but at a time when people are most likely to be melting and thus have the highest consumption.
Every year, there are hundreds of extra crowns to be added.
While electricity and gas are priced across the republic, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, a household in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay an additional 50 crowns per month from January for central heating, and more than 1000 crowns per year for families in Liberec.
Residents of Prague, in turn, are at risk of being more than 9 percent more expensive than water and livestock, if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the rent paid is 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still belong in the whole republic comparison among the lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and livestock prices have risen by 7.4 percent.
For example, there may be a significant increase in the price of rent in 450,000 rental apartments, where the regulation ends in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who will not agree with the new level of rent, intends to put the company in court.
Regulated rents, which are paid by people in about 300,000 apartments, could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, even a better brand of whisky stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which the drink ends up most often in the care of doctors drunk, who were not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated from the monkey repeatedly in the hospital.
This is due to the experience of doctors who meet with similar cases at the admissions of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk.”
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the mayor of the children's department of the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of my dad's closet, it might be whiskey, but otherwise fernet and vodka prevail."
"The vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not feeling so much of it," explained the mayor.
And the spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> also gives him the truth.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a plum that they brought from home," Jurinova said.
According to the mayor of Pelikan, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers at the hospital admissions are a fairly common phenomenon.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances are tied up by schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl in our house about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with an extra 3.5 permilla of blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice for a dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the mayor said.
It is the disinterest of parents, or even their considerable tolerance for intoxicating their own offspring, that is considered the main cause of the growing childish drunkenness.
However, according to experts, dependence in the true sense of the word cannot be talked about in children.
"The term alcoholic refers to a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not the case in children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a symptom of an unspecified family-social background," Prime Minister Pelikan explained.
According to spokesman Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, about forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol by the middle of November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Children who take their parents away after outpatient treatment, or are taken home by the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases when children just sit around the school and drink a bottle of cinnamon, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal fluctuations that you can rely on: the witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either take pity on the wrong confession, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"But I experienced seven children's drunkards at the same time as a witch," Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will start the irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They're actually better at it, because they have a good wake-up call after that beautiful evening experience, and it doesn't hurt them."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelican admitted, adding that sometimes they'll spoil the patients' pleasant mood by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I was directly calculating to the children on the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to earn money for that one party," Pelikan added.
According to him, however, health insurance companies do not have access to recourse procedures in which they would have to pay the costs of treatment for parents in the case of children’s drinkers.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of the five aircraft for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS aircraft is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for training or demonstration years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was still operated by the Czech Army and which was airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159s.
These are so far preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the store - the company Omnipol - took over them last week.
According to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the press department of the defense department, when the aircraft is physically taken out of Vodochod, it is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the exchange were excluded from the long-term storage of aircraft, without additional deposits and investments by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
“The two-seat L-159T1s have been changed in their current state and form,” Pravu Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the EADS has committed to deploying aircraft to certain allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the customer how to implement this thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A few weeks ago, the Spanish government announced that it was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirko Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka.
The Department of Defense did not sign off on the purchase of the tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defense leadership of the time argued that the exchange would support the future export of L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army has bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have a court case as well.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft based on a pan-European tender and not a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at the Prague airport Kbely in fourteen days.
Longer pointer than ring finger means lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed with colleagues in the UK more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
She gave them the same chance of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers.
For those who had a hand longer than a ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men up to 60, it even decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that testosterone supports the growth of prostate cancer.
Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows about this study, but he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer would be "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered with snow, and road users have been driving all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93th kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and personal cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed at the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided at the 93rd kilometer, and the accident caused injuries.
A number of cars also ended up in the pit.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at 185 kilometres in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno at the 190th kilometer or drive across Brno and then drive at the 182nd kilometer on K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are a few kilometers of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague there is a few centimeters of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are created, for example, on Prosek, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also crammed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff will meet again.
Railways and the airport are also in trouble.
The Czech railways had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
For example, there are problems with the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The Ruzyne airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already derailable, but only with increased caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk there are three impassable side roads, in Brno there are places with snow languages and in Blanensk it is necessary to overcome some communications in the above-laid places of the snow chain.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed routes: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
It will be necessary to install cutters in their extension.
It is not yet known when they will be released.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, caution is necessary in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained for the protection of nature only by inert soil, there is a five-centimeter layer of snow, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimetres of snow occurred, with the largest amount of snow falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
U.S. soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The US military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small super-precise gun.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive rift, actually act as small grenades.
Bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit a target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
The top is usually not protected, and when a deadly rain of steel chips falls on it, it can knock it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding a target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, so it gets a precise point of intent, adjusts the direction, and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you press the trigger, the gun will charge and fire the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated.
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July of next year from the existing administrative building on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As announced on Wednesday, the giant in the field that specializes in computers and their maintenance, 400 men and women will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building at Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyonsk<0xC3><0xA1> street, in the part of the city of Frankfurt.
According to a spokesman for Fujistu, another 100 of the Group’s jobs, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and the large space offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only leased.
Competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, “In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), Frankfurt’s chief economic officer, said he had succeeded in getting a “global player”.
It is said to be a "fantastic expression of confidence in this locality".
According to Fujitsu, it is suitable for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed in good time by the management of the company about its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is a matter of avoiding a long non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus Square, which has so far used Fujitsu, and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" were among the most discussed building plans of the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Square.
Between the railway station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entrance, which was criticized both for the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and at the same time for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as a manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which was still connected to Siemens at the time, moved into the home.
Buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu Group in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The office in the Rhine and Mohan regions is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu’s employees are in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with other subsidiaries in this location being Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the starry floor plan, which is twenty years old, is located among others also the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting close.
Amazon has turned off a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a detection platform, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol’s wanted list, is to be abstaining according to one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in a land of the free," activists said in a Twitter post on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, Amazon had downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used the secret diplomatic dispatches of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle a high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: “Fine – we’re going to spend our dollars now by employing people in Europe.”
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers said they were conducting a search, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier release of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting unlawfully, recklessly and recklessly, endangering our national security and endangering life on the planet," the senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should be allowed to help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute the stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
An online activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were also threats.
"There have even been calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson seems to have responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee has asked that a person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, Stephen Harper, a senior adviser to the government, said on television that, ironically, Assange should be “murdered” and Obama could use a “target plane.”
Meanwhile, a verbal spat broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently published spying calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in one person's opinion with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
A special representative of the director of the Center for Counterterrorism, Russell Travers, was appointed by the White House.
Travers has become responsible for developing the “necessary reforms in the structure” that are necessary after the publication of the messages from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to look at ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger due to posting on Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
Z Gelatiere a z Gelataio.
Gelati<0xC3><0xA8>re, a Czech slightly outdated ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio will remove the ice cream from the cooling box with a spatula, rub it into the rim and sell it.
To find out, you do not need to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to learn more about ice cream, the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream maker set up an ice cream university to make sure that the ice cream from its machines matched high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in our own ice cream parlor are also offered for several days.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture into the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars – and a Canadian woman in Julia’s household has come because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the southern and patriot cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a significant dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then turn the machine with a tap and pour pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the assistant professor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you experiment on your own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilizers in the same way - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar seeds.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will eat the ice cream itself.
Certain variations of the basic material are allowed.
It will be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from a white base, which turns eggs into a yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants can take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano will have them always produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the raw material, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn’t have to taste more nutty when it contains more nutty nuts.
The most popular ice cream from kiwi is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
It’s only when a balanced mixture elevates the taste of Gelato properly, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano will remove the device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (winemakers measure the must from grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the instrument for the automatic production of raw material that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we will not avoid small accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo will contaminate himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in the double light
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts at Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Christoph Then, head of test biotech at Munich, said on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts have been contracted by the Ilsi Lobbyists’ Association for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the EFSA’s control regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest.
The EFSA regulations are said to be in full agreement with the Ilsi documents and thus carry an industry manuscript, which should be checked by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a high-ranking EFSA manager with no additions or transition periods to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed a staff link between the EU’s Office of Control and the industrial lobby, sparking interest from both the Environment Ministry and EU MPs.
Meanwhile, EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that currently, genetically modified plants are allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the reaction of genetic plants to the effects of the environment is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize will do in the field,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, then how can they be found?" the prosecutor then asks.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
She has been studying genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected to the concern.
Most studies that are critical to society are not published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck said.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he was standing in front of the train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It says, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one of them was cut, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen to the former ammunition dump of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man is trading in old stones.
He bought everything that was created during the Stuttgart demolition.
"It would be a shame if they crumbled into gravel or disappeared into a landfill," he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a guardhouse.
He says he was being harassed and threatened when, in September, all the newspapers reported that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he talked to the S-21's opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do a demolition at all.
And when this happens, then it is most reasonable to continue to use the stones.
Then about 200 S-21-opponents each took about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope that it will return it during re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the forest, the rest have been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled what went into the trunk and the trailer.
Stones of dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or as edges of pots with herbs.
"This stone isn't really anything special," Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political vacuum."
He sits in his off-road car and takes a ride through his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
A lover of stones.
He's got 40,000 tons of stones in his possession.
He's tying up his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer of old stones in the republic.
The brakes.
In the snow lies artistic sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Marien-Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandman from Elbe, yellow, warm, he's excited.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on the way up through the forest.
It shows the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
Go on.
"Nice travertine."
One time, they belonged to the tribune of Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow there are stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the church of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported using simple wheelbarrows and bull carriages, he becomes completely reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like that happened."
He did not become rich, not very rich at all.
However, the stone merchant today employs 14 people and in addition, on top of the forest settled stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
In due course, he must go to Cologne.
The stones will also be saved.
The battle of talents for high-potentials
There's a lot of people at the dinner table.
16 students are pressed for bread rolls with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most talented graduates in the classrooms, even before they enter the labor market and others will be interested in them.
Because universities don’t issue any lists of their students’ success, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to gain talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department gives out pens, rubber bears and plates with the VW logo.
It tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs, and points them in the right direction.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both parties: “Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience.”
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be suitable as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is that they are fighting so openly for students.
“Otherwise, it was a substantial professional project,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from the long queues of applicants.
On the contrary, it must try and try to attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, graduates of the engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers, the VDI left 40,000 engineering positions vacant in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the so-called shortage of engineers will increase even more.
Roman Dykta is behind the audit and consulting firm KPMG in talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern race for treasure, in which participants have to find a way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me from many interested parties will fly to the USA.
In the battle for High Potentials at universities will pay according to the Dictatorship increasingly harsh laws.
"We want to be different with our Race from the others."
"A one-way boat trip was too little for us."
Dikt's talent hunter seems to be in luck.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar event in the past year."
“Some of them are going to finish their studies soon and are planning to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct on-campus addressing, mainly small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in the labor markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“Like Intersolar,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of the personnel department of solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company’s website.
"Currently, it is difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do a practice or write a diploma thesis."
The solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Large companies often can't offer that," says St<0xC3><0xBC>be's personal head.
When looking for work, money no longer plays a major role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedural options are other decisive factors.
In one study, Solarworld ranked Great Place to Work 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment, and the framework conditions of employees are monitored.
The head of St<0xC3><0xBC>be’s personal department hopes that her placement will bring points to job seekers.
"I think that the interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to be visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil spills
Over the next few years, there will be no new oil wells off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and thus cancelled with final effect the earlier plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new wells are still prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Ahead of the disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The commission of inquiry, commissioned by Obama, is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and strict security regulations.
At the moment, the control authority is fundamentally reforming itself, which has drawn attention to many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil extracted in the bay.
"Government plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the gas and oil industry," the result of a recent survey in the field by the consulting firm BDO - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects are shifting to appeal - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of runaway oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People are living off theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today you will get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian man was watching an attempt to photograph a boy who is brushing his chest with water surrounded by snails: the scene works in a watery glow with ghostly colors almost to pretty.
The fact that beneath the surface floats brown bumps of oil, is not visible.
She used to collect enough shrimp in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-affected areas in the world.
On the way along the river through the mangrove swamps with lots of lateral tributaries, the entire range of the launch is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat cooks instead of light water brown porridge, and whoever dips his hand in the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stick out of the ground like a black stick of licorice, rarely do palm trees let their leaves hang sadly.
We are desperately looking for a flock of birds that are common in humid areas: As soon as the engine stops on the boat, it flares up in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrifying silence.
“What’s happening here is the ecological conduct of the war,” says Celestine Akpobari sadly: “We live in constant fear of health.”
Comparing it to war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battleground where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe enlisted here, here in the 1980s formed the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell concern had to stop producing it in 1993.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni region: while it is daily extracting from the entire delta area three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining wells and 7,000 kilometers of conducting more than two million barrels of black gold, there is an oil field in the Ogoni lade region, for the company the situation is very unstable.
Every few hundred meters, the water of the steel structure sticks out like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are too softly called the heads of drill holes.
They're 50 years old, most to the point of insufferable.
At any moment, such a drill hole head breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant flow of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters of oil have leaked into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea near Alaska in the Exxon Valdez supertanker crash 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell describes sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists speak of the cracking heads of wells and leaky pipes as the main cause.
Shell calls for far less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: Only the number of conduct disorders is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-stained workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by a pipeline, partly arbitrarily scattered across the country, a fire burns: illegal small refineries.
The oil is heated for several hours in a fire pit, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
First it leaks from the line into the catch pot of gasoline, later drops at the end of the kerosene line and finally oil.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four 300-litre barrels a day: “We’ll make 34,000 Naira” – about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta are benefiting from a chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
At a ridiculously low price of 40 cents per liter of oil, illegal producers can still take over: because they have raw materials for free.
It comes from “bunkers” who are piling up for leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are being lost in the entire Niger Delta region every day.
But only a negligible part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally enriched: The largest share will be filled with organized criminal networks, which should include politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the inhabitants caused the disaster and their interventions or the lax mode of production is considered purely academic by the Akpobari activist.
"If oil companies were not considered as invaders and if they did not completely destroy the livelihoods of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries."
In the meantime, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so damaged that it only takes into account the company’s departure: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese will prove to be better.”
Michael's worried.
“It’s high time you disappeared,” says the muscle manufacturer.
"Soldiers can come at any time."
If they are found by a special military unit, they are not threatened with imprisonment, but with a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"The damn thing got our country down to the bottom in all respects," Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines
The A380 has a serious safety issue.
Investigators found a possible construction error while inspecting a machine that had landed in an emergency, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas’ airbus passengers were apparently more fortunate in an emergency landing in early November than has been known to date: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380 aircraft during its investigations – and now warns of a possible construction error.
A possible malfunction could have serious consequences: cracks could be formed on one oil compound due to wear and tear, ATSB said in a statement released on Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is Qantas, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and these damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of the damage a burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered to be sufficiently important for all concerned to be informed.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Snowfall will cause chaos in the transport system
Germany all in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads, chaos reigns, trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people were killed in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures with snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there is up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several highways and many roads there is a very limited traffic.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in use, but could not handle the new snow.
There was also a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a stormy inflow of water 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast in <0xC5><0xA0>lesvik-Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> in the morning.
Snowstorms have caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather station, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland there was a degree of alarm on violets - the highest degree at all.
From the part there came 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused veils.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left overnight.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported major problems on the roads.
On the A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
In Durynsk there were problems due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are great difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Duryn and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken top leads and bends.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the town of Saalfeld, one ICE had to stop in Munich.
165 passengers were given blankets, food and drink by firefighters and rescuers on the train.
The snow blows across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to the snow winds.
According to the spokesperson, the flight information centres have already been reported from Munich cancelled flights.
Frankfurt nach Mohan has been cancelled for 40 years, according to a spokesman for Fraport.
The maintenance of roads is in constant use.
Although there are only a few passengers left without a connection at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light washing, and therefore it will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind is weakening.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds of the strength of the storm.
But it will be a great winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could cost up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now, apparently, the financial group wants the cost of renovations back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, according to the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it makes more sense to own or sell the property and then rent it again," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
According to the data, the energy reconstruction swallowed about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate, according to the newspaper text, the value of the meanwhile renamed towers to "Greentowers" at a price of about 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of the flooded miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has still not been possible to free the dead, because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were knocked down.
In the shaft, where the accident occurred, a probe was launched, but it did not find any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second major detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
He still couldn't free the dead.
Now they honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the monument of the buried miners, on them helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
Flags were flying half-sharks on state government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped the miners would once again emerge from the "depths of the earth" to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants in a memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the basement.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial event.
During the November 19 explosion, British and South African miners were also killed.
Rescuers started by setting fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poisonous gas dissolves, it begins cooling the high temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is it a horror movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old frontiers with his combat epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in a big way with almost supernatural force - it sounds ideal for young men's spectators who are looking for bloody action, because our hero is helping himself with cruel methods of killing his enemies and killing his enemies.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as it is actually called, won’t say a word during the entire movie, and the other characters will utter at most one or two sentences or let themselves be swept away by the excruciating, dying screams.
Otherwise, it remains silent and roams in the stunningly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet shots of the camera.
It’s good when the film has more target groups, it’s just a shame when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically he prevents his works from being either more humorously approached by the mainstream or less brutal artistic audience.
Most of the fans of art cinema seem to be getting discouraged everywhere by the spraying of the brain and the interiors.
Fans of action films will be bored at the latest when the One-Eyed departs for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in the windless and foggy before the crew seems to arrive in America and there.
No wonder, then, that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into cinemas and now it was released only on DVD.
It’s a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the special facade, places up to the convoluted blood, there is an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or precise action, it’s all about the atmosphere, the feverish dream that became the film.
There is no escape for the viewer.
Refn won’t even spare him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his cold shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with an indescribable hatred that roars from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, who helps One-Eyed, keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, who will become time for enemies and transient allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It represents destruction, but perhaps also only for those who are corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Earth Work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a new warning about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is defending its expression - and won't even allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5th and 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), her name appears when it comes to the reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that deviates from the current.
According to a U.S. foreign intelligence release from the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium – from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor might have been before destruction, to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were still submitted photos that showed the building close up or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been running shortly before, but without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, not much is known about it than back then, even the puzzles have grown even larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a “supposed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “valuable.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of the reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat said in the summer, the IAEA had “sufficient material to ask questions.”
The sum of the allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, the IAEA team, led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen, managed to find traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial vendors from the period just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA, via the Member State.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market, because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, he prohibited auditors from conducting a second inspection of al-Kibar and from accessing the wreckage of the bombed building.
Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment on this," the official statement of then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed recently.
The investigation of the case has been ongoing since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as admitted by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA is implementing.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter to be the next three facilities to be “functionally connected” to the alleged reactor – and unlike it, they still exist.
So far, the auditors have not specified which devices are involved, or what function they have, or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was rumored that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be pre-sent to the US to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has the documentation and satellite imagery that material was transported here and there between these three locations and a square near the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one set-up should be “in connection with fuel production.”
There is, however, "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e., enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should later be dropped on a bomb, there are only likely estimates on these central questions.
It is also not known whether the remains, which could hide important traces, are hidden in these three locations.
As if hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the wreckage went.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria checked in 1998 as a suitable repository for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from space, however, show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out ground work on all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damascus, meanwhile, has also rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed, and therefore the matter is not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to control.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspections, has already spoken about "opportunities that I am leaning towards in the future", but he is hesitant.
This election poses a big risk: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens when they don't find anything at all?"
Love in a time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie began working on the still-unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there have been problems.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but it also causes restlessness.
There is persistent talk of the Muslim woman falling in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming moved quickly from Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosniak it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN organization to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, now the Bosnian newspaper reported - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN organization to help refugees.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where the rape took place, the love stories did not go wrong, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims reveals enough about the scenario.
Her organization has recommended to the UN refugee agency that Jolie be released as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed her to shoot after minor delays in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains indefinite.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds quite different: lovers knew each other before the war started and will meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp, where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than "the rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war - it's true.
Jolie argues that it is under pressure that "is not fair and is based on misinformation."
Now she can be freed by the hackers from Hollywood: by illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for the Irish.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates very much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans are cheering for the sound of loud music, butt-footed.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork is hot because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer glasses - and hit each other.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and in addition tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this infamous beer game and a restrained computer scientist, it doesn't quite fit together.
Still, the 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to respond to the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a gambling passion in Las Vegas, going to an interview in New Zealand in January.
"It makes me feel so weird," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job yet."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "Immediately got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: Just like the Tanners, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, experts at the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Sciences in Dublin predict.
It is estimated that there will be 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upsurge, which brought great prosperity to Ireland, discontent is now once again spreading.
The economic crisis is destroying, above all, the young, educated Irish, who have only experienced an upsurge so far.
The loss of jobs and the social decline seemed to be an absurd boom in these years.
Everyone needed it, and the money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland everything goes from the hill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"Please turn the last one off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is only deceiving and offers no prospects for the future to young people.
“They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes her classmates drifting from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labor market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboards in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts so he can pay off a home loan.
“The situation is sometimes really a bit crazy,” he says, as he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I’m not in at all.”
He laughs in despair and walks through the cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, in the driveways parked large expensive cars.
O’Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros – 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,” he says.
He's afraid that it might not go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
A construction engineer doesn't like the complaints he's hearing so often now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave your future open and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He’s also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there’s one more thing that worries him quite a bit these days: his 27th birthday celebration in Dublin.
She's afraid that she might get bogged down at a farewell party.
"Mostly no emotion," he says, and drinks a lot of beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds worrying."
"Let's call it a party of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the entire area.
In this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep drop in output last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, drawing a regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, this is a big increase (Graph 3).
About 34% said they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same figures as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and were enjoying a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and fell again this year to 32 percent.)
However, the mood changes in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luise In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime worsened.
It is only the second time since surveys began that more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Roughly 31% say that they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is down from 38% last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private business is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there supports private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chavez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the field, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders who were trying to help the afflicted country to be afraid.
Elections were filled with ballots and repeated votes, ballots scattered across the channels, broken polling stations, and intimidation.
The polling station is open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged forerunners, shouted out that it was a fraud and called for the election to be called off.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that “in many ways it was a pretty good election.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautiously said that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former first lady, resigned from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is labelled by the election commission for having achieved a decisive battle.
Due to the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were concerns that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
About 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And it is clear that the Haitians are going to do it themselves.
From the top to the center
In the weeks of her sudden widowhood, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the Argentine president, benefits from public sympathy, as her popularity has risen from 20 to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term in next year’s election may depend on whether the bereaved Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez surrenders to the incompromise of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized by Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (at which the government was framed and accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: this year it is likely to grow by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts speak of numbers approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was suffering from an economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction rather than on controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that has stepped in to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on a large devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez announces that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure a debt that Argentina failed to pay back in 2001.
Now, President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is facing a deal with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which he owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be kept under the IMF’s watch, as is usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index that would resemble an introduction to cleaning INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will want to remain in politics after her term ends when her husband is no longer with her.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of a middle class that is tired of Kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation, which they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it is not necessary to quietly deny the many opinions that her husband held in politics.
Half-Encouragement for China
Taiwan’s voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted on November 27 for mayor and city council in five city districts, which may be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that dominate the mainland and have a strong foothold in business relations, including the partially free trade agreement, in the largest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only closely.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three out of five mayor's offices, it failed to win a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors Taiwan’s greater independence, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was in the city councils together with the KMT.
The elections were held like most Taiwanese elections, which included noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags of sparsely dressed girls.
There was even a mysterious attempt to assassinate him.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot Mr. Lien across the face, wounded him, and killed the spectator.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates squabbled over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the Beijing government.
But this time the DPP also abandoned the incitement of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realization that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue with commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but first and foremost.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP party has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a bully and a supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has developed that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called up as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who was in charge of the office under Mr. Chen.
Their side is now doing everything it can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be outraged by this move.
In a statement released from his cell, he said DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be fighting for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the sluggish pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go campaigning with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganize his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Nominated for the Grammy Award: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speaking at the request of the president and the people must be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is hailed as one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with nominations in the Best New Artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the rules of the Grammy, when the artist is not allowed to release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hand behind the elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success, which in 2003 recorded the last single for Norah Jones.
Elsewhere, Grammy jurors rightfully praise the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing run of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positotly."
Trombone Shorty, a whimsical New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" has been awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise fond of the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk has won several well-deserved accolades in the category of large ensembles, where the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the ever-courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" has created a beautiful example of how a rock can have a base.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Nominations for classical music at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" are nominated for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California appeared the Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The Classic Music Producer of the Year category has five nominees, which include Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; the "Sacred Art" from the "Sacred Artifice" from the -
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchantedera" from the BBC; and "The National Choster" from "The Enchantedra" from the BBC.
Composers nominated for Grammys for contemporary songs include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
About 30 minutes of the play is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and the "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performances by the soloist with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who was performing at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle East tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony while recording the works of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the transition category of the classics, she received the nomination of soprano Jessy Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula gained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project, saying it promotes terrorism and will lead to a halt to trade.
However, the jury decided Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews you will remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"Opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against are only shouting loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The talks began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly divided, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We are Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families lived in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented with the filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a space of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand out from the main elements that have been considered so far and fundamental.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not proof that it’s some form of truly ‘alien’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report that appeared Thursday in the online edition of Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
“You’ll start to wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for searching for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report about this novelty published to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to utilize other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, Vel.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiology Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that the microbe that is exposed to the two elements may be able to replace one by the other.
“Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus.”
"The result is that organisms can find it very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which are bacteria able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better at the action of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with the replacement of arsenic, the possibility increases that a form of life that uses arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example to prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that earlier forms of life might have used it.
"This suggests there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from the Bellflower motel were found, the Los Angeles area sheriff said on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and the Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say where exactly the dogs were found, at what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We're following the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not spotted to comment on the case.
They were very happy when on Wednesday afternoon their two akitas found themselves in a shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old Trace dog and a 10-month-old female Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi breeds Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to compete this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop away on an almost monthly dog show trip for a couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a boxer's puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton hound - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the car at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would introduce them to missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to cry again now that the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start all over again.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York federal insolvency judge on Thursday officially blessed a “pre-packaged” creditors plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
With Thursday’s announcement that the plan meets U.S. competition law requirements, MGM has no legal hurdles to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the studio’s chief executives.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees to a $500 million loan to fund new MGM operations and production.
Now it is a merger with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to settle their finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and a turnaround expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s and 140 studio creditors’ financial difficulties took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay US$2 billion plus the finance demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from the competition in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect for their services, which run the company, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to contribute to the funding of two films, with the book "Hobit" as a template, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, has been seeking a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beaded whistles or about 48 Play-Doh glasses.
However, there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law works; this year’s tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, than in previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with associated websites have emerged, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the number of toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one press, the animal releases a tone and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start moaning, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years)
Last year I borrowed a 14-inch animatronic doll from Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel lock.
Children test the Mickey's toy as a dance instructor, although their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80’s kid, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quizzes cards, which are designed to turn a car into a fun work with a self-made, funny workbook.
If you are shipping by smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for kids 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest easy-to-use option, with qwerty keyboards, although games don't have as effective a tutorial as Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids 3 to 12 years old), the first significant change in Leapster's range from Leapfrog, with newer and clearer.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90, for kids ages 3 to 7) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.

The introduction of finer police checks in China
As an urban military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checking his orders, and issuing orders out of hand with military authority.
He wanted the female members – the Chinese strong-willed enforcers of the urban order, feared and despised for their harsh actions and fondness for violence – to convey a certain impression of the noises of those around them.
"Stand straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to the rule.
The four headgears fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said contemptuously.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new brahmins to have a college education.
The province of Guangdong has changed its grey-green uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced stark looks with strong weapons: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers surrounded the wagon with snacks and stared at the owner until the salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 residents in Chengdu, chose the operation as its main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police force with 13 women who have been selected specifically for their appearance, propriety and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also the softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media usually captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat an uninvolved viewer to death after he used his mobile phone to shoot as they began their anti-junk protest operation.
Last year, police training was held in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, the manual described how to effectively beat offenders without signs of blood.
This year, a basement melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left part of his brain.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows Chinese police officers attacking a street vendor.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
There was a "really thorough cleaning" on the paper.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised an interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The period demanded female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is mentally too demanding for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if on government websites.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes a series of nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district town, disagrees strongly with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for proportionate facial features.
This means that the issue of good looks is the subject of debate among the Chinese.
The disability or the mutilation certainly does not apply.
"He can't allow a crooked man or a hunched man to serve us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is keeping watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her looks could have a sexist look, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the streets where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, a group stands up against more than ten merchants who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the marketer began to run, and for a time left his bicycle with a cart of noodles.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than laborious.
“Every day is basically the same,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority as their male counterparts to confiscate goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after fake news spread that police officers killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police seized the motorcycle, which was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the car could cry as he wished.
15 minute distance in front of the policeman, facing furiously, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the men's group, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in maintaining and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said objectively.
"Most of the time it's the public that starts it."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the Justice Department have cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, lawyers told the senator on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign’s office said he was “certainly pleased” with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigations.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer the subject of the investigation and that there are no plans to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with him.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so much do the documents and interviews state.
Since Hampton had been Mr. Ensign's assistant until recently, he was barred from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to contradict the prohibition of lobbying.
The evidence that was published "appears to be a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign’s case, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said the department was cautious about political charges after a large number of failures, including last year’s decision to suspend the defendant’s lawsuit against him.
Federal prosecutors “clearly concealed the weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically indicates that the laws don't apply to high-ranking government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that he was called by the DOJ’s attorney general on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the DOJ had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the plaintiffs to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in Wednesday's statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had submitted to the State Prosecutors.
"I'm not happy to compare the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which the ethics group alleges that the payment of Ensign's parents to the Hamptons of $96,000 violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that had long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started working as a lobbyist in the company, the head of Mr. Ensign's staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "kicked" the Ministry of the Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of an investigation into the crime, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them in the courtroom.
A minute after a minute, the news of the terrible testimony was sent through Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, more than 140,000 tweets were about raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, a retrial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, was held, and there was to be an official end to the death penalty that the jury voted for.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by mainstream reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate infiltration of information with outrageous details then introduced the jury into the decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom would also be required.
“As I have experienced with this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom will affect the rights of the individual to a fair trial,” Thomas J. Ullmann, Hayes’ chief counsel, said in a statement.
The judge in the case, Jon C. Blue, of the state’s Supreme Court, briefly rejected the allegations regarding the proceeds from last week, saying the media had been “carefully vetted” and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the Sheppard versus Maxwell case, the media trial was a "carnival atmosphere".
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes’s judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be needed to determine how to communicate from the courtroom, which was a non-representative in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
“There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it had been carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtrooms may make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined lawyers of Mr. Hayes who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
For example, the defendants argue that in Mr. Hayes’ case, there may be a bias when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of terror when choosing a jury.
Some of the judges said they were appalled by the photos of the victims, which became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defendants claim that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury that was critical of prosecutors and that by his decision he wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to a verdict last month that the case dominated the Connecticut news and was discussed during an election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly stirring up the flames of emotion in the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter’s impact is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more infuriating than the reports mentioned later, and in their view, the judicial police should be in charge of the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers have called for courts of appeal with the often-used arguments that social and technological change requires the courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in Dr. Sheppard’s case, due to the breadth of the proceedings, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard versus Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of politeness appeared this week in Washington.
Is this the first pillar of real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusive moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not bring any major breakthroughs on key issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party-polling.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close co-operation has built mutual respect for several months that transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a testing period - probing each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's hearing and its subsequent evaluation of participants was also conducted with minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it’s a matter of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed,” Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, told the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The elections stirred the emotions of the parties, and then they were silenced.
It's good."
On a number of issues, particularly those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cut at the end of the year has expired and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a likely compromise on unemployment benefits is only because Republicans can’t look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed reject unemployment support.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
“After the things that need to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term,” he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism – which is largely widespread – that courtesy will lead to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the creation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of overestimation, knowing that they must act on their promises and have to cut government spending and repeal a new health care law.
These attachment lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes, increasing the retirement age, and reducing spending.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, developed pressure on the deficit issue to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The biggest opposition is among elected officials in the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, little basis or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will start next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to solve the budget, taxes and health care, which will be followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the bias in the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could go to the bottom, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely watching the public’s reactions.
Anyone who threatens to cut the vote will likely change course and seek compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
The bias and alignment is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would have been welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents portray Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city’s governance is in the hands of “kleptocracy” and it continues to pay some of the bribes and protections that come its way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of office” – will take its own when the money begins to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when he was still mayor of Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in cleanliness.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and won several lawsuits for wrongful charges for such accusations.
In September, he said on Russian television when asked about a proven evidence of corruption: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s bullshit.”
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up for voting.
It is, however, unusual to see such details expressed in this way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The Moscow city government and its association with criminal elements led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government functions more as a kleptocrat than a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city.
"Analysts have identified a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Department of the Interior and Militia are in second grade."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill vacancies in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "The business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course."
The record says that while the selection of money is complex, the protection itself may already have difficulties; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
For those who don’t pay fast enough, their trades close under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no more political classes.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without the separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (the country is ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening certainly did not elicit enthusiasm from the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks had released could have been fakes and reacted angrily to a statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the whole matter is that it is about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a sparsely lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "butcher" for his cruelty during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander of this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges, and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalties are also shattered in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims of the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and its former soldiers to children.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court jointly handed down the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the sentence of a former leader, notoriously violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest grew among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samph in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically recall the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people had little benefit from capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
“They are surrounded by the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
"There was an upbringing without any idea of carrying out the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok enjoyed them all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make sure of everything."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Earlier next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the lead offenders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from field work to her wooden cottage on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there's another criminal prosecution, there's going to be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court sought more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia needs to dig a deep hole and bury its past," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms means gluing broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and is titled "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains fewer than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, even young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complicated and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and courts are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains is a weed-covered road littered with discarded plastic bags that leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned in a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the edge of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she will bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees it seems its stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergey Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and appeared to have hit a rock in the past spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, several covert operations have been conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, as it is a sensitive matter.
The deal proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was ousted.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... We're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,” which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Non-Proliferation this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium to be used in the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, seek to remove its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, and the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make treasures with the years of the CIA
The Spanish government has not made any jewels regarding the CIA flights transporting the imprisoned Taliban and members of Al-Qaeda to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo through Spanish territory, the United States envoy in Madrid said in a telegram.
This follows from documents provided by the WikiLeaks server to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is also written that the then first deputy of Prime Minister Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show that he has a proper air traffic controller".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing dozens of states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The prime minister's spokeswoman said the Council of Europe's statement "has taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights of secret services over its territory.
"They simply want to be informed so that they are not caught unprepared," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also hinted to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the lowest possible outlines of the matter, but that the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Attorney General Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he did not intend to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassified documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information," the embassy said in an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concerns over "obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than declassified information from the CNI or the Department of Defense.
“This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the luncheon of the U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, the ambassador told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", the instructions had already been given to the co-sponsor.
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech: Lidov<0xC3><0xA1> strana - czech: People's Party - czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech: czech:
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to exploit any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or intentionally ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if such disclosures may have negative consequences.”
Admitted mother-murderer complained to the network about maternal "anxiety"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her own blog: "Terror in Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname, which she used from a young age, communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
To be able to understand them, it is necessary to know the emotional life of a woman, which the newspaper ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan T<0xC3><0xBA>nez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they separated, she found out that she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You've just made a new acquaintance.
Her choice was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their co-existence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palmyra.
However, from the content of her communication, it is evident that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is someone angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good, but now he realizes he has to be with the little one all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address where I can send your baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll take it when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until the 19th, because the 20th I have to go for work so I don't lose that place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be, with me, and never again in his life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," she said.
There is another post in July.
When he taps this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he's quite fond of it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school there, so I'll save some money for the nanny."
The Seventeenth Greetings and Complaint.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how he wants, he'll meet with me, sex is needed."
Thirty-second message: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There is also a report about Victor, the current partner: "He gives me money".
On the Internet there are M<0xC3><0xB3>nica's posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept calling herself "Muki's ex-prisoner."
"Terror in Galician (motto)".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything would happen because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention centre in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "didn't intend to hurt the little one in any way."
Before that, however, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in a bathtub and had put his body in a suitcase.
Both the defense and the prosecutor request a psychiatric examination.
The people would have won 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would have lost 9 seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP could have the main say at the councils in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - see below) already has an idea about the general elections, whether there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, even if the number of elections is very small.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this trend of increase, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, is maintained, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to be held, the PPC could gain 12 MPs in the House compared to the current 8, the party of the CiU (Convergence and the Uni<0xC3><0xB3>n).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would have lost one member - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would still have one mandate, or would have gained another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the closest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist rule in the four main provincial cities and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona), which is one of the millions of administrations with the highest pre-emption of the euro.
Both nationalists and peoples agree on the possibility that the PSC could lose city halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona assembly - as a minimum of 5% of the vote must be obtained.
The PP party has increased the number of votes won in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled jointly with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, PP won only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
People also gained in other important towns such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has representation at 34 councillors in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell grants thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda, among which were also "Tigers of Liberation of Tamil-speaking people" at the time.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure, with the help of "Operation Kampai", the weakening of the Al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "to limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that within two years of being active in Catalonia, the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then falsified and then delivered to groups that make up the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy, so that their “warriors” could continue to travel across the country unpunished.
This broken cell was not the only active one that had a jihadist network in Europe, and therefore, in addition to Thai services, other European police forces also participated in these investigations, and it cannot be excluded that in the following days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another developed in Thailand, with Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Atihar and P.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole tourist passports that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, must have been valid for several years and must not have been issued with visas.
The investigative documents stress that so far no facts are known that would link the detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Thailand and then faked in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency about a thousand dollars, which were "invested" to buy cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands that Massa stop the fiscal deal
The President of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camachov<0xC3><0xA1> had the opportunity to personally present to Artur Mas his conditions, under which he is willing to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are the same as those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy.
The president of the Catalan people came to a meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in the elections last Sunday, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, therefore the candidate of the CiU needs to at least one of the formations of the formations of the formations of the formations of the formations.
The possible alignment with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists in the House would like to keep until general elections are held, but so far, the talks that Mas is having these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried in a Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to win her support for her appointment, "he will have to put an end to all the sovereign and liberation speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque country - which the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the outdated political apparatus of self-government and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the appointment of Maso will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today meets with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility says the deaths were not caused by "lack of measures"
The Olot Center’s shows do not rule out the fact that their caretaker killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution of criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a carer who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala arrived accompanied by a lawyer of the institution, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "at the request of the home La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "lawfulness and responsibility oblige us to abandon this process".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer due to the failure to detect the criminal activities of the carer in time, the great threat to the home of La Caritat are now claims for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the clients of the nursing home with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything was handled on the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through her director, resolutely rejected this extreme, stressing that "the lack of action could in no way be the cause of what happened".
Attorney La Caritat added that "in the case, there is no indication that any third party, other than the defendant himself, would make a mistake."
The man, now known as the "Angel of Death," confessed to 11 murders yesterday and clarified that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later killed the second grandmother.
in this case, he caused death by taking too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of tranquilizer tablets.
The director of La Caritat said that it is complicated to control the access of staff to drugs.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably in six of the nine cases the caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve them of suffering.
However, only analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is not lying and was actually looking for his first victims less cruel death or on the contrary killed them by the use of leech, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe the doctor’s claims, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he admitted to, and they justify their behavior in different versions, which Vila submitted to the court with the knowledge that he must change his actions when it was revealed that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full extent of the matter.
The European Central Bank is under threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday's threat from the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal differentials closed with force and the shares of the European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose interest.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it would take the liquidity rate back today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy back public debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted "at least by March" and to follow a three-month open-access bidding by the end of this quarter, thus guaranteeing liquidity at least by June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and even announce its intensification.
If it does not meet the expectations it will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to draw the rate of liquidity, God is with us!
The same was true at the May convention, where they claimed they hadn’t even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets – tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored fist announced it on Monday and on Wednesday said it had already bought many of them, causing further market collapses.
Yesterday’s one-year tender exchange in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
As a result, Portugal's rates fell by 30 points, reflecting the market mood change that occurred in the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, published figures represent the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million on short-term securities and another potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem was not revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the new budget approved by parliament and still doesn’t have enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in her face for the next EU summit on 14 December, at which a political compromise must be reached that would show that we are a union and that we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - in the ears of investors it sounds like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond tender, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be in great demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would close our sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not only to be, but also to appear".
We can do it.
President of the Eulen Group will challenge the actions of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the family of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, is inconclusive.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the group’s founder, will challenge El Enebro’s planned 16th of this month legal action, demanding five of his seven descendants to whom they should try to impose their majority and seize power with the help of the company’s administrative authorities.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José fine-tune the legal team for the new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of the company.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem to be willing to settle his dispute about membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
Five of its seven descendants were removed from its administrative committee, who appointed themselves as superiors during the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The proceedings of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the official of the No. 2 Commercial Court in Madrid, renewed the roaring in the womb of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
An appeal to a judge is, until the dispute is resolved, the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's Mezquirizov considers David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving with the help of a trial and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the conduct of January 18, which was completely invalid".
This argumentation will serve as a basis for justifying a legal attack on this act as "absolutely insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to summon the court in June of the hearing.
in El Enebro, a group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to the family protocols, the founder of the group requires a right of use for 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when rehearsing the issue of judicial review of proceedings. The date of this rehearsing has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests improvements in the vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the chances of this newly arrived team too seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wishing to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 - the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him the winner.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating the marches that the German company put on the market in 2007 for the purposes of a very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software tool, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants, and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements “within a few hours, in almost real time”, which are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements over a single period.
Today, the Red Bull team is working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyze and propose each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be translated from virtual reality into reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit on this technical ability is the $40 million maximum that any Formula 1 team can spend on each season to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art technology plant around 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings, which are limited to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that is going on here is considered a "great secret".
The list of participants of this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is, without a doubt, the new champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immense technological means that the brand of energy drinks has invested in its participation in racing circuits, there are other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, and at the same time no one knows them.
Steve Nevey, head of manufacturing technology, said five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was thanks to the drivers.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth 85% success, while the pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 of its own stores in two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Spanish HP Vice President Helena Herrer cited as an example a newly remodeled store in Barcelona’s Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working with for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP's personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here with the exclusive design of the equipment stores (with products that can be tried interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in the provision of personnel for business.
Helena Herrerov<0xC3><0xA1> denied that it would be franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in the purchase, maintenance, after-sales service and even packaging".
The Barcelona trade is part of a world-class pilot pioneering programme that aims to address potential problems with computer equipment under warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We will be able to solve problems in 10 minutes, which otherwise can take up to two days."
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service,” said Helena Herrer.
Sabadell to ‘steal’ a million customers in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell’s delegated board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it is expected to reduce interest rates, but they will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to get one million private clients in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years and be able to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to apply for public assistance in FROB, to gain market share by attracting a million new private clients - or 700,000, respectively, if those who may leave the bank are deducted - since until now the institution has not been able to cater to small and medium-sized enterprises.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private clients is 3.5%, while for corporate clients it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or one might say sobriety, in order to reduce costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
In fact, he believes that the path out of the crisis in Spain "will be a long one".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that the passive war – which reduces margins – is retreating, the price of premiums for the risk that banks and savings banks are paying for their issues to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, compensating for the reduction in margins.
“The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans.”
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is to reduce commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater sizes will be required".
"There will be no stone left on the stone next year," he said.
It confirms that the needs of capital are “much reduced” and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions enter among the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can supplement the collection of funds in the market before new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it cannot be spent, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of merger savers
The Director-General of the CECA yesterday rejected the idea of creating another wave of mergers, and again insisted on the speed at which the sector is being reorganised.
When he started the process of assembling Spanish savers, there were several institutions that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are the conventions."
"Most of it is completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already done and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well in this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Chief Executive Officers of Aragon - see translation) Olavarrieta expressed that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it turns out in the payments that have been made in his time, not now, in circulation.
Moving from 45 savers with an average asset volume of $28,000 million to $17 million to $75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that they are larger and therefore in line with the Treaty of Basel.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process" that show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on time before the end of the year".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "lack of knowledge" to those who doubt it.
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savers, as well as a system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and that continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had done very well in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, from reducing taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, until after the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - note.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgadov<0xC3><0xA1>, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to start the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future will be, which runs counter to the idea of adhering to the old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of these is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to March – although now it may seem like a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for the guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time now, so there is no room for slurs now.
First, when in 2009 the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission instigated deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (plans of fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The latter was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel was painfully delaying the decision to rescue Greece.
It has already been the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear position when she demanded to reform the European Union's conventions so as to allow the rescue of a Member State while at the same time giving private creditors the obligation to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat tempered, has been approved, and in the coming months we should be following the Union's reform process, which should allow for these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although there is now a need to take measures with which it seems to disagree too much, the old functioning of the euro will end from this date.
The year 2013 will see the birth of a new currency zone, in which violators of the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare a deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany suggests to us that we must take a strict path of growth with an increase in the rate of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on receivables and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed in the years of Spain’s booming growth, they simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It’s not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we could be wrong.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us until spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the path has opened up to the idea that things need to be put right.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and breaking the rules
Finty, as shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax, show the wit not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramose) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be written on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behavior, and whether UEFA should possibly bribe both players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won) the named players one by one deliberately lost time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in their group at the head - and will be able, stripped of the cards, to proceed to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee awarded coach José Mourinho a two-game penalty and the guilty players received a fine.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten, but follow each other.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which in its anthem boasts nobility and honor, and which has already punished its players for similar acts), and also, it seems, due to the dramatization led by Mourinho, which adds to its long history of comedy.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these facts circumvent the law; in fact, it is an action respecting sports rules, the meaning of which, of course, seems to be trying.
It is decided what type of damage such actions cause to the sports spirit.
One of the requirements of sports behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these things that characterize a clean game is to avoid allowing players to have an advantage over an opponent's team due to their offense - which is also not the case here.
So the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that what we normally characterize as a gesture or circumvention of the law did not happen, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as obvious as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The next question, however, is what advantage will the perpetrators of their intentional offense have.
It should be noted here that the opponent does not get into a disadvantageous position and that there is no benefit in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition, with this action, the players will be penalized, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which it is enough to exclude one card less than in the first round.
So as the rounds continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between making a joke and breaking the rules is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was definitely a joke.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions to provoke them from the leadership were transmitted.
The violation of sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
The battle of offers to organize Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year, the Dictatorship Calendar concentrates the avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Just like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, Christmas parties are coming again, the sector still acts as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in the fight to get customers by reducing prices: almost all want to spend 30 euros on food, they want to associate this with the euro.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated requests for the week from December 13, creating a avalanche of bookings for the days at the top (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees pay for the expense of parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of portability, says the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of restaurants does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think it through before they make a reservation."
"They want to get out, but when it comes to pricing, they're careful," he adds.
The shops will do well for those “who will offer quality and good service at a favorable price”, he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down the ladder and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest rush of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most requirements being for spending up to 30 euros, which was adjusted by the menu offered, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another important company, which is Andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar more early reservations, since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to maintain last year's prices, and our menu, which should be chosen by everyone, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and has a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after recording an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
Sources of this company emphasize that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 or more, as they recorded a tendency to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - see translation).
They also noted that companies are already popping up, inviting their employees again, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings has "revived" although clients "negotiate to the maximum".
This impression did not fade even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who paid, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest in Washington that is fuelling Pakistan’s nuclear program.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of communications and the ideas of North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, the documents do not reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, rather than increasing it, "is on the verge of retreat", and that it does not "restore" it.
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored in pieces to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before the visit of the then National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transporters".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the program of guided missiles is no longer only observed by the United States, but also by Russia, as a reason to be vigilant.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strict religious belief to protect its nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or missile-controlled programs," said Yuri Korolev, an expert on U.S. missile defense.
The biggest new piece of documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the ever-lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the issue of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
A dispatch issued by the embassy in May, which classified communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” said: “Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected.”
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, noted that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to “make it very clear” that “the Pakistani army must end its silent support for terrorist groups” during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani’s army chief.
He is the head of Wikileaks.
Obama appoints a high-ranking counterterrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issued a “red call” to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol has announced an "extraordinary call" to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but it is dated to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with accusations of sexual abuse facing Australians in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, a lawyer for WikiLeaks, said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.
It was on 20 November, when the international police corps based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose a temporary link on him and issue him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, nevertheless consider the so-called red notice to be an enabling arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially if the States are involved.
The move has been deplored by Assenge’s lawyers, who published the letter yesterday, claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," the letter reads.
While the whole world is looking for him – and his mother is defending her son’s innocence from Australia – Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he provided an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview, he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations and thus violate international conventions that the United States signed, she should step down,” he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual running the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding to Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the foreign ministry to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations “to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who would financially contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, stating that Assange should "be killed", which he subsequently had to recall.
"Obama should write a reward on him or use a drone or something."
The one who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for leaking the information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," he told Fox News.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s looking for peace in ERC by "sparking" on the adherent Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to secretly vote on its permanence.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe to fight the already several internal revolts in the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) series, unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party leader is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Caroda-Roviry, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot make them as concerned as he was with them.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms by means of blinking, which will help him turn to the municipal elections.
First, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to speak out secretly about his stay in office.
By voting cards, not by raising your hand.
If Caroda’s supporters want to hand over a criminal vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the split and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added without specifying the percentage that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - which they consider a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the largest organ at the congresses.
But given that they don’t have enough majority to enforce resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
To this end, they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, which the management will vote on on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>se in return for promising to move the Congress as early as the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader said that “multiple voice” is damaging stability and that his goal is to make sure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
in this context, it seems to be a distinctive article, which the current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s's ideologist, this innovation advisor took for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he called the five, and two of them stood out.
The first is the "recomposition" of the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means also to include new faces who are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second goal can be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should end entirely with the assembly as a functioning mechanism.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that it is possible to hold congresses through delegates chosen by vote.
The termination of the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has fought in this direction already at the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 Crohn's Assembly decided that the assembly must be judged at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has been a distraction from the resolution of the matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to re-examine the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed per month in November; 390 per year in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico saw a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the daily MILENIO.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the previous month of the year, there were a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out the finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a stroke to the head, and her hands and feet were tied with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n Colony, in Naucalpan County.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, the team discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by probably the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a fifty-year-old man was killed by eight gunshots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were shot in the head in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, and under the body was found a cartridge of a .25 caliber weapon.
in Ecatepec were found parts of the human body in the sewer of sewage in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
The rescuers did a thorough search for other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlan reported the body was found with their hands tied behind them and their heads wrapped around the Pena Colorada site.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the trunk of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in Atizapan de Zaragoza district was reported, and there were also reports of death threats among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the district of Los Reyes La Paz.
In the nearby colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, a dead man was found wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which had been preliminarily identified by a report that he had killed.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with no signs of life with two stab wounds in her buttocks.
On the skin of the woman was discovered the tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - note. translated) and also necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a body of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found, and a report was also found among them, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the case of the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying post-torture scars and had bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first was shrugged and found in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a tape and had a message with him; the second was tortured and found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China is pursuing its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
A representative of the country at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said that it remains on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at the United Nations climate change conference, said.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million over the past four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he said that China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that China’s strategy on climate change is divided into four elements: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
They have already made progress on all these points, including last year’s approval of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
Further, he said, various multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, as he said, a Programme for the efficient use of energy, which has been implemented over the last five years, and which has received investment from the United Nations, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s climate change expert, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020.
Espin’s legal exclusion: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, Czech: N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> ak<0xC3><0xAD>pn<0xC3><0xAD> p<0xC3><0xA1>nta - czech: N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> ak<0xC3><0xAD>pn<0xC3><0xAD> p<0xC3><0xA1>nta) stated that the former Chairman of this party is entitled to claim his rights from the National Order Commission.
The national president of the PAN party, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legal and that the former president of this party is entitled to appeal to the National Commission for the Order and to demand his rights.
In an interview that was taken before the objection was raised by the state governor Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Standing Committee in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Standing Committee of the National Council, in his case, for a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she was never at the negotiating table for the Alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
“This is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a local election intent that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue are on his side, and therefore "we do not suffer from internal competitiveness, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said the committee could, without debate, elect the best president or chairwoman the PAN deserves for the next three years, so he would hand over the relay to "whom the committee appoints".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will proudly hand over the office of the party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last elections in July will be reflected in future pledges, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now we need to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances of Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloe, will represent a flag and will be the object of observation throughout the country, since "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will stand by them".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party) for his speeches over the four years that he has been in power, César Nava urged the PRI members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Sal<0xC3><0xAD>l de <0xC3><0x89>rnas and Carlos Zestas.
"If the PRI believes that the Zedilla and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Clader<0xC3><0xB3>n governments, let them start defending them, let them get out of their way," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive branch has the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, since the country does not use a handkerchief or censorship.
Obama to pass law to support undocumented students on Twitter
“If you think the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama has joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize undocumented students, with a post on his personal Twitter account.
“If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an online link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to immediately connect with senators as a vote on this bill approaches.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report came after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless it was approved to extend the Bush-era tax cuts and fund the government.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believes that once the fiscal issue is resolved, it will be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of the other matters," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act, so that a proposal to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
The U.S. Senate approval of the Dream Act would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, who have resided in the country for the past five years, and who have been admitted to a higher education institution or to the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organizations of its supporters carry out intense agitation to ensure the passage of this law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida senator George Lemieux, who supplemented Senator Mel Martinez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John Mccain, has not yet spoken.
Although the House of Representatives will lean towards a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature put your finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la laga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is similar to the Czech "to hit the nail on the head - note. transcl.)
The second round of the Pleasures of Language cycle was a walk where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... A finger in the morning? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuelov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was invited to start the second round of the Pleasures of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used as a counterpoint to the question.
The finger in the morning "brings us into the narrow", said the Argentine writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to listen to this debate at the round table, moderated by Luez<0xC3><0xAD> Monteluz and Mariz Monteuzu.
Luisa Valenzuelov<0xC3><0xA1> read the text she dedicated to Gonzalez Celori, which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa acted in the first person as the protagonist, who in search of knowledge of the "wound" goes from the doctor to the doctor, from whom she does not get an answer, although she does.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents the really exposed and the symbolic scar."
The protagonist sighed slightly and came to the conclusion that "she managed to learn so much about the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and fears in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguz Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also performed with a delightful story he called Praise for Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with the elements of magical realism tells of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back the people who have gone far, or repaired the honesty that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning, the protagonist did not miss the words of his own chronicler.
“Cervantes, who invented all of us, laughed at the fake testimony that was presented as real in the stories, but in other ways he never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery that he even lacked shame.”
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and it is precisely where reality and lies come together, where it is no longer known what of the story belongs to one group and what of the other, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is what he calls the “Cervantian tradition.”
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her word Finger in the morning allowed.
The Cuban-Portuguese writer has pointed to a major blow to the social violence that is going on in her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
“I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise that is not intended, of course,” she said after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and a dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader – and in their “chemical reaction.”
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer committed by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which overlaps dogmatisms, he forgets that "behind every touch there is a little no and behind every denial there is also a little yes".
"In order to be masters of our thoughts and realities we must color: and color means many times to put a finger into the wound and annoy those individuals who are much more comfortable, for they think in caricatures, in black-and-white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also to annoy the authorities."
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but has already managed to achieve on three occasions to the decisive series.
in the duel Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, they will encounter two different styles distinguished by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he has experienced both good and bad during his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has gone undefeated, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team in the next final.
The Santistis strategist, as a coach, made his way to his first Apertura 2002 final when he had Morelia's win, with which he conceded a total of 4–2 against Toluca; then, in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he again advanced to a decisive duel and also lost it with an overall score of 3–1, which was against Rayados.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluca, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Uzen<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>" (other nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note.) after 2 minutes of play, after 210 minutes of play, he did not lose.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him it is the most important institution.
“I want to come out as a winner, I don’t want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I am committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first is the most important,” he said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
"We've learned a lot," he said, "and we've learned that until the referee writes the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for the action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to celebrate, we were ready to celebrate."
He's not worried that they might decide this series in a penalty shootout, he trusts his players: "We've never tried to get to a penalty shootout, we've tried to finish in normal time, but sometimes there's no other option and we have to be prepared for that, we've been in the last round, we've been in the last round
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the second and taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
U.S. changes visa rules
People will have to contact the Visa Service Centres before they can be interviewed at the Consular Section; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Visa Service Centres (abbreviated as ASC) before an interview at the Consular Section.
The staff of the ASC will collect the biometric information of the applicant and these will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay the fee for arranging the meeting, the second for processing the application and another for delivering the document by transport service.
The applicant will pay only one fee, which will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and fingerprints will be taken from them.
Given that biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview at the Consular Department will spend a shorter time there than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the service of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakdown in the search for alien life.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA Headquarters in Washington.
When it invited journalists, NASA assured that it would introduce "a discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for alien life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and that could represent the possibility that one of them will become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that has been considered too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The arsenic creature somehow uses it for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that "there is another form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true scope of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explore Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n produce opposition "block"
Reforms to the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of “bipartisanship,” they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term had not yet begun, when the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the MPs of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tica, Czech "Party of the Democratic Revolution" - note.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Party of the Work" - note.
Before the beginning of the session at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo "humbled" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, "bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, PRD party coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council led by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Briton from the PAN (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n, Czech for "National Action Party" - see Vice-Chairman) and Luis C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas vec<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality at the behest of the parties PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He clarified that in the coming days, they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
“When the [opposition coalition] came here, I look at it because we’re excluded from any decision, they’re not even willing to consider the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n, and therefore they will form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duplicative".
The aspiration of the reform of the law is not to have infinite bipartisanship in Congress.
The group begins with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that at the moment Congress has become the "use" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"Before it was controlled by only one side, today it is divided by two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the MP, to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order that the five of us, who are probably already nine, but are now seeing us in five, are not left out because of the bent agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed, we have not been able to do, and we have not been able to do so."
Another 200 thousand pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n will pay another check to the disputed owner of the company supplying electrical equipment.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the mayor to Lorena Guadalupe Camacha Palazuelos.
Thus, the amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying electrical equipment climbs to 1.2 million pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, it was issued at the amount of 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject was stated "compensation of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, another amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent in favor of Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, it's just what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although so far this entrepreneur has not been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the suppliers of the town hall again.
In the past, after 25 July, the newspaper Noroeste published a review of the cheques issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the city of Camach paid <0xC5><0xA0>ezuelos more than 42 million pesos.
It also executed transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites are in urgent need of maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada site in Mazatlan.
After the fall of the foreign tourist into the depths of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboady site, the tourist sector in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to pay attention to the impression of the destination, and the bad thing that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the revenue they’re missing, otherwise they wouldn’t be dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the downfall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just correcting existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because as citizens we deserve a clean home, the city hall should change its maintenance strategy."
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer - see translation).
“Today, in order to attract tourists, it is not only important to promote, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city abounding in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out,” he said.
"The necessary attention has not been paid here and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
Speaking about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, undersecretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces that will need to be put in order first to attract these places and to be able to put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination.
IP calls for congressional results
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CCE, would like Members to take on a great deal of responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state faces.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and no agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlan, because Sinaloa is thrown into convulsions and faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has started, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that will not be repeated by the same party and paternalistic patrons.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), has proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on great responsibility and set an example on the way to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect MPs to really exercise their right, without any agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival processions of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary obstacles that would move the ruling party forward in order.
“We want them to do decent work and be primarily committed to society and sectors, because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them confidence in the last election.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in order to achieve the country’s economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which in some ways will support job creation."
As for tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investments that, moreover, directly compete with agriculture."
In addition to spending money on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help deliver security to the state and help with an alcohol bill that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
The Three Kings are looking for
Dolls, cars and bicycles are, along with other toys, on the wish list of children in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the coming holiday of the Three Kings to fulfill their ideas, since their household counts exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because the husband is not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with "plebeians" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuelova Andrade, the mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, Cayetana would have wanted clothes the size of a year.
“He said to me, ‘I wish I had this monster car,’ but I said, ‘We’ll see my son,’ because it was very expensive,” recalls Cayetana’s grief.
For older children who were just in school, it would be ideal clothes and shoes.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, who is 11, is 12 years old, the 10-year-old Isaiah is 10 years old and the eight-year-old Miguel is 8 years old.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing sneakers, so he could use a pair of sizes five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and bring a gift or money in cash at the reception of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers who were arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours were held in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly at sites used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 acres of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom were alleged bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to arrive at the courthouse in Sherbrooke after their arrest.
They could face charges of manufacturing Indian cannabis, possessing it for the purpose of trading it, conspiring and stealing, among others.
These inspections were subsequently carried out after a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests," Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional investigation department of the city of Estrie, the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Administration.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will apparently be defeated, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I am very much in favour of the Charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as it is proposed, a law that would allow any person coming from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NPD’s critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the mainstay of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition.
“Canadians are telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada by storm and treat it as if it were some kind of patholysis.”
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to an election leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI agency that the government would ask for a vote so that any MP who opposes it would respond from his position in front of his voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to make sure that this idea is not forgotten: Québec plans to consult with the Department of Investigation of New York on this issue as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise to many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on October 29, last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, there was no need for public safety critic, PQ Party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "amateur solution stuffed on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing at a public hearing.
"Furthermore, Mr. Charest is determined that he does not want to set up this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior State Officials.
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed that Quebec grant special powers to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, which they allow to force people to testify.
Creating a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also post-Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to make it better suited for this type of criminal activity.
This request would be based on the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Public Security Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his fellow justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to the memo.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected a group of bikers, although the Penal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Law on Gangsters.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall, which has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been pre-emptively evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The road's been cleared.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rains, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hit the most.
It could drop as much as 100 millimeters.
If we add up these collisions with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Rivers to the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in les Laurentides, and in Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, became subject to flood emergency and continuous control.
In the de Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re area, heavy rainfall caused the drainage of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be preemptively evacuated.
In Outaouais, the discharge of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is on alert and is monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a flood warning on Wednesday for several rivers, most notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly blamed
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to rude speech during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians of rude statements that he does not respond to".
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council received a number of complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Social Support Joint Front.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, the moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of 'Dupont's midday news' have come across the delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no blame placed on him.
The last dispute concerned the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media shootout that provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he had not sent any donation to help the Haitians, because we cannot know with certainty that the necessary money will actually be received.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative picture of Haitians.
"I've already put off my three-day postponement of the thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross language in broadcasting.
In any case, the radio broadcast CHOI-FM cooperated "beyond its responsibilities".
For the station, which will, among other things, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of kung fu in Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special period.
An athlete who excels in “sand” (kung-fu “full contact”), kickboxing and Thai boxing, he enters the tatami and rings of the whole world and is looking for new challenges.
“I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for matches all over the place, because for those who don’t like the game on the ground that comes with martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The opponents who finished first four in the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"Interestingly, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this year or beyond!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's a bit of an equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-final winners will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will fight to be crowned the only champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million contracts without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed to $450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed from the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project in the total amount of 295 million dollars without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was authorised in 2004 in conjunction with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for the management of this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public competition.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies puts before us a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and provokes price increases.
"It's a new way to realize collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people no longer make side deals in secret, they are doing them openly today," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says that it is hard to bear how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon, objected, strongly denying that this contract was about collusion.
"I have my own way," she murmured, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "missed accuracy."
She said that "it would be the least" to apologize to PQ.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice all over the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the scale of the work.
The construction is already underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, a consortium formula in the field of engineering consulting is the subject of investigation in the government.
If we fly through the business register of Quebec companies at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created by a constant.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Concerning the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that makes us cringe at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and there are few bidders, your bid prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: that is, to pick up the people who figure in that contract as contestants, and that you say, 'Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and at a good price.'
"But the main idea is that the important thing is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Party of Quebec.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devoir, he counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin has accumulated 22 contracts, of which Genivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
Together, they charge $449,783,344, including a contract with Energie gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known Liberal Parties of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has released a report that PQ is also linked to the companies that “finance” her, before clarifying that it is more about her managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not encourage confidence
More green, but overtly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in the "unbiased" brands and eco-certificates, to be guided by this when choosing products.
The worst thing is that even when we bathe in the media universe, which urges us and urges us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe complains of a lack of reliable information, of non-fulfillment of obligations, which it even qualifies as a brake on its first commitment, the Bar<0xC5><0xBE>e<0xC5><0xA1> says.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who are trying to sell them still don’t trust them very much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t believe companies’ environmental promises, simply because green advertising by companies is finding a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labeled as environmentally responsible, says Barometer.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be a priority for the stimulation of this page of consumption revived currently by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and the dubious nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Barometer has identified, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the population of Quebec relies untrustworthyly on the stated data about the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More “green” and responsible – the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year – Homo consumus Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to minimize its impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental consciences apparently remained somewhere outside their car, the Barometer notes: In 2010, just 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and cycling also supported the 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company Angus et le Parallele, which sought a $7 million gift from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and demonstrated its mission as a lover of cinematic art, did not get what it wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government is proposing a loan, the amount of which would otherwise be lower, some of the original expectations, which could lay the groundwork for a viable solution under favorable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
Quebec's first action plan and $12.8 million demand were already rejected last spring, but requests for cuts have already been revised.
The proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallele et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centers in Quebec was opposed to direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, assuming that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion, on the other hand, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the theaters of his cinemas during ten years of film art after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which could be the reason for the change on the part of the financial council of the state.
The lack of halls for independent films is excruciating in Montreal, and eXcentris has been able to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will spend $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallele, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and to project the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and so he is ignored, he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are made to him.
Lifting the curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new US diplomatic sources familiar with WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but by the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
U.S. diplomats, therefore, marvel that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
In addition, four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, exposed to public scrutiny yesterday, provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The announcement of September 22, 2008, in the midst of an election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian inferiority complex, almost stagnant, requires perhaps political leaders to talk about internal bets, rather than realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
“The United States is, therefore,” he concluded, “the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" to the extent that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It makes sense that the ability of a candidate, party, or even better the party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls.”
Other expressions of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa <0xC3><0xA0> Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s continued confidence in the early February vote of confidence on the federal budget, which Canada publicly acknowledges its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese wrote.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties are subject to their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington’s attention to the increasingly negative picture that the United States throws at dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe not too subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, if Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the principle of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it reads, "some paper was handed over concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the Secretary of State."
"The secretary accepted that she was going to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
Mike Huckabee was also heard in the United States.
World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to restore home lighting, trade and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect (GHG) limit, which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional limit that needs to be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from 2020 to now.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the United Nations wants to push in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement commitments to reduction on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the planet's greenhouse gas emissions.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from a car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, a large country with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to achieve a stabilisation of climate warming at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out that it will not get out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption by two more times.
Fluo-compact bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which he put into production this week by Philips - this company allegedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the incandescent bulb, giving us an idea of the potential savings with a replacement plan that would be 100 times more expensive.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent lamps because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless producers set up a collection system.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants, which emit many of the mercury needed to produce electricity lost in the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation per year.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion dollars.
The Ivory Coast is impatiently awaiting the results of the elections.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate release of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results," a spokesman for the U.N. president said.
"It calls on all parties in Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results have been announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission let the deadline - Wednesday midnight - expire, without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission was "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the Constitutional Council’s cancellation of the “misleading” vote in the north administered by former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup d’état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the intimidation maneuvers practiced by the UN (New Army) in the north of the country had deterred supporters of President Ivory Coast from going to the polls.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from sending out the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was seen as a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who won public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France in terms of the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas regions), according to provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stood at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed for 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are out of work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks’ time to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of today’s young people in the labour market has risen further with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.
As for seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is 482,000 people over 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 had the benefit of unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after accounting for 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged and put in prison.
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste management companies and brother of PS Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly inadvertently.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of abusing the company's assets, abusing public funds and public assets, concealing, providing bribes, receiving bribes in order to influence the office and holding the ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, and not some delusions."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a lot of criminal reasons, but it's another thing to prove them," Florence Rault, his lawyer, told AFP.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew about anything like this, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was accused on Wednesday of abuse of public funds and plots, and left free, under judicial supervision, to face the ban, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to provide an explanation of all the facts that are being blamed on him."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and leaves him free," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
Four other people were charged and released on Tuesday night on Wednesday, with two of them being under judicial review, said Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for accepting bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two Aubagne officials, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "the alienation and misuse of the company's assets", the other for "the plot to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini’s business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “hiding the misuse of the company’s assets.”
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a concurrent case of fraudulent public contracts relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped launder money from a large-scale gang.
The investigation is conducted within the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the city community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysian palace exaggerates Syria mediation
Over the course of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for “espionage,” unified views in France, introduced diplomacy to combat readiness, and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this has been closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the downsides of the crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of expatriates).
They show how senior French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian jailed in France and wanted by the U.S. justice for subversive material dealings in favor of the Iranian program.
Finally, they expose the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing for it.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran: French comments on the way to resolve the hostage situation".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, an adviser from the Elysee Palace for Strategic Affairs, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay’s Director for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with Allegrone, the head of U.S. diplomacy.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to get him transported back to the homeland of his own nationals by force detained in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "continually pronounced" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring to the trouble an Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more, the more they will ask you to stop it."
Since there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “masters of avoidance maneuvers.”
Mr Richier recalls that the detention of foreigners is “Iranian family tactics: taking hostages for the purposes of ‘political blackmail’.”
He announces that the release of Klotild Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day when she will be granted asylum by the French embassy) "will require payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (a deposit of 230,000 euros).
And it will announce that the Elysee Palace is anticipating cases of hostages, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
"In the future, the Iranians could arrest another 1,800 French people living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss has already left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Iran’s Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims was expelled for illegally trading electronic material sensitive to Iran, is set free in Paris on the basis of a judge’s ruling.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material intended for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France agree to the treaty?
The liberation of the Iranians for the liberation of the young French?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he said, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision" but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There have been talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under “limited” surveillance by the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysee Palace dials a phone number, hangs up the phone, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian is currently in a Paris building run by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss’s imprisonment in Iran, the Elysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through a communique and organized “escapes” to the media, to convince Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to play a “significant” and “influential” role as “mediator”.
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The 25 August 2009 telegram evokes a media "blessing" from French officials.
What is the basis of such a level of "gratitude" expressed towards Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only vague notions of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication “is aimed at validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” it said.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "demonstrate to Syria what praisers can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to “sow the seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysee Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
South Korea’s government will pass a law called “Pecival,” which will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, responsible government officials said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministry's lead official who is in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, a responsible employee added.
It also provides free programs to people who request it, allowing you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in the world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
FIFA World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspected corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday set up the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, a choice that is politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk surpassing technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the Royal FIFA competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to deploy to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will participate within the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the political economist.
Negotiating behind the scenes faces the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to FIFA’s assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too weighty for the 22 members of the executive committee in the hour appointed for the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the start of the revelations leading to the suspension of two members of the EC /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have destroyed the chances of their country, the cradle of kicking, which has so far hosted the world championship only once, a year.
The BBC put the crown on it on Monday when it aired a document that "pinned on a pin" three influential members of the EC (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to Make FIFA Dissatisfied and Lead the Troubled English Leader with David Cameron in the First Line
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move made by his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win for London the organization of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair Spain-Portugal are not missing trumps already prepared stadiums,his well-being (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move the championship to Zurich and has publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in remarks barely translated into accusations of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
For 2022, they seem to be the logical favorite of the United States with their considerable experience from 1994.
The world’s highest-performing economy, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, seems to have a big head start ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have put together a beautiful project.
But these candidatures appear to be premature for the two countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa fervently wishes, has rendered the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could be angry about the sluggish TV fees (due to a time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Obvious (Security)
De Gaulle hesitated.
Mitterand raised the impression that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysee Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But apparently it is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if doubts are constantly persisting.
In one sense and in the other.
In 2006, unbelievably, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims that the third term should not be ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "it will be decided sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminded members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the prospect of a "two-mandate" has sown little fever.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement, not a notification.
This is not the first time that such meetings have evoked the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years ahead of you," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His statements yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to candidacy for PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal's flask, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to organize into combat formations rather prematurely than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and we do not discuss the matter with the UMP," the people from the immediate vicinity of the Prime Minister reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, settled with the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Central Board of Governors of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for withdrawal from the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt obliges, the Institute for the issuance of securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already so tense in European securities markets today.
In this case, the political price would be higher.
On the occasion of the press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of resolving the debt crisis of European states.
She didn’t want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I commend my consideration for my European partners (...) ".
The evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he was satisfied that he had stated that the program of "buying sovereign bonds" at a secondary glance "would be
The only certainty is that the European Central Bank will keep its base constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, bond purchases from the Central European Bank’s cash register have doubled in the last week to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And thanks to the illogical nature of the market, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the market participants that there is an anticipation of the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the exchange rate.
If the loan operations have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank for more than three months, the latter bank shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquidity on generous terms and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in any meaningful way."
“If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering short-term new tensions,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms adds that the European Central Bank would have to maintain the purchase volume of its bonds in order to revive the soft market.
In view of the exposures of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the bursting of the paid performances of the states among the most fragile," the important bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will be more concerned about reducing their debt than stabilizing it.
It is the saving of the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government backs off
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation eased a bit, yesterday with a 10-year return on bond interest.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions said that they had heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as "unsolvable" and that he was expecting an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) flew up to 263 points, which caused some disruption in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the deviation from German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "rogue market developments" and a possible infection originating from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and weak fiscal inflows, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and at 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public finance deficit will represent a further 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new set of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Directors under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OCDE.
There is also the issue of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and then the elections to be held at the end of March could begin.
This would start a period that would be unsuited for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think the Europeans demonstrated it on Sunday all day and all night, they are obviously very committed to solidarity, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion, concerning interest rates on European government bonds, has brought water to the mills of governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can not yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's notation office has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt record, a target that is mostly focused on by various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, mainly based on banking systems," said economists Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is running slower than market time.”
Conscious of this broken connection and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, who are most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their counterparts from the G20, are progressing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin Group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Fund (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, on Tuesday denounced Singapore’s trip to Asia in order to inform Far Eastern investors about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this journey is not to increase funds, it certainly prepares the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issue of the EFSF’s securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, the US official told Reuters that the United States will support any increase in mobilized funds through additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict measures with a rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid took a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs even before they apply their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their permanent confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-access the stock of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the very first plan of trading with European sovereign debt, believe that an addition of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance to be tried in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have an orange alert.
Snow allocations are still causing traffic problems, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts now have an orange alert due to the risk of snow and frost.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and la Vienne, joined 20 districts that already have a declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes, and weak snow on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowstorms are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, some districts banned the passage of heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is, according to police, very difficult and the police recommend to go out with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are foreseen to restrict the transport of goods.
The district office "calls on all car drivers to exercise the greatest possible caution on the roads and to adapt the driving to the nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services should contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport to Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been pouring in.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we are reminded of the 23 billionth Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced the granting of a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its double source for the contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms established to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing the tax from offices on the Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The income from this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices, which already exists, "to be modernized in order to increase the revenue derived from it and so that this increase affects the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Overwhelmed.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're up to four billion miles away.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital grant, which will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
"From the moment we created the revenue (both taxes, NDLR), we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion," he explained.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will be allocated only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion still belong to absentee subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat turbulent parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on December 7.
Scammy hackers and caustic scouts
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates the future controlled by regression.
But let's do it right.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
Berlusconi's "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about the way of sexual life announce what for months anyone could read in any newspaper (all except these two Berlusconi own), and the clichéd cartoon profile of Kadhafi has long been a subject for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of messages already known is fundamental to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that deals with esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mysteries of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, the editor of the Libération newspaper), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
Why, then, was there such a habit around the revelation of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the heads of states can call or fly to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises, have been transformed into representation.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it seems to be ignored only out of hypocrisy.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public, defames the duty of hypocrisy and throws the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most tightly concealed information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not a negligible one, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executor".
But let's move on from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to understand all power as some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orwell’s prophecy has been proven ever since, that by being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, a hotel visited, a used highway, and so on, a citizen became a complete victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now, that even the "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - chosen as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can one maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that George Simmel has already said that the true secret is a non-comprehensive secret (and a non-comprehensive secret can never be revealed to Hillary); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret non-comprehensive secret, because it is taken out of public life, but that it has been taken out of public life.
WikiLeaks made no mistake about Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something great for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the power vested in us?
It is obvious that in the future countries will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equivalent to its publication on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep the message secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to keep private and sensitive messages secret in the future?
I know that for the moment my prediction belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who transport discreetly the fulfillment of formalities along uncontrollable routes and carry with them only those messages that know the memory or rather hide the precious information underfoot.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-locked drawers: overall, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving side by side, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph marked a revolution in communications, the Internet has rehabilitated a wire-based telegraph (telephone).
Video cassettes (analog) have allowed cinema lovers to shoot a film step by step, move it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (numeric) allow only to jump through chapters, that is, after macropores.
By high-speed train, we get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while for the journey by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is no wonder, then, that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn carriages.
The last note.

Climate: How France Hacked Its Financing Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the implementation of fast-start or early-start financing promises made by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (that is 420 million annually).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its pledge of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference year: international funding has been maintained and it is adding another 150 million over three years to the title of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of aid granted by France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) in order to comply with its commitment regarding the financing of "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proven for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , but we should not take it as an egalitarian for the sake of its value.
But France can provide only such a justification: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which it makes up 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36,1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the EU that uses the loan on this scale.
Germany has requested 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) have complied with their obligations with 100% of the donations.
In other words, when the absolute majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 on as part of fulfilling its promise, it gives France only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
What a beautiful piece of cake!
To sum up, in its financing "fast start" France operates with a double check: on the one hand with the development of stocks over time and on the other with a real financial burden.
Despite spending only 36.1 million euros, he can convince himself that he is spending 420 million euros "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is just a small, relatively short-term question in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and fairness towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing deposits for long-term financing (another key chapter currently under discussion): let us not avoid the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are credited.
France should change its stance to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
So everyone is putting their hope in the new environment minister, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to be able to move forward in the discussions.
Pesticide alarms that children are exposed to.
A 10-year-old child will one day be exposed to 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Future Generations Association (formerly the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations Movement).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of analyzed samples, but are characteristic of the processed issue", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light dish in a light dish.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sweets, were analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is crushing: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified among carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptors to inner-extrusion (PE) glands, according to studies by several research institutes.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is contagion," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, cited by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, where studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced beef steak, canned tuna, and even goose and chewing gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues, and even an analysis of a plastic plate used to heat food in a microwave oven did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this “coke of contaminants” is likely to be underestimated,” the study concludes.
The Environmental Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed "face to face an urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the growth of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
