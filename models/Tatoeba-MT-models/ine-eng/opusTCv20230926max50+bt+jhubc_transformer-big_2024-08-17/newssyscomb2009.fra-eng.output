Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a noticeable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Governor of Carinthia J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the vote.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP grand coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained the same 18 percent and BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96>'s part of the European government was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZ<0xC3><0x96>'s
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently focused on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back, among the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth place.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four percent limit and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegally collecting cockroaches in India could not be solved, then, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee says, as he leaves talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in court cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
As a result, he could seek bail and await trial at large, he said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," says the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided to them by India.
Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which has a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great disdain," he said.
The minister evaded the question of whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a number of promises," he said.
A Czech Referee Fighting for the Seabed
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of 30 members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
It contains oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider bottom than the firm ground
The coastal states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they actually use their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, in accordance with the Convention, claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive prospections and metrology.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five requests, those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater holdings, has recently seen a global outpouring.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission awarded to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the country's area multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will reap in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they see fit, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no longer any state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, adding that "its zones are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area proposed by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is enlivened there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer, lists.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee in the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were there to free the hostages.
The Egyptian government had sought Germany’s help in resolving the hostage crisis – experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists of the federal army and officials of the GSG 9, the air squadron of the federal police and the federal criminal police office, as well as logistics experts of the Technischen Hilfwerk were on the scene of the liberation.
As the Ministry spokesman reported on Monday night, German forces were finally not required, as the hostage-takers had freed their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"Fortunately, that hasn't happened so far," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were smuggled into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, those who have been saved have arrived safely and safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and special forces should have taken off aboard an Airbus from the air force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout of financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout plan in favor of financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to a favorable vote although the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout plan could capitulate.
It went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting new severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, approval and the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking numbers already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have increased to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one Third.
Next to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very busy so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in pints to litre and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is a blonde TV host and wears a custom-tailored Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling up their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the Wei<0xC3><0x9F>wurst Equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Place Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, everything is half as bad.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blasé or embarrassed - that's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume harvests a few odd eyeballs at the stand of the bananas-choc<0xC3><0xB3>.
A Bavarian woman points out to me that I would have attached my apron badly: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right case, on the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my loop from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she says and laughs.
Others don't give up so much for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us to their naked backstage without being invited.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
He told me all this after he had relieved himself of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild squealers."
Others are not lucky enough to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunkards under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers shouts to me in response to my question and then disappears into the mix.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 feet away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, such as some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition-laden train exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves, at least symbolically, to highlight the broadening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a bedcar in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Su<0xC3><0xA2>t Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and by many pastries in which middle managers in suits-cravate-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with either of them.
She had to do both.
“But at some point, I asked if ‘Turkey should not choose’.
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all of those with whom I have been able to speak have recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe metaphorically traveling on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been called "the sick man of Europe".
At the very least, there is no longer any doubt on the continent that this fascinating country could claim.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include children under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to tell us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baton technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and, sometimes, they’ve even inspired me.
Tod Handley held so rarely this combination of grandeur and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “focus only on certain people.”
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff's obituary (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950, became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That's what came out of Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hublon, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda's Super Sales
In November, Honda will begin commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thinks of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Officials at the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand leaders hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is, 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16% in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-size hybrid - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The Insight’s commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters in addition), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part with respect to the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, making the engine more powerful and increasing engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have built this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of Nissan’s safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is known as a Laser Range Finder.
It detects the obstacles that are over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device only has to process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logics of previous maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This is the first car to develop new collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in standard cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, apart from having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'The Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the Hotel Master makes us think several times if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game gives useful but not detailed information.
This is no longer a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game is over?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house

Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common stock at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities that will provide a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 at around 5:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, “we thought that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in one year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, at approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG’s capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group declined to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "clearly" eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been grueling for the group, which has seen its stock price halve as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
This cost declined on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, it was the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As a matter of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place quietly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the captors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were returned safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at al-Maza military base, docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 on a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, launched the assault on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," the official, who requested anonymity, said.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to Sudan in total, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies this election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the amounts of misery that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic places that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoires du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with researching history, preserving private archives with three of them, and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a grandstand for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, to the amount of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution in Hong Kong.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, by also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been intensifying for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions that will be taken in the case of Fortis Bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (up to 49%) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch company ABN Amro.
In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell 12 percent, to its lowest level in 14 years.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the overseas, in connection with the adoption of the American rescue plan of 700 billion dollars, of being the cause of the fall of the shares of Fortis.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Earlier, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agencies were taken on assailant.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information about the prescription of drugs, in any case, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting his chicken coop to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and insured capital depend on the client’s health condition, and if they think the risk is too great, they don’t even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after learning of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides himself with data on the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines for himself, what disease the person suffers and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol-lowering, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or against hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have grown in data research and analysis, and they need to ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past failures.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests, linking them to data on drug use, so they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of usage is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope of action extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to widen the scope of authorities' control over data supply companies is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus, and ultimately, the chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, issues.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where there will be a focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging great democratic power that should be given a broader right to speak in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would multiply trade by two, which means a rise of a billion dollars.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious target.
In this sense, they have harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights from a legal point of view, so that air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's top trading partner, and, on the other hand, New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this issue has been raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains true to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a global market should be passed at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is today in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italy Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying in the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there is no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dismissed the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is indeed the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) reported that hours after the wreck was found, a team of investigators sent to the site identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing Fosset's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long series of records.
On the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not waiting for.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the latest born of the "compact" off-road of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
It is precisely because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content that will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus, the hype that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
He had never been in a fight with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (few in reality) from Campania and Puglia joined.
They had tricolor flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English football team.
In Bulgaria, they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the actions that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the fans arrested or identified in the riots purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Good luck.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others risk adding to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of Ultras Italy supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm extended during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the prefect in Trieste where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, to hire Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoid was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory's No. 1 - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see well what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polished.”
