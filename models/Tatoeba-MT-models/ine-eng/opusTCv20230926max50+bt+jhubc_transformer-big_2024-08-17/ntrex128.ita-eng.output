Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "being the clowns"
Some members of the Assembly are confounded by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal was made as a result of the plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House across the political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that it "may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means asshole and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was "open" to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The committee of the assembly, which is currently in the process of drafting for the introduction of the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of how the members of the assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the possibility of calling the Welsh Parliament assembly.
As regards the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP option received greater approval in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the outcome of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing as the churches of Harlem are in trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"There's none of them today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people regularly frequent.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the estates won’t last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’ll go back to where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will rush to the moment when these churches will close altogether because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by confraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against 125th Street retailers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was "trying to discharge the costs" on the parish assembly, although the latter had not been involved in the hiring and hiring.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old in lobster fishing in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he was diving for lobster in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego-based KSWB-TV he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he understood that the boy was shouting 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His entire clavicle was torn," he said, noting that Hammel had once reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coastguard Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning a push into the beauty products industry in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the department store assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market push, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest beauty product lanes will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty products offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan – a quality increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of groceries daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit more to getting people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to restore enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended up in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, as opposed to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby defies <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of home furnishings and accessories Truly.
The couple's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host turned to Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby left her star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trend branding business to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "angry" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to devote to their brand of housewives and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was calculated to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave has left all the people involved speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "doesn't want to comment on his business dealings."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "newspaper driver."
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the U.N. General Assembly held on Saturday, that North Korea did not observe an “equivalent response” from the U.S. to North Korea’s early disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea, we are getting good results,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded field, we’d have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastate an island, causing hundreds of casualties
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they don't want international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continuously subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although it had been given the alarm, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia’s shackled infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko’s administration as it prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the more conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes due to clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool equals Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by a point in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from Chelsea's door, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga by pocketing into the net.
“It was just trying to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave it a touch and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Blue’s centre-forward passed Mateo Kovacic off the heel before skipping close to half-field and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
So he performed a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame defense and finished in second place with a left-footed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped among the rubble of the buildings that collapsed following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and that generated waves up to 6 meters high, the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency spokesman said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to make an appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the find this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police have said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the 247 registry of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last monument hit by wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pig Takes Down a Chinese Farmer by Killing Him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pig at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said that in the pig there was a large male pig with blood on its nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had unloaded the breeder, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered with blood and bruised,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police are gathering evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba breeder told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst."
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to do harm.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Pink’s Traps Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwest U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. coast in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a rift is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastwards toward the U.S. West Coast.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northwards, in the southwestern part of the U.S.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Thus, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching landslide will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2.5-10 cm is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and thunderstorms will bring wind to gusts and raise dust.
The approaching landslide will cause heavy local rainfall on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and beginning of Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong temperature swings over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected to be a warm early October for much of the central and eastern U.S., with 26oC from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows the strong above-average temperature probability for the eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turnaround on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford has informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in a drunken state and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during a fiery deposition, claimed to be 100% certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is a similar audience to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion groups strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican released a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operatives on Friday morning while being insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes while being reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had released the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the commission hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the assurance that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘doing politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans of letting the European Union “face politics” with Britain’s future and jeopardizing national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another side-by-side interview with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their tariffs is "absolutely ridiculous"
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect in the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a firearm death suspect from Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to jail on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they had detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated television station WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The office of the East Baton Rouge medical examiner issued a preliminary report Friday, in which it says the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department acknowledged the merit of the Louisiana State Police’s task force for fugitives, the police science lab, Southern University police, and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano ash splashes Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the different rhombuses and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City’s Xochimilco neighborhood.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s controversial vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by riot police targeted police officers with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There was further collusion during the day with police officers who resorted to handcuffs to contain the fight.
For several hours, groups of independentists chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive care for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place in seats across the region with violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite winning a landslide victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement’s most well-known leaders being in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring success.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Introducing myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after raiding a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 PM BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston sealed the victory
The Livingston already promoted left the Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is thus without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will have to face the first in the Hearts standings next Sunday, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston continues his winning streak in the division remaining undefeated for six games, with coach Holt still having to see a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against unincisive guests
Holt’s team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he stepped in to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble with placed kicks.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but the defending host team had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have to worry too much.
This pattern persisted during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston play pattern.
Crossings took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands of rigor, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for foul play, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their playing style and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top tier, but Holt has to be given a lot of credit for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some points with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
It missed the last pass - only once they managed to penetrate into the opponent's area - and can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan Received with Contrasting Reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (September 29) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at easing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police motivated with security reasons the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, when a street pirate raided Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded During a Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin maximum security male prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to manage the riot, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to a prison wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison.”
The Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack on a prison.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to intervene in the prison to sedate a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the Center for Drought Monitoring, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land firmly through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or in the evening on Monday.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and into southern Utah in the late evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her trascichi are heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora area and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Such rains are expected to generate potentially lethal flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Aggression: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have picked up the phone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately denying and deciding Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing defending himself from the charge.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with unrivalled record in public service,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I really do,” he said.
"For this batch strenuously for exceptional candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committed to “resisting and hindering.”
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake in Indonesia and tsunami, and numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many swept away by giant waves that crashed on the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) high hit the beach at dusk, wiping out numerous people by killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus becoming victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster control agency BNPB.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Landing tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geography, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300-km (190-mile) coast north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications “were totally paralyzed, with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting in a hectic way to warn people of the coming tsunami in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall collapsed on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees took refuge under waxed canvas shelters in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the rescue teams began the difficult start-up operations of the rescue gears, there were some complaints that foreign rescuers with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing were still hopeful that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a baby was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding drivers.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu’s competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single grey check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a vending machine refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to hand over more money, researcher Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "fell behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identities of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, speaking of the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our wickedness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without dashes and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds devoted to research in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by several U.S. government groups about AI, although the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its program last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Redoubling the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American Otello player with the highest score and later was executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese section.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking away the leaders in academia, it’s the multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence security has not registered activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbors constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June under the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority-Slav Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with the accession to NATO and the EU and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in favor.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a Skopje-based voter.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name that would open the door to joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Front in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go head-to-head, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it was established in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dealt with Brighton's defence during the 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it extremely easy to score his point in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the free field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated one defender before surpassing several others at the Brighton area boundary.
He then made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right shot in the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about getting him to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along his left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward pulled the ball into the net shortly before leaving the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who retain an advantage from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one rematch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first division title.
“Even if we play aimless, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first pitcher for the 34th time, performed a pitching session on Thursday and would be the first pitcher on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of the influx of Republicans in midterm elections.
“Everything we did was put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really working for that I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “Let’s see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using whatever means necessary, you can see the malice, the meanness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control and we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
“And it’s been possible to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, mean and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, sparking strong outcry among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don’t tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting states that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a member of parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a “kinder and courteous” policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
This all began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of the trend on my part and that I would take positions I would never accept, whether it be national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow inveterate insults on social media calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the center's policy and telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexual or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given many advices, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would be fine".
But that’s not what I got into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the carelessness of the Thatcher government that had let my high school class literally fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way bewildered by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm family nuclei, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent Championship Day.
I'm now at the top of the standings, the only team out of ten that's undefeated.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said, “You have to acknowledge Ayr’s merit, they’ve made better use of our opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed a non-converted goal.
Climo increased the Ayr's distance by a penalty before, right at half time, to score and then to convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was therefore a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was caused to stretch, and at the restart, the Ayr jumped again to advantage thanks to a goal from Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's deputy captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose made the man pay extra with an unconverted goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a clash with Climo without a ball, by the touch of the rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advancing midfield.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the football from the David Armstrong area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, a star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, who writes and plays alongside long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reporting lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to release statements, although a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering trade."
''The sea is ours'': Bolivia without an outlet to the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a tailor-made naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean-blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without an outlet to the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile's hands after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have peaked in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of the State's jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has much to do with Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the final rulings indicates that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has faltered any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions after what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he explained.
Calzadilla also denied he Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as political escapades.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to get past the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Without Confidence in U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington first.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on resuming stalled diplomatic talks after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an “illusion” that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration of an end to the Korean War could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of issuing the declaration without Pyongyang first carrying out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is intent on giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge headgear that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the rays of the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled on the catwalks a series of crazy oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have raged on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations onto the catwalk.
The main piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled angoras, a witch hat, and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks feature sewn lips and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than haute couture.
One creation looked like a complete for diving with mask and goggles, while another looked like a dissolved ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you are lucky.
Observers of the style predict that the huge hats could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
Outsize hats come in the wake of “The Bomb,” the straw hat with a span of more than a meter that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag nearly as big as the model in costume who wears it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ La Riviera’s spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has made such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this was continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector able to develop and adopt a customized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanded subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the message will come to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to your heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the most votes.
The data, collected by the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students got the highest grade with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish got the highest grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons that employees indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have an actual advantage in the future with a life-long skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in language teaching is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with staff teaching specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first innings with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be established for how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare me,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a rally.
This is the first of five meetings planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s rally be and how can you follow it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online at via the live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will likely talk about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual violence with a Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help Republicans who have to face the November elections get some push.
So, President Trump’s campaign stated that these five gatherings over the next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into the campaign's busiest season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum bike is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
Where would the bike be now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so I’d say we’re keeping a bit of a bike,” Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, four points ahead with twelve others at stake.
Americans feel they have a little wind in their favour, as Spieth said, and have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to match the scores to Game Four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the 15 hole game was greeted with a similar scream, one that tells you he believes the American team isn’t out of the race yet.
"You really have to put it all in to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That’s all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed version of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd solidifies the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes have sunk the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they have not even managed to climb far.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way the strategy can change at a moment’s notice.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained an important lead in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the fourball and foursome games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to regain the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points out of the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a knocked down Woods and the American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who trailed for two games on Saturday, showed occasional splashes of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not get all the results hoped for on a pleasant and ventilated day south-west of Paris.
Three-time great winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team come back from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as a holder, Furyk’s team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea Completely Rejects Untrusted Unilateral Disarmament
North Korea’s foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was fueling the country’s mistrust of the U.S., which in those circumstances would have absolutely refused to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organization General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any consistent response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and under these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri has re-used the well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as previously done by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised assurances of North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to 'have a denuclearization first' and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, Ri’s tone of speech was markedly different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korean missiles after “the president of evil” Trump had called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
In front of the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a deadline, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and assured denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously endorsed sanctions control of North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of filing "gangster demands."
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US had taken “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security assurances Trump had committed himself to in Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all of its students to sleep longer in an attempt to counter the growing male culture of studying for entire caffeine-fueled nights.
A university scholar has found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“In the end a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this only now, when I’m in my senior year?’
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s director general of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dorm room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the “white night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and having a good quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid fattening since lack of sleep brings the brain into sleepless mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar study program before enrolling in this competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm for when they need to go to bed, as well as when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression from outside the home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for their first away win since the February 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coach games leaving his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-lived Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
While the Ranger now drops to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind the Hibernian as opposed to goals.
And there could be further problems arriving for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside of the home.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual lineup that ripped off a point at the Hearts last week and would be pleased with the way his well-prepared team suffocated their opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated for possession of the ball but Livingston made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga’s first-time filter pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s door but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep-punishment kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only pull aside on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to be assigned a rigor to the expiration of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian’s requests.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't let himself worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s 34th-minute opening goal may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even just for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in choosing Menga for a clean finish.
Gerrard acted during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the wing put a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself from the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final request for rigor after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEXT continues... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those incredulous cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "A little bit of it's really popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is yielding promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then those cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to “teach” them how to hit cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after an inconclusive performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a brawl against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I speak to white people and they say to me, ‘As you like Trump, he’s a racist!’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he explained.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against allegations of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's filipino was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time in the backstage due to his headdress.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
They told me ‘don’t go out with that hat on.’
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I was an outcast," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the paper: “A deadly silence has fallen on the studio.”
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West bewildered many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR TESTING THE MASS.”
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what she is and this is just wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) that I think is embracing a throwaway ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's friend, Snoop Dogg, called himself Snoop Lion and of course the missing musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus into the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast pretrial hearing on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Star of Throne of Swords Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, stating that such on-screen soils often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something went wrong" and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Swords Throne, 31, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
“Personally I’m worried, very much at the moment – what was our mistake with masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes boys think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because of course something went wrong for the young people.’
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not play any prequel or sequel to Throne of Swords once the series ends next summer, stating that he "has finished with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to Throne of Swords.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on,” she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, Kit's character, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has shrunk to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, and talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The U.S. congresswoman on Saturday denounced accusations made against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democratic MP said the statements were encouraged by "opinionists" and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"Buggies, lies and still despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol official during a hearing by a panel of experts on allegations of sexual violence against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information relating to a Waters staff member.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
He must not question the accuser's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to liken Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to dismiss Waters in the midterm elections, has expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if confirmed," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office has alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement to these biased claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English review hits again - spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has become customary now to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
The self-irony veil on the subject of how bad we make will be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent rubber-faced Johnny English and the eyes out of orbit got his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that this is a comic creation developed for non-English-speaking movie-goers countries.
Obviously he is the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed a single note to the theme of Glory moments of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character initially based on the mysterious international traveler and man who once played Atkinson in the now-forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, which left the chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers briefly chirping against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems directed at children rather than adults and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Mr Bean.
The immutable news premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the top-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a shoulder of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this similar character-Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And this means that the naughty Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a chic establishment, but who also teaches informal classes on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a School of Rock spying course.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are back in action, to meet the beautiful femme fatale of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the net of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the leftist Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they set off hell by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht, and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take in the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly made for the final sequence, but as sloppy and exuberant as it may seem, there’s quite a bit of children’s TV in the whole story.
Everything is quite modest.
And as with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working out a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, despite being paid for five.
The party would like the major companies to transfer the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour party told The Sunday Times: “By the end of the year, it is expected to announce a revision of the political line.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless executives" and "speculators" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire share package, since the Labour government could implement “deductions” on the basis of behaviours deemed illegal.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create funds for inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10% of the net assets of private sector companies to employees, which end up pocketing annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises doubts as to whether or not the government agency’s findings could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview to air on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring something to light that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said that as I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that the charge had come out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
It was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they might resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you nominate couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the performance of a remarkable cast of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Arriving at the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness of the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve the intended goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to ask for an appeal to action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel they really make a difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “shares” of its supporters, working for a lot of different purposes.
It says these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, aimed at impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far, protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-executor partnership committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” with the promise of providing Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Ci.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition were implemented, the government announced the expansion of funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria – in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage finance and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “unversifiable,” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its own liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is by far the cheapest.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, an “inappropriate” gas pipeline project that Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2, designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of a merely economic nature.
The Kremlin objects that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the option to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
The U.S. takeover triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Take ‘Serious Consideration’ of Running for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take "serious consideration" of running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he was contemplating the possibility of running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our messy government, and that means having a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the town assembly Warren said his about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
Warren wrote in a tweet on Friday: “It is natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a proposal.
The poll showed greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed on a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming back, I can relate it to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they become a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have devoted themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of firearms under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a memo amicus curiae in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged that policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang-member children" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
It's been put on hold in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a vast number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed asylum applications to be made to immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of the particular circumstances and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates that principle,” the memo states.
In the memo, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear likelihood that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or for political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
“There’s a lot of tension,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her feverish little baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“At every moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, toppling among their flimsy personal belongings, in an attempt to retrieve whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside at Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continued strong settling tremors.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the sensation given by the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
“There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “making overtures” with “advertising propaganda”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the beneficial trade loans between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to make propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referenced an ad paid for by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, a charge China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase of a Washington-led escalation campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war had been designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now increases those prepotency by publishing advertising propaganda in our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Vice versa, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population might have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate ahead of midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Given that many leading Republicans are advocating for Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
“You can’t withdraw these things,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan “November is coming!” during their protest in the Senate chamber, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation are going to the stars,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among undecided suburban electricians and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confusing whole,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, the Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of hecticness when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch a New Internet to Challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from the solid open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data warehouse is that it is completely up to the user to choose who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, is to bring adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely wiped out overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, gained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and he never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “magnifyingly symbolic” that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and the war machines".
He then rushed towards the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine a little, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to then be denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some stayed grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad-tasting joke".
"The government's regulations say that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pipe the pig," "yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But there are six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he changed program came a lot of messages and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We’re going to limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we’ve tried to get a lot for the fans, and we’ve just discussed that.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize, until he got to high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking in the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-time program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, “Today, the feeling of feeling less of, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed.”
He wanted to try to be “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they accidentally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When so many of them passed away at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know one thing, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still hadn’t realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – swimming in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come out as a goose.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-form Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth time as a record, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what torments him.
Having never been the strongest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the bumpy course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the path itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below at the start of their 12 singles matches, start with a scorching start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he played today, gave me a pat on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, sarcastic, he likes to play with people, and he’s a fantastic guy to have in the meeting room,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players had a lot of fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did a lot more than play.”
Europe’s captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon fade away.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep repeating to myself that we had a good advantage at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but little,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
“So history will prove to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to do our best.
You have to go out there and do everything right.
It is not over until the points are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who’s on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happily the way his team competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have made it.
Tomorrow’s challenge is different.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re only your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go out there and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will look for the best individual rather than team performance in his players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big games of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start right now with the right foot as we did in Brookline and in Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain bend, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that seems appropriate to us, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the match and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the way to the end,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's New Military Ship Delayed Again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the cold war, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The Rhineland-Palatinate commission, the flagship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will already become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated Type F-125 frigate made news last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if employed on a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly significant as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship weighs significantly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms regarding the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy actually "lacks ships that can be used".
The official said the issue has worsened significantly over time, as the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research conducted at a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use their sight to procure food.
It is hoped that the findings could shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protective activities.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists’ study will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as brown ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Analyses of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
They will then produce a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the findings could reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to best maintain bat forests and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work involving trespoli and ruining habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, due to their night-hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to grabbing a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the trespoli and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first bat-only reserve at the Threeave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"Here at Threeave we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trespolo could kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, annoy, disturb or destroy their trefoils.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations go about it.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Sue German Weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise themselves” with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In a video on Instagram aimed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, scrapped the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Ballon d'Or facing the camera.
"They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, calling it “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions about the private sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damages to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the privacy violation, considered probably one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years".
The event took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he subjected him to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have fallen to his knees after the incident, saying that he is for the "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK “may regret forever” the loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC regarding Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary shutdown of production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker claims that delays at the borders, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
There is growing concern in other UK carmakers about leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border disruptions could cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day’s worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely thought out to avoid these inconveniences at the borders.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the plant’s trade union delegates, says workers are deeply concerned: “Based on my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “rescheduled for a week” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s eventual obstruction of justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a handkerchief to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and was rumored to be resigning.
Instead, it was announced for Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI inquiries into Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s final vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and will continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The conductor Chris Wallace asked the reason for this.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion for TV journalists “showing off,” although he said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they show off.”
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him," he said, adding without citing evidence: "We checked the numbers."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
Let’s try to do that, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have proved the reason, making a free-wheeling, and at the same time bizarre, speech in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister Writes to Scottish NHS European Workers to Express His Concerns About Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to addressing the costs of requests for settled status (permanent resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and the communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much hope that you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was operated on as a result of a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, according to Mike Organ of The Tennesseean newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the interval.
"He approached the campground and fainted," Reed said.
First responders and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on board the camp, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no word on the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with the Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duties for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to new plans by Labour.
The maneuver will neutralize Corbyn’s successful initiative to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of the Treasury plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duties for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the government's initiative to combat the homeless phenomenon.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy to lets properties (purchased for rent), could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by grabbing land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “real estate woes.”
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for reform of the housing market, including checks on rents and the elimination of unwarranted evictions.
It also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, namely that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for resident British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My highest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland Technical Director Jack Ross says his "highest aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old is drawn to the challenge of resurrecting the Northeast team that is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving the St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I’ve been in series B and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC’s Scottish Sportsound programme.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims to feel no anxiety in following such important names, in a team as important, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I’ll only succeed if I can get the team back up.”
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from relegation to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the championship championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career with the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really believed that the role of manager was made for me, more than that of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and work pressure but management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I’m doing it, I feel much calmer than I’ve ever been in my life.”

According to one study, the right time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s commercial consultancy, put the data together and commented: “England’s persistence of the sun and long stay at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent drop in catering in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars in which you mostly drink were the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not in an excessive way like the restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out and have a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and receptive industry analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent decline in annual sales will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurateurs and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary respite.
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand roll-outs.

One in five children own secret social media accounts that hide from parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake” pages on Instagram.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted in the background
20 percent of students said they have a “principal” account to show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates social media accounts that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” Instagram accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted in the background.
Twenty percent of students said they managed a clean "main" account to show to their parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of those admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice for athletes’ at Scottish Athletics council
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board during the national general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those running the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland, athletics could gain a huge advantage by bringing it to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as a BBC opinionist, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
I thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
The advertising of a tiralatte compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A company that produces a tiralata has divided opinion online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers and cows that are munted.
To mark the launch of what is termed the “world’s first silent and wearable tiara,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom of expression as mothers given by the new tiara.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like "Yes, I suck my milk but I don't have a thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts but my boobs".
The chorus continues, "Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, give the milk to my ladies."
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook pages, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“An unfortunate decision is to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth.”
The Elvie pullover wears discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: “Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a tiralatte for moms who will continue to keep their kids?”
Someone else added, “It’s really pointless advertising.”
Others have defended it and a woman has even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd like one.
When I used the tiralata, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn’t go far from reality.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a fun ad dedicated to moms who use the tiralata (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like “cats.”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tiralatte inserted into the bra.
The concept that the campaign is inspired by is based on the idea that many women who use tiralate feel like cows.
The Elvie tyrannical is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be threaded into a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms and even get out while they suck milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD commented: “The Elvie sling is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing women who use tiralate to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tiralate is able to ensure."
This is not the first time Elvie has made the news.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tented camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy line have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them in were typically illegal immigrants who are now afraid to jeopardize the possibility of staying in the country by offering to make such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who offer to borrow children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work at the reception points.
Many will appear in video conferencing instead of in person, to plead their legal status case with an immigration judge.
Those who will be deemed unfit to receive help will be quickly expelled.
The longer children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, according to those who work in shelters and relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo in which, precisely because of its size, it is easier for the signs of discomfort of children to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tentopolis without giving them time to emotionally prepare or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to immediately withdraw
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately without putting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were favorable for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “inciting unfounded fears” that push refugees away from their homeland.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return,” he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be provided in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated."
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of members of the government and opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
Under this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency should not end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of bending of the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million first-night viewers, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” program surpassed the network’s percentages by reaching 3.5 million on the most important news evenings.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something that can be explained,” says Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC television series “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him the reason.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite or not, and the health status of the global economy.
Stopping following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond the duty of informed citizens to find themselves followed for the sixth consecutive hour by a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of treachery” Trump’s remarks imply and the Washington Post’s disgusts).
I, for example, will no longer be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
“Part of why what it does looks like a reality show is that every night there’s news,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars,” about the actors’ turnaround and the daily developments of the plot of the Trump show (in contrast to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
This week I went to meet Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite it being a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was closed at home to watch MSNBC and meanwhile he was recording CNN.
He failed to break away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and facing the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, “I remember when we used to do all those crazy programs and people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Outflow of money in the race for the tightest midterm elections
It’s no surprise that the 17th district is experiencing an influx of money thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has made two incumbents now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg brings in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another running member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that electoral colleges in the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district triggered a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought of penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, there was a rather friendly meeting between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of reprimand or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, on an anonymous basis, about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who still wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In the report that will be published, special counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact of which now seems to exist sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller’s investigation intends to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes on Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his own as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not mean to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight may last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion we failed to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans have to deal with different things right now.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested subjecting Trump to interceptions by questioning his ability to take on the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news published in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass this test, democracy will have to prepare itself for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she moved to America and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them an excellent opportunity to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season right on the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
“For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 30-year-old.
"We faced the game convinced to do well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the balance is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game. However, I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will manage not to disappoint.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level itself but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget about last season’s problems and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the cost of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of Nationwide’s respondents said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, said: “People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t address this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to assist you if you don’t communicate what you want in time.
If you have an advisor, decide together with him and your family members where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determining for costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he will be able to advise you on how to pay for the expenses you will have to face.
Choosing a financing for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy or a life-saving hybrid policy to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you weren’t able to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a question of finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”

He's not in any danger, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died as a result of a very strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications have been disrupted and rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called the Pacific Fire Belt and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she snatched her phone from her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable by a day of detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the reporting of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following her time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Extraordinary Capital Punishment for Suspected Terrorist Attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that killed eight people: a rare sentence that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to plunge onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the terms of the capital punishment request in the southern New York district, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued 22 indictments against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with a criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and vehicle destruction.
The attack called for "real planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused damage, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York pursued the last case of capital punishment.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged with passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say they are proud of what they have done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
With regard to the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and sentencing to life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously pleaded with prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE must lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would already be out of Europe" if Farage were the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underscored by the pro-residence Tory in Europe who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and the "chaos".
At the start of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"By this time we would already be outside Europe," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: “I’m in favour of Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would change from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
MP Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also took part in the rally and told reporters: “I’m just telling the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and will not enjoy the favors of our party and of our activists who run the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises.”
At the hearing, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they intend to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against the flags of Brexit after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour leader mocked conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be seriously considering running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that could challenge Trump in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it is now time for “women to go to Washington to settle the government and this implies that a woman fills the highest office.”
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday they arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a gun and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in a state of detention at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 games, 10 of which to play with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the Mercedes team’s orders would heavily condition the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the pits leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, which could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the next stop by returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtakes him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent its passage inside, risking to finish out after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the gearbox and tries to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps is not able to increase the pass and overcome Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked really well all weekend and he was really kind to let me through.
The team did an outstanding job of winning first and second place,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a hearing on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not disclosing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a hearing in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “cheers, bad guys and liars.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and liars," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being released and those responsible say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't," she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is leaked from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible to the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “See, I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of attempted sexual offense by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the meanness. They don’t care who they harm, who they have to pass on to regain power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants went straight ahead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to a draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the draw for the Dundees before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ruled their win.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had come back and won the match with the Dundees 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was initially quite animated, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt provided the assist of the draw to Cownie at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer ruled the lead for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard regained the draw after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which brought the Dundees to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed the victory of his team by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games at this point, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight Controller Dies To Allow Hundreds Of Passengers To Escape The Earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are scattered due to a strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong settling tremors continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues having fled to save his life, twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which oscillated fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the runway, was able to take off safely.
He then threw himself out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is really sad news for us,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Response Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it was impossible to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?” as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after the incident of the lagoon
The airline of the flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after saying that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing one.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, one passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels allowed the other passengers and crew to be rescued after the crash while the plane was attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane arrived at a very low altitude.
“And it was really lucky,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that was coming to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to set up a pier provided relief by using a dinghy to transport people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in plane crashes on PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burned woman alive
The prosecution’s evidence in the new lawsuit against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 came to an end on Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used his cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
According to reports from The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several mobile phones showing that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data indicates that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"She erased it from her life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the verdict to be handed down to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages into their songs.
Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their roots and do some kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City dad cites a couple in court for firing her with a “racist” text
In New York City, a father cited a couple in court for dismissing her in a discriminatory manner after she mistakenly received a text in which her mother complained that she was “another black.”
The couple denies being racist by comparing the demand to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new stepdad, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she was not happy with their previous dad, an African-American, and that she expected a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice a day's work and sent her home by taxi.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, for being fired, seeks $350 per day in compensation for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do as they feared they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you’ve been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that the wife has given birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t get along with someone like that.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial advisor added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced the spouses on social media harshly criticizing them for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments: “It’s not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s funny now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father was modestly proud of her success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” she says.
“But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved as if he had a son who achieves a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your fault.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed merit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not have done it,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me she was going to die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a little while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit back and wait knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“Nobody knew,” he says.
“All the time I’ve done nothing but cry with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women in pain to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide commit suicide to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” he says.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said he lit up every room he went into.”
But before he died, he left his job because depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know there's someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark not long after his mother's death.
“You never said you felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking them in the eye."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to deal with: "It has torn the family apart.
He broke us into pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: FBI begins investigation
"I think that if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and in scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "losing its cool" due to the blockade of entrenched supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left in the midterm elections, on November 6. If Republicans as expected will get a negative result, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to get the man they chose for the Supreme Court elected.
George W. Bush called on senators to press for support for Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Number of Political Refugees 'Decreases' with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, says refugees were 1,127 last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs asked by those who illegally bring these people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This follows the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of development since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not characteristically fit to fill that role.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman behaved in the same way, they would call her hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's statement Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
In a visibly emotional way, Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually molesting Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was full of emotion, so much so that he almost screamed and his throat narrowed with tears as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned committee Democrats who have called the allegations against him a "silly and coordinated smear campaign" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he can’t go to the Supreme Court because he’s proven to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he self-excluded himself with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh in case it was confirmed and if Democrats should reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not fit for the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit for the court he’s presiding over right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, “You cannot send a hysterical person and party to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way.”
And women need to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of angry attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she continued, "A woman who was a leader somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought his was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as outbursts of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a male-dominated office dates back to when I once started crying for an access to anger. An older woman than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified took me by the curb and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let me see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they have you in their fists.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart on his run for president.
In 1987, when Hart’s extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn’t try to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t really a well-considered decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and we definitely didn’t need another one.
Someone called them "Biancaneve and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and swore she wouldn’t run if she hadn’t raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause from the start.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the men candidates $1,000 would only give her 250.
“Do they think I can get a discount?” he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
“It looked like I was in the grip of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled, thinking about the reaction of the press.
“Someone would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "Pianse molto"."
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the US-China trade war have been blistering and, while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth over $200 billion (175 billion euros) worth. This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods from China.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same kind by recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. one-on-one and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon turn back.
Because Washington gave up, it would have to yield to its demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively influence China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than has been recognized so far,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security research center.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees in the country who have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any conditional aid or from those countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3 giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds by becoming one of only four players to ever score a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the ranking Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who has played eight of them, has become the European player who has won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I won the cup.
It’s a team win and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” said an excited Garcia after the European win.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram who beat the US golf legend Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 in Sunday's singles.
“If I think I grew up watching his meetings, I’m really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now the count of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team searched for fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I’m passionate about these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
We've got it all figured out.
They played better than us.”
