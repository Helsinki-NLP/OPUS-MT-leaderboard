Members of the Welsh Assembly worry that they “look like muffins”
Some of the members of the Assembly were appalled by the proposal to change their title to "CUP" (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be a source of ridicule.
One of the Labour MPs said his group was concerned that the new name was "riddled with Dumb and Dumber."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the entire group was “not happy” and offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "not pre-conceived" about the name change, but noted that the new name "MWP" has a certain verbal resemblance to "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names, by which the members of the Assembly are called, will belong to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established widespread support for the Assembly to begin to be called the "Parliament of Wales".
As far as the position of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers ‘Members of the Parliament of Wales’, in short ‘CPU’, but the ‘CUP’ option has received the most support following an interview with the public.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching a consensus will clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill on the amendment in a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is an opponent of the referendum on changing the name of the state, has said that he will not read the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price that must be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silenced against the backdrop of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“If we look from a historical perspective, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner,” Adams said.
“Both of them are gone today.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today are socialized in different ways,” he added.
“The bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be in the same position.”
The man added that the churches could be replaced by blocks of apartments where people live who do not help the survival of the other sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and “St. Martin” a decade later.
The original white Methodist flock emerged in the years after 1930.
Then the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was taken by black Christians under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, at which they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly calls them the “Poor Bells.”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool".
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentioned that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought in by the world leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
From the vicarage – which is the governing body of the parish, consisting of the world leaders – the parish wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concerns that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the expenses of the vicarage”, although it did not have a role in hiring archeologists.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy injured by shark in California lobster hunt
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and set out with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, then realized how he was screaming “Bite me!
He bit me!"
Hamel says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn apart.
“I’ve called on everyone to get out of the water because there’s a shark!”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Gilles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was judged not to be of a dangerous species.
Gils adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of her body.
Authorities have closed access to the shoreline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons as the investigation continues.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an offensive on the UK market for decorative products
Sainsbury faced Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening booths for beauty products at its facilities where customers would be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty market, which is valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest to date beauty stands will be located in 11 stores across the country.
The investment turnaround in the beauty industry is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the shelves, until recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of beautification products offered to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space, similar to the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique range of make-up so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test discount programs at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to put more effort into attracting shoppers.
Mike Cope, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggled with the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury’s has Argos facilities in hundreds of stores, and has also opened Habitats facilities since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has boosted food sales and made the gains even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to reshape its facilities for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
From there, they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan, providing a rich range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and character of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and every need in a captivating setting with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for decorative products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willaby's rejection of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons star Den Peter Jones has been "infuriated" after TV host Holly Willaby abandoned a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willaby does not have time for the brand of household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple’s business is compared to Guinevere’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" leader announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willaby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones to “boil” after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle products business at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "infuriated" when the "golden girl" on television admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million -- mean there will be no more time for his brand-name housekeepers.
The business is similar to Guinevere's Goop brand, with rumours that it has doubled Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willaby announced her departure from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on a plane to head to one of her vacation properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave is completely unprepared for everyone.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
The Marlow plant has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of "This Morning", which is one of the UK's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a delay in the market.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willaby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willaby herself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who is 52, joining as president of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willaby will become the brand’s “ambassador” for M&S and will also replace Anne McParlin as host of I Am A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business dealings.”
Difficult negotiations leading to a "warming of relations"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from news channels for making a comment that someone would consider "inappropriate for the president" and too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his own joking “newspaper” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as a “big step towards the elimination of North Korea’s nuclear weapons.”
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea “sees no reciprocity” on the part of the U.S. toward its country’s first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful,” he said.
“We went to war with this country.
Millions of people would die.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — ending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the bodies of U.S. servicemen to their homes.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unequivocal opinion that no international aid is required, which makes things a little challenging,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country’s territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to the reconstruction efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains still unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common sight on the other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has headed for Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s lagging infrastructure the center of his election campaign by investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his cabinet as Joko heads back to the urinals next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturges has brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturges saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturges received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team lag behind 1-0.
He set the ball on his left foot, then made a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed for the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the stranded Kepa Arisabalaga and became entangled in the net unscathed.
“I tried to take a good position to get the ball in because players like Shak always look for submissions in the front positions, so I just tried to earn as much time as possible for a good shot to the goal,” Sturges told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante, I pushed my ball and I just shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward pitched to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a quick double pass in the center.
He then released a fast-fired pass, bringing Hazard into a clean position in the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea’s next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's Tsunami Death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early on Sunday.
Many people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu with more than 380,000 people is dotted with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder began this morning in Burkenhead, Merseyside, where a woman's body was discovered.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from John Street's Grayson Moose stab, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of committing the murder.
The police are asking everyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I implore anyone who has been near John Street in Burkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have filmed something with the cameras on their dashboard, to contact us as it is possible that they have vital information at their disposal for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkenhead and that she had been found in a private property.
This afternoon a group of friends, who consider the woman to be their acquaintance, arrived at the scene and inquired where she had been found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson's Moose tried to return to his apartment, but was notified by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border while another van remained outside.
There are police officers at the border who are monitoring the housing block.
Anyone with information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes Latest Memorial Hit by 'Rewriting History'
Her ban would be a poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate to remove Oliver Cromwell’s statue to the Palace of Westminster to become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognisable person who represents one side of the division that has occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
Pig Killer Injures Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood near a stall at Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the neighboring hut open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody urchin in the car.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked the farmer fatally, the report said.
“My cousin’s leg was bleeding and disfigured,” said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it could not attack someone else while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and the market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although rare, it has previously been reported of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood may act as a “pump”.
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they are not meant to hurt anyone.
But a man should also treat them with respect,” the man concludes.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and torrential rains in the southwestern U.S.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane counted at 5 a.m. Sunday morning east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a syncline, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep to the north to the southwest.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching syncline will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, with torrential debris and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will result in rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It will be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and gusty winds.
The approaching syncline will lead to heavy rains in some parts of California’s southern coast.
It is possible to reach rainfall of more than half an inch, which will lead to minor waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the rainy season.
In late Sunday and early Monday scattered clouds, carrying tropical rain, will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring large temperature fluctuations to the U.S. as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is a nearly 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most central and eastern U.S. states are expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures expected to predominate around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blacy Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued as networks disrupted their regular turnaround programs in the final minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that required the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had pushed her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his unemotional testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing did not happen.
It’s probably even more than Nielsen’s reported 20.4 million viewers had watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally had difficulty measuring the number of people who look out of their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleck was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After exiting the office of the moderate Republican with a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured him on Friday playing with protesters as he tried to catch an elevator for a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During the entire harassment for a few minutes he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's presenting the truth to the state?
“You have power while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Fleck replied that he had already left his office with a statement and, before closing the doors of the elevator, announced that he would speak further during the hearing by the commission.
Cable and broadcast networks provided a tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate vote.
Ala Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats in the opposition are pushing for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Queens.
After talking to Queens and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘political hoaxes’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political hoaxes" with Britain's future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Game Plan" for Brexit, proposing that the collection of customs duties from the UK was "absolutely absolutist" for the EU.
The shooting of Wade Sims: Police arrest suspect Childen Simpson for the death of the player from LSU
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Children Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to fatally shooting Wade.
His bail has been set at $350,000, Advocate reports.
The Department of Forensic Medicine in eastern Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday that cited a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The administration expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police’s refugee search department, the police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents for the assistance provided during the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU’s athletics director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for “temporary justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall 6 foot 6 inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "crashed" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “This is something that worries a person all the time.”
A volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and in the last 24 hours, 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded.
The center has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media showed a thin layer of dust covering the car’s windshields in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to smear the peacekeepers with eggs and paint powder, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which usually swarm with tourists.
Later in the day there were other clashes with the police, and the police resorted to their sticks to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while those who declared themselves to preserve the country’s integrity responded with “Spain forever.”
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the desired independence region even a year after a referendum held on October 1 was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted to give their vote for independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region with a series of violent clashes.
The independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to go on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined a separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds out hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be at a standstill.”
Despite the marked important victory, either by a small margin, in the regional elections last December, Catalonia’s pro-independence political parties are experiencing difficulties this year as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or arrested pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum.
Hoan Piog, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary trial from last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government.”
Londonderry: Arrested men after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that damage has been done to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston surprised the Rangers and made only a second loss to Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as the club's manager at IBROX.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team was tied for second place in the Hibernian standings.
Gerard's team remains without a win on a foreign pitch in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faces the leader Harts, from which he lags behind by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a six-game series without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of loss since switching to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the idealess guests
Holt's team had to lead in the result far before scoring a goal, and his direct playing style made it extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his shot went sideways, after which Alan Litgou shot down the beam after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts let Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hinder the guests from static positions.
And that’s how we got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined with each other and brought out Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
By this time the Rangers had mastered the ball more, but faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Rangers goalkeeper Scott Pittman saved with a foot shot, and Littleo's head shot passed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's penalty area were the centers, which, however, were easily cleared, and the judge twice did not respect the guests' claims for the penalty - first after a duel between Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubts about hand play.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and composition had hardly changed since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warle under constant strain.
At the same time, the Rangers did not show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard’s guidance, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were far below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, having only once managed to split the defense of the hosts – this loss must wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down due to issues affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to discover a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but nevertheless, many supporters flocked around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the breakup caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist rests after a collision with a car
A cyclist has died after a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but nevertheless the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located nearly a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The Metropolitan Police announced that its employees are working on the identification of the man, after which they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riot
Six prison guards were injured in a high-security male prison riot, according to the Prison Service.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still going on.
In order to master it, special employees of the Tordano detachment were called, who would have to deal with eight prisoners, such as the mutiny itself in a limited to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to their faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prisons Service said: “Specially trained staff have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six of the guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we state very clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police officers were called to the prison, where they would master a severe riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with flash flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although the arid areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there’s a good chance it will happen early next week, as the weakening Hurricane Rosa carries through the desert to the southwest, carrying with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already established anti-flood posts on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with late Monday likely to bring rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of overtaking possible in separate locations.
For those who are not threatened by flash floods, the rain caused by Rose may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by the drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring commission, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second-most severe category.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The rose, which on Sunday morning can still boast a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm occurs with cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach land near Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of flooding.
"Summary rains of up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora are expected, with up to 10 inches possible," the weather.com report said.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until late Tuesday evening.
“The main risk from Rosa or its aftermath is extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Northon around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remained stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have taken a picture of what happened to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has been hurt by the ugliness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffered by the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of the indictment.
The president made a statement on Saturday that “the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities” of Kavanaugh.
“Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public,” the president told a gathering of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our time.
Even though I’m not a candidate, in fact, I’m also involved,” Trump said.
“That’s why I’m running around and fighting for good candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves a mission to “prevent and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican party official told CNN.
Hundreds dead after earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people have lost their lives after many were swept off the coast by a massive wave when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at dawn the coast was swept by waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, took many to their deaths and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami struck after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster,” Indonesia’s disaster agency spokesman Purvo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The water had taken cars, trees, entire houses, hit everything on its way,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and were able to save themselves from the water,” he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Pictures from the air released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, as well as a water-surrounded mosque.
The secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) released a statement saying that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentioned that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, for its part, said more than 300,000 people were living there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already made their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for failing to report the devastating Palou tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall collides in the shore and affects both cars and buildings.
Reuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage, which halted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other essential products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach Palou safely, where they found refuge in tarpaulins spread out in the yard of their office, they have passed a number of scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba says.
“They told me they had seen countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, sending of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The disaster is still at a regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but since then they have not yet declared such a status.”
While Palu falls on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel reached the paragliding community, he was desperate to send messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue marks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
Thieves Raise $26,750 at Levi’s Newport ATM Charge
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from a Brink employee who had loaded an ATM in Levi’s Newport, it became clear from a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man "came running behind the back of the Brink employee" and stole a purse.
Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continued, but the police did not specify the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information about the suspects' identities should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been wearing the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change is ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons," the show's creator tells us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously argued that the word has religious significance for him.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible where it means ‘you’ or ‘you’,” West shared earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
It is you, it is us, it is us.
He passed from Cana, which means only one person, just to Him – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence.”
The rapper is one of the many famous in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and titles, including Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the aliases Leo and Brader Leo.
One of West's previous collaborators, J. Z., also presented himself in a variant with or without dashes and/or capitals in his nickname.
Mexico’s president vows not to use military force against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI development
As China becomes increasingly active on the artificial intelligence development front, the U.S. needs to double its research budget in this area, says AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various units of the U.S. government made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. generally does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become the number 1 innovation in AI by 2030.
“The doubling of the AI development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the U.S. and are about to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough coming from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies – Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon Lee University, he worked on an AI system that beat America’s most successful hotel player, then was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to the federal government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify the new visionaries.
“Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to earn government funding,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university lights to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think that AI doctors should be offered green cards automatically,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this week on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum himself, while a boycott campaign casts a shadow over whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The issue of the ballots reads as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-deceased Yugoslav state Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have decided that they will comply with the result of it to the point that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote for it.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the ballot boxes.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gyose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoritsa and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents, stretched by the boycotting referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants’ door,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, since unemployment in the country is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his own vote.
He also said that the positive result would lead to "affirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey, according to which between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, a case by Macedonian television Thelma, announced that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahime Sterling overcame Brighton's defence and brought Manchester City's 2-0 win to Saturday's Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He sneaked past one of the defenders, then left the others behind on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-footed shot over Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries to his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were planning to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal right now.”
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the “blues” in this match of the English Premier League.
He signed in the 29th minute.
In the situation of the goal, Aguero received a submission deep in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately released a detour on the left flank to Liroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The attacker of the "blue sky" managed to get a close shot, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
After the Nationals didn’t qualify for the playoffs, there’s no particular sense in another title-winning starting pitcher match.
And yet always the ambitious Chercer hopes to be the starter on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the game matters to the Rockies, who lead with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card game after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still not sure if they will win their first division title.
“Although we are not fighting for anything, we want to end the season with a nice game in Denver, where the public and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
“Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Chercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer, this would be his 34th starter pitcher game this year, with him training on Thursday and having a normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia.
President Koso hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in current history – I also state that although I am not a candidate, I am actually participating, which is why I am fighting with all my might for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this terrible, horrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain their power in any way, you yourself are witnesses to their ruthlessness, to their malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt, they don’t care who they have to run to get into power and government, because they’re only interested in power and government, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves the goal of “preventing and hindering.”
“What we’ve all seen in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong cheers from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the documents?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting – it was really a nasty gesture – maybe the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer broad-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour MP to be told he’s not welcome — just because I’m speaking frankly.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has taken a similar stance because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement at the time of previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said: “We wish the meetings to include everyone and be fruitful.”
For most of my eight years as a local representative of Labour in Parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a “lighter and more measured” policy have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda at all.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party leadership liked it.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before I thought they shared similar political views, started expecting me to turn around and take positions I would never agree with – be it on national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there is a whole offensive tirade in social networks, where there is a call for a recall, a rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to the Labour Party.
It doesn't just happen to me.
In the interests of truth, I know that I have even drawn more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are at least mostly political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist ridicule every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer broad-based, and with every sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice, it becomes increasingly narrow.
In the last two years I have received many advices to calm down, not to talk so much and that then "everything will be fine".
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher’s government, which by its neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political expulsion will prevent me from acting in the way that I consider to be in your best interest.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led in the standings
The two late essays may have changed the final score slightly, but there’s no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent Premier League game.
The team already leads the standings and the only one of the ten teams is without a loss so far.
The better defense and the better use of the opportunities were decisive in the match, which coach Peter Merci and his team can be very pleased with.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past games, and we're still without a loss," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their position better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute essay, followed by a successful extra punch by Frazier Klimo, brought Air forward in the score, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the score, after which Jessel failed to score.
Klimo increased the lead for Air by a penalty kick just before halftime, scoring an essay after a salt action, and then realizing the extra kick, which made the score 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Baggot, reduced the lead to just five points.
It was followed by a prolonged suspension of the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Not, who was carried out on a stretcher, and after the renewal of the game Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow by Klimo.
Then Air's acting captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and completing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed further strike.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent penalty play McPherson realized an essay using the advancing offensive line of the Air.
Klimo made the extra shot, and not long after did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and brought out the wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to have headed for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems to have headed for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, though a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan had intended to join Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s lack of access to the sea hopes the vessel will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors are constantly patrolling rigging at La Paz's naval headquarters.
Above the public buildings there is an ocean blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are embroidered with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as is the call to sail across the Pacific again.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, as Bolivia waits for a verdict by an international court on Oct. 1, after five years of deliberation.
“The strength is in Bolivia, there is a sense of chastity and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the international court’s sentencing on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will back Bolivia’s claim and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic local president, who is due to face a disputed re-election battle next year, also laid much and much to the court’s judgment on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean,” Morales said in August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court making a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small. At the same time, even if it judges in its favor, this would not change things in reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to take over Chile and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complex,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the Bolivian cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean was blown up by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales's warlike rhetoric had erased Chile's little remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct a normal dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia would have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile” and a chance to “stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides.”
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political crutch.”
“Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never engage in nuclear disarmament first if it was not able to trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposition countries in Singapore.
His comment comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting a stalemate on the nuclear issue more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri called “empty hope” that continuing U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture along the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about abandoning an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange preparations for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest cry of massive hats, which will soon be in the fashion stores near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block out the sun’s rays, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which rocked the fashion podium during Paris Fashion Week.
Pretty impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their eye-catching creations to rock the fashion community.
Valentino’s prominent proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a pen-like broad periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-decorated melons, a magic hat, and even pineapple — but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had mouths sewn and reminded not so much of high fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving gear in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like melted funicular ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after “La Bomba” – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearer dressed in a swimsuit.
The raffia bag in the color of a burnt orange, with raffia fringes and studded with a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection during Fashion Week in Paris.
Notorious stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another superb presentation of the test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in the sports, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compile and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words will get to them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that languages are at the first place with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of the students achieved grade A in Chinese, with the same score having 72% of the students studying German, 69% of the schools French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as subjects of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond them.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that, because of the reasons employers find it difficult to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language skills.
Therefore, more and more the mastery of foreign languages becomes mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require the mastery of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person mastered a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multi-lingual person one breast ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adult citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to practice a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reaches a two-digit rate of 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Learning several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child may have, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team's first pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is unclear how many minutes he will play in the match.
“He’ll be on the pitch in between one and 48 minutes,” Walton said via the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced on Twitter that James would likely play a relatively small number of minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers preseason preparation.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of pre-election rallies tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies that include stops at famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying a confirmatory vote on his election to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress at the November vote.
What time will the Trump rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia, below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, which have raised tensions over allegations of immoral sexual acts, holding the Senate’s affirmative vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is underway.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments," a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willing, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month will be on Saturday, where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who lags behind in sociological research.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions of no-nonsense "foursom" matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
“They led by six points, and now they’re only four, so I guess we’ve got a little bit of momentum,” Jordan said at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points with only twelve more to distribute.
However, as Spitt says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spitt shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers of the fans grew stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise stroke he equalized the result in the fourth match, after together with Thomas lag behind with two strokes after the first two holes.
His shot, which won them the match at the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” says Speet.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but awe-inspiring couple from Europe, won four out of four and it looks like they're getting everything.
Molewood were the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "gods" on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which energy seemed to pass between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, which will bring the potential victory of Europe as the sun sets for the National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the tales of European fame turned out to be a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball games while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
“Gods” and two “duals” of the first nine holes put the Spanish and the Swedish into problems that they were unable to cope with.
However, in Sunday matches, there is no one else to solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "foursom" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better on the team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of “foursom” matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe lead 10–6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the US 10–6 after playing in the four-ball and four-seater formats on Saturday.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, which increased their Le Golf National race asset by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn’s European team dominated the morning four-ball matches over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series 3–1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the Foursom games, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first newcomer from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to win four points of their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After unapologetically beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryan DeKambu with an even more categorical 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally showed outbursts of his genius, but so far there have been 19 losses out of 29 games in the four-ball and four-score games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who took a break for the morning four-ball games, teamed up with Henrik Stanson in the four-fights in a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coppa, number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2<0xC2><0xA7>1 victory against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the four-ball matches, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory MacLellroy 4&3 in the four-match series, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to catch up with a four-point deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, the Furik team will retain the trophy even in a draw.
However, after being beaten for two days in a row, it seems their chances of turning around on Sunday are not very high.
North Korea says there is "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen mistrust of the United States and there is no way the country could unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organization, Ri Yong-hou said that in the last year "significant measures of good will have been taken", for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the site for nuclear tests and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will there be a way to disarm unilaterally first.”
While Ree expressed North Korea’s well-known grievances about Washington’s resistance to a “staged” approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking phased measures, his statement seemed significant as it did not reject the one-sided predicate.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump gave the Sedona security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘removing nuclear weapons first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even objects to ‘the declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump is planned, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a point.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “evil president” Trump called Kim a “human-missile” of a suicide mine.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removes its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for doing so and said, “It doesn’t matter if it’s going to take two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament takes place."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea vowed to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the U.S. takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he is seeking are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year causes all students to sleep more in an attempt to overcome the growing culture of “all-night” learning with the help of caffeine.
A professor found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t even think about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaiser, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, prepared the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At last a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this only now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university has decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffer from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the bedtime routine.
Another part of the participants tells how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Professor Kaiser.
The culture of pride in “learning all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid fulfillment, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a mode of hunger, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaiser prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says his course has “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete such a curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaiser recommends students to think about whether to set a bedtime and wake-up alarm and know the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal crushed Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's idealess team and brought a 1–0 win to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest of triumph in February with a 4–1 win over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18 games as manager, leaving his team with eight points less to break away from the water.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas on the Rangers team at no point seemed close to a draw.
After the game, the Rangers clinched sixth place, and Livingston were already third, trailing the second Hibernian only by a goal difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingstone elf who scored a point against Harts last week, and should have been pleased with the way his aggressive team matched all of the opponent’s actions.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better on the rare occasions when they owned it.
They had to score in the second minute when Menga led with one touch Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later, Kagan Jacobs' centering foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Litgou deflected the ball away from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but were unable to create anything meaningful in the final third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought that there should be a penalty in the 15th minute when he faced Stephen Lawles, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two accurate shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily dealt a blow to Lasana Kulibali's head and a weak shot to Ovie Edzaria.
Although Livy’s 34th minute hit was surprising in terms of possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to a result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
However, Livingstone continued to force the guests to play in a style of play that was convenient for the hosts, with Lithgow and Halket continually knocking down the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs's blow, and with the ensuing corner, Litgou shot his head along the beam.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty at the end of the game after a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: Inventor of the Geiger counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado was released, featuring seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What, for God's sake, is this
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “It sure doesn’t matter right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Foreign Cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and be re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's Make America Great Again" while participating in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was seen in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that read “Let’s Make America Great Again,” he spoke out against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people very often and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL kicked off the show with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was huddled behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been harassed!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he will wear Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
The comments sparked at least two cheers from the audience and SNL team members looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them telling: “The whole studio shut down.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perrier".
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR MEETING THE WOLF."
The show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just himself and that's wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s what we are,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and is now "officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed the example of Didi, also known as Puff Dedi, Puffy and Paddy Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lyon, and the musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after knife-wielding in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the NGO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads young people to often think they need to be “rough” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his “Game of Thrones” partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels “firmly convinced” that this problem needs to be solved.
“Right now I’m firmly convinced – what did we do wrong in terms of masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach young men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel they have to become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, claiming that he had "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Keith will play a role in Sam Shepherd’s True West revival, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing that has happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and defined my life for the future,” he said.
Rose plays Gamer, the girl in which the character of Keith John Snow falls in love, in the fantasy series, winner of the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent jump in the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to the health services, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of spilling infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China’s health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican Party senators’ data, denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information of three U.S. senators from Republicans on the pages of lawmakers on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and “ultra-right wing” websites.
“Lies, lies and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and is an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“There is a poison in this denial,” wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to criticism from Democrats of Judge Cavano, who was accused by critics of looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“Essentially, if that’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had referred the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
"Johnny English Blows Again" Review: The Weak Spying Parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British-participated film and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will the self-loathing and mimicry that says how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes uprooted and a “human” face has the permission to repeat things a second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comic creation intended for movie fans who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims to flattery, owns a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean, and much of the man who contributed a note to the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the leaving chaos behind a traveler and an international man who Atkinson played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
In the last film with Johnny English there are either two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor and for a short time the feathers stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather weak and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy mishaps aren’t innovative and focused, as Actinson’s lack of play reminds Mr. Bean.
It is always a good thing that the UK is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked into Britain’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operatives for the agent’s horror – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a bloated and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Teresa-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she must call a retired agent, as all acting agents have been compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chic center, but illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for urgent instruction and reunites with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a hilarious role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Walta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farce: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for the virtual reality of the inn.
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since they are so cute and bubbly, there is a lot more content here for kids.
Quite a mediocre production.
As with the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four weeks but getting paid for five.
The party claims that it wants the heads of the companies to provide the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would “pass” the economic program and the party’s plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen immediately, but the four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day workweek is not in the party’s policy, it is not being considered.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to unveil his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from the “impersonal directors” and “speculators” at utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water utilities may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose “holdings” on the basis of established violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees, which can accumulate annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s investigation of Cavano could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau’s findings could cause some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Cavano.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavano and to change that, a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blassie Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive lineup of performers and carries out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the grand lawn in Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get to know the true purpose of the event – the removal of the exception.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending a non-email to a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise connecting in order to help raise awareness of the purpose of the event.
But how successful is “Global Citizen” 12 years before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – do people think they’re doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who insist on a variety of goals.
It says these actions have helped global leaders announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and communications stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the UK’s “Nutrition Force” partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to “helping children develop their full potential,” which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4 million tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historic note,” Food Force Ambassador Tracy Ulman told a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to a FAQ on his website, asking “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But as with the great civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year’s event in New York, which will feature Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces to “block” and impede energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink said.
Zink argues that Russia’s engagement in Syria – in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option in terms of Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement,” he said, while defining Russia as a “single-number pony,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says turns Berlin into a “hostage.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion pipeline on Nord Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which again confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country meddles in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Look Seriously at 2020 Presidential Nomination, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "take a serious look" at the presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women in Washington to come in and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy.”
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried to the bottom of my soul like Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological survey conducted on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out the PTSD of Trak Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after I return is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other veterans of the war that "they come back a little changed, entrenched, come back and wonder if they will get the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila’s police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the county filed a goodwill petition in Washington in support of asylum-seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner “and the sons of his gang’s brutal members” abused her, but U.S. officials turned down the asylum application on July 20.
She's been detained in Texas.
U.S. attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as nations facing comprehensive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy brought back the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Refugees are granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in a July 11 message about the policy.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate Rescue Efforts in Palu as Deaths Double During Search for Survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try and save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwayne Harris, who suffered a fracture to his back and shoulder, were accommodated outside Army Hospital in Palo Alto, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes fill with tears as he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the broken wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after he accused China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they are leveling import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the US and China at the start of the trade war, tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is currently doubling this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by running paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a true reflection of the misguided views that the Chinese people may have regarding China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With the pogrom of Kavanaugh, Republicans Reject Women Voters for Midterm Elections, Analysts Warn
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh over several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the tray are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be put back," Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasy Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be ruled out,” said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say the problem is already serious; that’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that a backlash may follow if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more inclined toward the latter.
A new sociological survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals while they were at a party during her Yale follow-up in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has launched an initiative that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of the venture.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, which are accessible through any browser, and at the same time are all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “giving authority to personal data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all of their business models are completely updated overnight.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence on the net neutrality debate.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era on the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
It marks 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his involvement in World War I fighting.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain’s highest military honors.
A memorial was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the monument would be found exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very dense fog and under heavy shelling by artillery and machine guns."
He later attacked the line of fire and, with “incredible courage,” led the pack forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me feel calm.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van put on a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to be in the parade" and added "the virtue of the real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you are waiting all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can not witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six from the main map, and was to be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Geghard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being built up to the early hours, especially because of the match.
Fan described on Twitter the switch to the children's animated film as a "sick joke".
“The government regulated that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so the program was replaced with a children’s show,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig," yes.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said he would work on scheduling the meetings to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, when it comes to repetition, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“However, it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that the event takes place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to including five games instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we overdid.
This is an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Lower” Due to His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lawrence, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, is in the hospital for a few months.
While participating in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy to be able to live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire the “hope” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man — American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — he was “surprised.”
Daly married Oscar-winning actor who was 20 years older than him last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he first competed at the Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says that "his whole worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I’m only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be next to me, Dad, not on the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that all my life I’d dreamed of jumping at the Olympics in front of an audience at home. There was no more terrible feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him shudder.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British Summer Time.
The lost form Mikkelson remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be tied with failure.
Michelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furrick for the four-ball and four-sem games on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time major tournament winner spent his day as a fan and in training his punches from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old, who even at the peak of his career has never been among the straightest players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult Le Golf National course, where the long uneven course usually punishes every wrong stroke.
And if the pitch itself isn’t disturbing enough, in Sunday’s ninth game, Michelson will face British Open precision champion Francesco Molinari, who is on a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and is looking to win all four of his games this week.
If the Americans, who lag behind by four points before the 12th singles game, make a strong start, it may turn out that Michelson’s match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly say anything much different.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he’d play just two games.
I expected him to play more, but that’s just how it turned out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most games in the Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been closer to his impressive individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for any team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big lead could soon be melted
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage gained before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dutchman made his debut in the game of Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Sevé Balisteros led with five points in front of the Americans, but exactly in the finals he was almost caught and barely managed to hold the victory with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at the Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but it was very difficult,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn said after the 2018 European team won with a 10–3 lead at the same time.
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is finished until you see the final result on the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is exactly what we need to stay focused on.
“All the time I’ve said that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we’re also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the players’ performance on a difficult golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn added: “I would never rush into the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performances will come out in the foreground and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you go out alone, then you’re putting all your golfing capacity to the test.
This is the message you need to get to the players: tomorrow you need to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, because he too has to give up to the end."
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being only Jordan Speet and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of those big backs on the last day – he was part of Brookline’s triumph, and then he was on the losing side when Europeans performed The Miracle of Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on Brookline as well as on Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous tension.
That's why we formed our squad and distributed our boys as we wanted to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I picked these players in this order because I think it gives us the best chance of success,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn said of his singles selection.
Germany has postponed the launch of a new warship.
The German Navy’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war warships, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s leading ship of new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes an army spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to home ports.
However, the continuous delays mean that state-of-the-art warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will be old by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that render the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the naval forces to add future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) out of the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the fleet was actually "depleting from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem has become bigger over time as the old ships have been decommissioned but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at a property in the Scottish mountains, aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow common bats as well as brown arrow-eared water-nighters at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations in the estate to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of callous sounds of bats, as well as what types they emit.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by any species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk from construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
There may be a risk to populations from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only special bat reserve at the Threeave estate in the Dumfries and Galway area, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The estate’s manager, David Thompson, says it’s an ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threeave, we have a great field for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of mature trees and a completed suitable habitat.
But there are many more things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, since it is possible to unintentionally destroy one shelter to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish employee at the Bat Protection Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Claims and His Lawyers Will Judge German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news”, saying that people “want to become famous” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes these allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the publication as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to build popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "inadmissible publication of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "good guy" at "99 percent", but in this case he simply gave in to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified by revenge" and worried that she would not be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the amount of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' that it has lost automakers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnastone, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delaying the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnastone, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director in Burnastone.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border problems, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to complete its inventory at the Darbysher plant, the company said, and production will therefore stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's "chessmate" plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio's 4's Today programme.
“Following the claims not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota can’t say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and is the founder of the union Unite at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: “From my experience, I judge that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have laid out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor or not, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Fore.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI into complaints against Cavano, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is still no date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed until next week.
But we’ll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not due to distaste for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he shared: "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is conducting more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, citing no evidence.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and you have seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers at the National Health Service of Scotland in relation to the fears related to Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and willingness to remain in place after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to recall how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and this is for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love to have you stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie has had an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury during Saturday's match, when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury had occurred just before halftime.
“He went to the sideline and somehow just fell over there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel supplied oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the dressing room for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details about the type/seriousness of the injury,” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a freshman with a college scholarship, is in for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax when buying real estate in the UK
Under new plans by the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury is expecting an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision to foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will help the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is in addition to the current coat of arms tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of giving away – can amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are bought by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to interfere in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by robbing land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “hoard of housing.”
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent control and the end of “no-fault” expulsions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always have open doors for those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy housing as easily as hard-working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead the team in Scotland’
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said the "biggest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the club from north-east England, which is currently in third place in the First League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after last season he brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team and that’s all,” Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the matches of Scotland at Hampton, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
“But this opportunity would only open if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Advocaat, David Moses, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic’s former mentor said he was not concerned as a successor to such well-established names in such a famous club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success right now will be measured by a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back into the Premier League?’
Because by structure, base and conditions it is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back to the top level of football, but I will accept that I have only achieved success here if I can get the team back out there.”
Ross has been a manager for just three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa avoid falling into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from a falling team into a Champions League winner the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his football career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Académie.
“I was really at the crossroads,” he remembers the time he took Aloa.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, made good money and had some significant successes.
Being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life.”

The ideal time for a beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat has increased the incomes of struggling British pubs, but it has built up more tension for restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged sunshine and longer than England’s expected World Cup participation, a similar pattern followed in July when pubs saw an increase of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received more.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and beverage bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Pubs with meals also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to ongoing costs.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food-service managers, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired break.”
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret social media profile from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have a secret social media profile they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has found.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” profile that they show to their parents.
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a social media profile that keeps it a secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean “basic” profile that they show to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of independent schools found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they keep their profiles secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on Scotland's Athletics Board
Eileen Doyle was elected to join the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director of the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has identified this move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her wealth of international experience over the past decade.
“Eylid enjoys tremendous respect in the athletics communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from attracting her,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter finals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, adding to a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after receiving a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows, share online opinions
A company that produces breast pumps has divided online opinions with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows who are breastfeeding.
To mark the launch of the expected “world’s first noiseless breast pump suitable for carrying”, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a humorous music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to infants to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack full of hay on the background of a song with lyrics that include, “Yes, I’m breastfeeding, but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not vimeo, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, breastfeed my girlfriends."
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth.”

Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “So inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "extremely funny".
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who give up (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly assembles in a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they are being squeezed.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfed and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been in the mainstream news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Yakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has skyrocketed, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be accommodated with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, and this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either guardians or are members of the guardians’ family reside illegally in the country, with a large proportion of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to persecute these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference call, rather than in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are determined to be unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving the children to the “tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could compound the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation troops” to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualeem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be taken appropriate action".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed" by both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners."
The U.S. has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian sides, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing “some Western countries of ‘blowing up groundless fears’ that push refugees to stay away.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in these returns,” he said.
“They’re turning into a political issue, which is a completely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provided an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Mualeem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will be directed at the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front, who "will be destroyed."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition soon to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem laid out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Under this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of weariness of the audience.
Since 2014, the primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the cable ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at major news evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama “The Last Candidate,” which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Neil Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scovel told me that he replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else shown on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Rowe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, the desire to be an informed citizen doesn’t match that at six o’clock to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as a source for his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s ostrich-skinned jacket for $15,000 (“the dress with a rag”).
I especially will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing to make you feel like part of a reality show is giving you a little bit every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in regards to the changing participants and the daily turnaround of the game.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Flyes this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees, on the north coast of Kauai, but he had shut himself up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be separated from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments are pouring into the most contested race in the early elections for a seat in Congress
Not surprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania received a stream of money, thanks to the rearrangement of congressional districts and hence two holders for the same place.
Recently, a redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh named Conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is significantly behind the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the parties' main funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated March by-election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The U.S. has considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, after which it withdrew.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only envisaged against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million US dollars in aid from the United States for the fight against drugs, with the aim of development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including a cut in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state with its unemployment rate and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which served as a continuation of a similar gathering last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent inflows of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior management had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will attend the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, with the report currently being a significant piece of evidence in the public record.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during their campaign against our election.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body just as he prepares to face the voters, as well as perhaps to court judges composed by his colleagues.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I’m not suggesting that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor is that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are facing a number of similar challenges right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly write down the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the story in The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move ahead of Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from playing his first game of the season before the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
“We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game in the hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality looks like a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We took a look at Thursday, another great night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened in my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to be heading in the right direction.
The team is good and the guys really have fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to use all our strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women Are Worried About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken the steps to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t state your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover those expenses or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles right from the start.
Appoint a health care representative so that you have a designated trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the idea of a financial affairs officer.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is traveling to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Explain these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s also about who the doctors will be,” Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to interrupted communications, aid organizations cannot receive information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's 7.5-magnitude epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the shoreline of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly battered by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26 on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, activating a tsunami that crashed off the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake toppled one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong tremors rocked the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on rape charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in domestic violence reporting, and resistance to arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Police published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-detention building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, for sure" when asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin is threatened with punishment for three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he can be deprived of his liberty for up to a year and pay a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involvement in reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotic drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people have died in an earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are rotated, which show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented truck at Home Depot to carry out the October attack on the bike lane near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, stomping pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the death penalty claim filed in the Southern District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end in a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal judiciary filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight racketeering-related murder charges routinely used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of the ICC.
The attack required "serious planning and intentionality," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "terrible, cruel and perverse."
Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Feluzzi and Alejandro Damian Panuko.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's Southern District sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York City was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple, were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked his hospital room to set the flag of ISIL, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Talks <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” – as one of Theresa May’s own party members suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain “would have left by now” if Mr Farage had been secretary of state for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile with the deeply divided ranks of the party was underscored by conservatives who supported staying and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the EU.
The allies insist that it will make progress in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and urge Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bon told protesters with the slogan “Getting out means getting out” in Solihull that he wanted to “throw away Chequers.”
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have participated on an equal basis with the others and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to abandon the Chequers plan.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be slavish.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bon rejected the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Representative Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please download "Chequers" and start listening.
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “Premiers retain their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit and we’re gathered here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let this pass you by.’
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists raised flags with the words “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for security concerns about the party’s application when it opened at the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all of Canada’s technology and more, and more, for unimpeded border crossing, for free borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says he will "consider seriously" his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “consider seriously the possibility of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city council meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take over as Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is high time that “women go to Washington and fix our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested for the death of Sims by LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday when basketball player Wade Simms was killed by LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death,” Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and detained in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 games per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's guidance helped him beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Waltery Bottas finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Fethel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out after Fethel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him on the third lap after a daring maneuver and driving "rubber to rubber", which forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to release the inner part of the track to avoid a lap time.
Above his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led through a fairly long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overtake Kimi Raikonen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally made a pit-stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raikonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, as Valtteri did a great job all weekend and showed up as a real gentleman when he let me get ahead of him.
The team did an outstanding job to win the first two places on the podium,” Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she did not distribute the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses Supreme Court contender Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and dishonest.”
“What can happen to the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil people, and disgusting and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you know each other?
Diane Feinstein, did it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t spread it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... No, we didn’t spread,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September — but Feinstein denies that the spread had occurred from her office.
“I have not covered up Ford’s claims, I have not spread her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep my privacy and I kept my privacy as she wished.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night’s rally: “I will tell you that this was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court’s contender accused of sex crimes against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power by all possible means.
Look at the dishonor, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain their power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars bounced back for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants, beating Dundee 5-3 in a rematch on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney lined up for the hosts before Dwyer regained the lead on Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard leveled for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third Elite League win for Adam Keef's boys, who slipped from the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The kick with which Dwyer found the score came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the lead by assisting Bowier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level up with the help of Kauny at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to lead the Giants before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again leveled the odds with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time at the end of the second half, as he gave his all and cemented the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who have lost the last four games out of a total of five games, host Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant was killed to make sure that hundreds of people on board a plane could escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, activating a tsunami wave.
Strong secondary tremors continued to strike the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country’s disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
“We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's looting all over the minimarkets."
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is in the unknown after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after it said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon they can not contact a male passenger.
The airline added that it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in its efforts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of locals helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was over the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
“It’s very nice,” Janes says.
Janes says that he and the others managed to run through the deep water to the cross to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a mild head injury.
U.S. naval forces say sailors repairing a nearby harbor also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank into the deep, about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Safe Air Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyzer exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis had been with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Telis said she knew Chambers from two weeks before her death.
Mobile phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis had deleted text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the judges later the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke negative opinions about the genre by performing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has deviated from its origins in political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate conscientious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York woman is suing a couple after being fired for a “racist” message.
A New York mother-in-law is suing a couple for dismissal over discrimination after she received a wrongly sent message from her mother, who complains that she is “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, describing their desire for “extortion.”
Linzi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was stunned to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day at work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEE, ORDINARY BLACK SKIN", wrote in a text message Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, noting that the previous nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one working day then sent home by taxi.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the redundancy, asking for $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, even though she didn’t have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure it’s discrimination.”
In response to the lawsuit, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that Morris’s termination of employment was a reasonable action, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
“Think about it.”
Plasco claimed that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still in the process of being considered, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Would Not Have Felt a Connection with a Talking Bear, New Letter Reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It's a lot of fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, would feel optimistic about the eventual rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with a smile".
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father had secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and he wasn’t self-deprecating,” she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who’s achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your thing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“He kept ringing to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Nad then called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines given to her by the doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She's been gone a while before, and that's how it all ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, realising that all of this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get up.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who is still grieving the loss of her daughter, boards the plane with the other passengers who have no idea of the test she is going through.
“Nobody understood,” she said.
“I had put my head on and all the time my tears were dripping.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-consuming sense of empathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women put up cards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened every room.
However, he gave up his job before he left and found himself in a “really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis shared, “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards “to let people know there’s someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens up a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question after FBI begins investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants – a limited-duration, limited-range investigation – maybe we could join forces,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “break apart” despite the hard-won extra-party blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Cavano and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the moment itself.
The early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans do not perform well, they will seriously hurt their attempts to be elected their representative in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators inviting them to support Mr. Cavano, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House, and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea “declined” under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, citing data from the South Korean ministry of unification, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually gained citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and cross more easily than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalling negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way I wouldn't have thought that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and feeling emotional when discussing his family and his student years.
He also strongly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a "gross and coordinated attack on the individual" organized by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's eyewitness testimony showed he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because it became clear he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he persecutes the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Cavano if he was appointed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it like that – if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s ineligible not only to go to the Supreme Court, but to the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it great?’”
And women need to be able to control themselves.
This is a reasonable criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she can not accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got a huge help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who shared that she too cries when she gets angry, but has developed her technique, thanks to which when she gets angry and cries, she says to her interlocutor, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the clearest memories of my previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, as I blinked with inexpressible rage, an older woman caught me by the neck – a chilling manager I’ve always been a little afraid of – and she dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they did it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called the "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to have another one.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
As she joined the campaign late, she lagged behind in fundraising and decided she would not stay in the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
The battle is predestined to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would give only $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was filled with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and to be able to address voters, not delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
“One might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a gap between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning bell this year, taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of production (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) with effective taxation on half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with new tariffs of five to ten percent of U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. strike and soon the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore it.
To make Washington give up is to submit to the demands, but to bow headlong in public before Washington would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a senior research fellow at the Asian security group.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by the war that has lasted more than seven years.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by the terrorists to bring them back to their normal state.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or assistance would be accepted from states that had financed the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has had six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reached the necessary 14.5 points, which guaranteed victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michelson, who performed poorly throughout most of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "pair" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed well in all rounds, becoming one of only four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the competition was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Speet lost strongly with 5&4 of the player in the team of Europe, located in the lowest place in the ranking – Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this was probably the last appearance of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in the Ryder Cup, became the European with the most points earned in the tournament for all time, increasing his asset to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for inviting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the cup again.
In everything, the most important is the team and I am happy that I was able to help," said excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play,” said Ram, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and his overall balance of the Ryder Cup is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator on which he concedes only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furik said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we put pressure on the European team.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our Riders’ Cup Committee, and look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overjoyed.”
New for the red tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manotti and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee shows a fundamental reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for curtailment of growth in the areas of the districts of Pinelas, Manotti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
The watersheds with excessive blooming of the red tide extend approximately 130 miles along the coast, from the northern district of Pinelas to the southern district of Lee.
Algal deposits can be seen 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but are less than they were last week.
A red tide is also seen in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or a little further inland in the county of Pinelas, low to high concentrations in the county of Hillsborough, high concentrations in the county of Manoti, high concentrations in the county of Pinelas, or high concentrations in the county of Pinelas.
Inflammation of the airways in Pinelas, Manotti, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties continues to be reported.
