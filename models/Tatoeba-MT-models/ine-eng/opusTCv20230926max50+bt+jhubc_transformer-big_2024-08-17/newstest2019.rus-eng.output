Named the number of new recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People’s Police of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass.
According to him, thus, Kiev plans "at least somehow to complete the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing of units," Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called to the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the United Forces (UFO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.
US authorities have forced Mask to leave the post of chairman of the board of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows Musk to remain in the lead position at Tesla.
At the same time, he must pay $20 million and leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for not less than three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mask of misleading shareholders with a statement that there were sufficient funds for the redemption of the company's shares and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
It is about the publication of a businessman on Twitter, where he stated his desire to buy Tesla shares for $420 apiece, but did not do so.
After Twitter, the shares of the company grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of seizing members of the European Union.
With such a statement, the diplomat spoke at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” he said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit negotiations had come to a standstill.
So she commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The United Kingdom is expected to exit by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the Irish border issue remains open.

Telegram users complained about a failure in the work of the new version
iPhone users have complained about problems in the work of the Telegram messenger after the update, which was released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by its username
The complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
The messenger's representatives responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be due to the migration of information to a new app written in Swift language.
Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app before troubleshooting.
On April 13, Moscow’s Tagansky court upheld Roskomnadzor’s claim to block Telegram’s messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the user’s IP address and mobile phone number when receiving a relevant court ruling.
Telegram audience after the blockade in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk forced to step down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of head of Tesla.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be sought from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is on Forbes magazine’s list of the 50 richest people on the planet.
He is the head of the SpaceX space corporation, the neurotech company Neuralink and the developer of electric cars Tesla, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and redeem all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was reportedly set “because of the significance of this number in marijuana culture,” Bloomberg reported earlier, citing Stephen Peikin, the commission’s co-director of security.
Elon Musk later refused his plans to buy back the stock.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considers the fraud allegations unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn’t break it in any way,” he told CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Mask, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman’s posts caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, due to which Tesla stock sellers were forced to buy papers at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk’s careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk was accused of stock market fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk were unable to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be threatened with removal from the company’s management and even jail.
This, in particular, was announced to CNBC by former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is a “good guy who doesn’t know how to run a car company.”

In the ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (OVCC) of the Moscow Patriarchate Metropolitan Hilarion Volokolamsky compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, a possible church split and its political subtext
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage", to rename the church - just like in fascist Germany "to tie the Jews a yellow hexagonal star".
"This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Russian TV channel Russia 24.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because “believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.”
UOC urged Constantinople exarchs to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: the auction, the Russian car and the return of Quita
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said this, summarizing the meeting with Russian car manufacturers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared the opinion about Daniel Kvyat’s return to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian Formula 1 stage.
The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of the Russian car "Formula-1", which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I don’t think that’s possible at such a time.
I think the more realistic timelines are for the next ten years.”
From 2012 to 2014 in "Formula 1" under the Russian license was performed by the team "Marusya".
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship in the Formula 1 class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motorsport, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let’s hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, including because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi.”
Tomorrow, Sochi Autodrom is expecting an auction.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the stands were almost filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will give even greater appeal to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak did not pass and the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport fans is the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success in the next season,” the Deputy Prime Minister told Izvestia.
He's a hopeful racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 race.
Although the further fate of Sergey Syrotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took the 18th place in the Russian Grand Prix qualification.
We hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, the Paris newspapers wrote: “To defeat fascism and liberate France he made more than a dozen divisions.”
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.

By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all about this.

Trump talks about ‘love’ with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and North Korea have come almost to falling in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
U.S. President Donald Trump noted a successful joke about his successes on the frontline of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The White House official recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem as a major complication in foreign policy from the previous administration.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team launched relations with North Korea so much that it could not even reach the country’s leadership – they simply did not remove the phone there.
At the time, the US and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, "was cruel" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders “fell in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that recently, Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is also closing military sites.
All these are the merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump made a mockery of Kim Jong-un from the podium of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the moment of complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Talks in Singapore

The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are being taken.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangster”.

Nitsoy called for the ousting of “Moscow language with Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children’s writer and native-language purity fighter Larisa Nicea called for the expulsion of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do this, she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
With her thoughts on "the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" Nicea shared with the Ukrainian edition "Obzrevatel".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “heal” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, before on television and radio, Russian speech was widely used, but in public space it was practically not left.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "enlargement of the borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nicea shared the experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons bookstores, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Without achieving her goal, Nicea threw in the girl's surrender.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently, Nicea said that the name "Rus" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.
In the break held a man's conversation, and it brought its fruits
Ural defender Denis Kulakov about the victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Denise, what do you think made you win?"
"It seems to me that we wanted to win more," the official Urals website quoted Kulakov as saying.
“Such a difficult game turned out to be, in the break held a serious male conversation, and it brought its fruits: scored two balls and did not miss.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you received at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?”
“If you’ve lasted 90 minutes, that’s fine.
Actually, it felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day it took a little bit of strength to make sure nothing happened.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
“It is no secret that after winning and recovering easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans.”
"Did you miss the game when you didn't get on the field?"
“There is such a thing, a little bit missed, because really, the unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting you on your feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

A corresponding statement was made by the Serbian leader during a press conference, reports the local newspaper "Vecernie noviny".
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, speaking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support on the example of Syria.
Alexander Vucic said that he does not want to allow a scenario in which there may be some major military clashes on the territory of the state.
The president of the country promised to make every effort to preserve the peace, the publication reports.
According to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for next Tuesday, October 2, writes Lenta.ru.
The day before, it became known that the Serbian president had brought the state army into full combat readiness because of the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory, which is adjacent to the lake, which supplies water to the hydropower station "Gazivode".
It is specified that the specified hydroelectric power plant is located in the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to admit it.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually absent in the negative
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric that we have become almost accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more muted,” the senator said in an interview published Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "denoted as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with the Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which in this regard was quite unanimous".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that "the topic of Russia in the negative was practically absent."
“If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the chorus was not absolutely accurate,” – said the politician, noting that Russia “was no longer a wall, a mesad, about which is being trained”.
The head of the profile committee of the Sovfed does not exclude that this indicates some trend that, in his opinion, “will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although to the full extent this trend may appear in a year, in two, three”.
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," - admitted Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how with the connection of Russia manages to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," he added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is “adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible – an integral participant in solving the global problems of today”.
“I wouldn’t want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we’re going somewhere where the movement is no longer going backwards, it’s going to be going forward,” he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “the demand for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, was largely of interest to him.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "in the so-called new liberal order, which is represented by problems with the West, there are no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve problems of the Middle East, the problems of the non-nuclear
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he considers the current session "successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

In Damascus declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the head of the Foreign Ministry of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
According to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of the militants of the Russian banned organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The head of the Foreign Ministry also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in the case of the Kurds' desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.

Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, are starving, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners, and the illegal release of Kherem.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us “worse, tougher in protecting Ukraine’s national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil.”

On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
Russian inmates satisfied the Ukrainian’s last request before his transfer to the colony.

Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze has admitted that he is only alive because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
“It’s as if I’ve been hit by a hammer on my skull.
I fell.
I've lost my orientation.
They put him in the hospital.

But the wife of the actor did not allow to bury a living actor, she firmly believed that she could cope with the disease and for more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.

The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennadiy Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":
As part of the general sexual education of children, this should be done, explaining the loss, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes quite early, and then there are large scissors between their sexual maturation and the opportunity to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "shame", the silencing of the "gender age problem" and the lack of a culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are faced with masturbation.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
Apparently, the inhabitants of Germany began to get seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, thanks to which the country became a desirable destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent social questions, according to which the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AdG broke another record, rising to the second place in the rating of popular sympathies.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popular vote, managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one-percentage point gap can be attributed to statistical error, but it is important to note the fact that the ADG created in 2013 by a small group of Eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
The overall leadership has so far retained the ruling bloc of the CSU/CSU, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, Angela Merkel's support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The Evolution of “Alternatives”
The Alternative for Germany party was created in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but at first only dealt with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the EU's weak economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German brand and the country's complete withdrawal from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of Eurosceptics and began to sharply criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" received seats in the European Parliament.
A video was posted with a journalist who called citizens of Ukraine "the nation of the Bolvans"
Head of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books Ostap Drozdov on live TV admitted that he considers his compatriots "the nation of the Bolvans".
They believe in television and read very little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We haven’t been inoculated with a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” he said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight literature, which contains the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

Named after the death of the universe
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
A study by an international team of scientists has been placed in the arXiv.org e-print library and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Scientists have come to similar conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope.
Tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, the scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model <0xCE><0x9B>CDM (<0xCE><0x9B> Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
According to a press release from Subaru Observatory, the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of data by the European Planck Space Telescope specified the limitations imposed on the parameters of the <0xCE><0x9B>CDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments in favor of the observed world ending its existence 22 billion years later as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
The opportunity to know the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow on Saturday held a meeting of the general federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of issues (in total, five formulations were registered by the Central Electoral Commission).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Do you want the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, after which Russian citizens receive the right to retirement pension, not increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally binding.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of the “Just Russia” Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend, and who is an enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbin's mistakes broke, as from the horn of abundance
The former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and discussed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the referee Evgenia Turbina in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his inadequacy to the referee of matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the efforts at the meeting of the fifth round of Spartak - Dynamo, neither Turbin himself nor the leaders of DSI have made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rude receptions collapsed like from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder falls with his hands in his penalty area defender "Ahmata" Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put penalties.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idova, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball fell into his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbine was near the moment, well sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and the penalty was not awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice turned out to be trumped up.
It was the same case when the referee by concept ousted and buried the sport spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not decide to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did I have to show you the second one?
- At this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of the judiciary that some teams are penalized for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and some are not.
What do you think of the football player’s words?
- Seeing what's meant by double standards.
There were penalties.
They didn't.
Therefore, the arbitrator does not give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee watches who plays.
Here played on Saturday "Lokomotiv" and "Ahmat" has serious claims to the work of Turbin, because the team was violated.
Matt Damon played the accused in the rape of Judge Kavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
A candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and the detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Cavano has repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but stated that he never got drunk before in his memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanaugh stated that he was a virgin at the time.
These moments also defeated Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with this,” said Matt Damon, a judge.
Kavanaugh was previously elected as the U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
Barbra Streisand has discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs.
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone the soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cotton-tolerant dog named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, which was named the world’s smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. contemplates Russian naval blockade over oil and gas supplies
In the United States, they can start a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. government is so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that it is ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s leading suppliers of energy.
The possibility of a naval blockade was told the day before by the head of the U.S. Interior Ministry, Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior performs not police, but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's application came within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to U.S. naval forces, they control sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the activation of Moscow in this region, Zinke said.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia Race
In Russia there is a club that I follow.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I’ve been following it for quite some time now and it was interesting to look at it from the side.
“I can’t say I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a lot of sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize once again for the decision,” he said.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" placed on the fifth line, having in the asset 15 points.
In the next round, the red and white on October 7 will play with Enisey, and the wards of Valeria Karpina will host Orenburg the day before.
Expensive violin was given to the pawnshop for a priceless
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, for an old and unrepresentable instrument, a pawn shop worker offered only $50.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and turned to an expert for advice.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250,000 dollars.
Only strings to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was stolen not so long ago from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who put it in the pawnshop, but it does not include any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL is waiting for us an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will host at his stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valeriy Karpin - a man, as you know, not a foreign "people's team".
The peculiarity of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lag behind the far-jumping "Zenit" and being in one point from "Krasnodar", which tomorrow plays with "Dynamo".
Red and white now have a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League team Massimo Carrera suddenly flew "Rapid", and recently gave up at home "Ahmata".
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartak" with a minimum score and not without difficulty defeated in the Cup "Chernomorets", and so far it is early to talk about whether the most popular club in Russia has approached the exit from the crisis.
“Rostov” could not win three matches in a row, but does not know the defeats already five games.
Let's see if Karpina will be able to extend the losing series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting of the Carpathian "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 7:00.

London has opened up about accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, UK Defence Minister Gavin Williamson has said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, the enemies are acting in gray areas using cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Foreign Ministry Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned a poisoning story in the English city of Salisbury in March this year by former GRU Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to the change of the country's name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first was voted by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of the renaming of the republic into North Macedonia.
International organizations are watching the preparations for the referendum and today's vote.
Jan Petersen, head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
About 100 teams have traveled the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then counting votes and drafting protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgery: “About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of the election commissions to then present them in the final report.
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
About it on the International Day of Translators, September 30, said professional translator-synchronist Barbel Saxe.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
“The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, ‘have been pushing for a long time to go fast.’
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role," the expert said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany makes no sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
Earlier in the day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to “establish relations” with Russia and support them.
According to her, for Berlin mania is particularly important the project of the gas pipeline "North Stream - 2", which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Comedy "Evening School" headed the American box office
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $ 28 million for its first weekend in rental.

In the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, has collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line of Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, quite noticeable, was preceded by another newcomer of the Western lease - the cartoon "Smolfoot", a curious story of the charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reissig, grossed $23 million over its opening weekend, generally acknowledging the expectations of experts predicting a tape of $20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total fees of “Smolfut”, at the moment they amount to $38.6 million (at the same time he debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the cash of the film by 3.6 million.
Three of the strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "The secret of the house with the clock" from the master of horrors Elaya Roth, finally proving that the director knows how to make high-quality cinema and for an audience of 12+.

Spin-off "Sorrow" in the results of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has on its account $ 330 million total earnings and recently proudly wears the title of the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "Sorrow" and two tapes about the terrible curse.
Directly following the horror of Corinna Hardy at the end of last weekend was another representative of the genre - debutant "Hellfest", one of the main youth horrors of the year.
In her first weekend child of the famous editor (and with the recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked on a number of major horror projects, including Happy Death Day, which Hellfest looks a lot like in places, earned in the United States $5.1 million.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh are the "Insanely Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who seem to not think to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for the seventh week, at the end of September is the sixth in the rating of the most box office of the genre for the whole.

The head coach of "Vitazya" Valeriy Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"The colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to note our fans," Belov said on the official website of Vityazya.
“Hopefully they will support as well, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, God probably helped Siberia today, because they made a very grave mistake, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the micro-match 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
Because they seem to have missed something in preparation.
“Compared to last game, it was a different team.”
"It's an ugly cowardice"
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "immodest gossip and brazen gossip".
When in blind auditions he learned the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings took over, and he chose a relative for his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor the inobjectivity in the first stage.
But the "joke" took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers absolutely unjustifiably.
And now the audience is no longer ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the cowardice of the ugly and frank dragging of their close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina will have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end of the first place," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina discussed in the program "The Man from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "melted" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the audience still want to see his father on the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the Voice members of Agutin's team - they were doomed."
“Last time, Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional.”
“The competition has lost its meaning.”
"Delete from the project two talented people and leave in the project his dad who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?",
“He likes to sing like a dad, give him a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
“From Agutin’s side, it was unprofessional.”
“Then we should offer to perform on our own show to the Pope, and not on a show that is made for the money of Channel 1.”
“It was a real opportunity for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merge, and Pope Agutin was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
“Don’t go through the cooking!”
“What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Round the swamps and cobblestones.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of absurdity continues!”
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind auditions the son of Gradsky came out.
Then the meter and the head did not come to take the son in his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

The scientist told about a possible scientific program of the Russian expedition to the moon
The head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a correspondent member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is engaged in the development of directions of such works.
“There is no consolidated opinion yet,” the scientist stressed.
He noted that one of the options is the placement of a low-frequency radio telescope on the reverse side of the Moon, which would avoid interference, the source of which is the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space radio emission sources," Petrovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used for testing robotics, using local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be attracted to the search for primitive organics on the satellite of the Earth, according to the scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version, the Russian Federation can make a manned flight to the moon by 2030.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotkin: I could not do anything, and it was very painful
Russian Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second lap I was between the two cars, which immediately caught me.
I lost all the positions that I played at the start, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
Trapped in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us got to the pit stop, we would get into the clean air and the pace would come back, but the rubbers were gone.
Plus, he was fighting with his partner, and he was in contact with him, too.
I understand he was a little bit wrong.
We were in this situation on the most unbeaten track of the season, I couldn’t do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” RIA Novosti quoted Syrotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Grand Prix of Russia finished 18th, the winner was the British driver "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the basis of "Spartak" absurd
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of the players of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko from training with the main team after a mock to the criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unworldly stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
It doesn’t serve the team’s normal climate.
Today, Spartacus has no game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
"Spartak" has a lot of problems in different lines, there is incompatibility after the introduction into the composition of the youth.
Relations within the team do not seem to add optimism before this match," Tarpishchev said.
The game of two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously rejected Spartacus, led Chelsea's youth team.
"Sirius" students discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Students of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Environmental Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film “Kody Kurchatov”, during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, a correspondent member of the RAS Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist was published on the website of Sirius.
The students learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, which are currently being worked on by young scientists.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also told about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal good.
This is an explosive growth of medical technology, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of the systems of living nature.
There is a flip side - a targeted intervention in the life of a person.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
The cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction,” REN TV quoted him as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physico-mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-natural-like technologies of the National Institute "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakov and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was established by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security “Cyber Challenges” will be sent to training in “Sirius”.

This was stated by US Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, reports "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.

But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the turnout on Sunday plebiscites "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change of the name of the republic, said that if among the submitted votes there will be more "yes", then Macedonia will change the name, despite the quorum not reached.

Kemerovchan outraged a herd of rams in the cemetery
On September 30 on the well-known Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from the eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries is free to walk horned animals.
The animals walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of the cemetery of small cattle there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory from weeds and grass weeds, but some of the inhabitants of the city the behavior of animals was not bad:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the rams to do there.
About the rams, of course, you will not say that they are gnawing, but still this is not the case" (the style is preserved) - noted in her message an outraged Kemerovchanka.
Either way, one of the witnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
To push and to reach - how right?
There are no words to push.
That's right, overtime.
The word “pressure” in the sense of “weight, influence, influence” exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “enough”.
We use this word, believing it comes from the word “pressure.”
But the "pressure" and "to satisfy" etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense are opposites.
See for yourself.
To fulfill (church-book, obsolete) means "enough, full, enough, to be enough for someone or something, to satisfy."
Pleasure, pleasure are related words.
Previously, it had the meaning of “do not depend on anything, have a self-satisfactory value” – “to satisfy oneself”.
The Old Slavonic "dol<0xC5><0xA3>ti" is related to the words "to rule" and "will".
To push, to suppress - completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squeezing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to oppress".
A similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "to overcome", as well as the inevitable aging of the latter, forced them into contamination.
So we have this same "d[a]d" that is used in the letter through "a", which, at best, is incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
That's right, enough.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper sense is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “pressure.”
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that this is the office.

Our car is noticeably slower than the Mercedes.
Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen - about the qualification of the Russian Grand Prix, after which he took fourth place.
“Kimi, did you have a chance to fight for Paul today?
“How well was the car?”
"It seems that Mercedes were much faster today," says Raikkonen F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our car turned out to be the best since the beginning of the weekend.”
“In the course of qualifying, you did not give way in speed to Sebastian Vettel, but in the end, the lag still turned out to be noticeable.
What's the reason?"
“My attempt was not bad, but then one of the Mercedes drivers came forward.
He was preparing to try and still managed to miss me, but I seem to have lost some time on this.

Russian bailiffs demand debt from dead old woman
In Kurgan, the bailiffs required a long-dead woman to pay a state fee of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the Ural meridian.
In mid-September, the relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan Division of Judicial Officers, which reported that an enforcement proceeding had been initiated against a 105-year-old woman.
Under the court’s ruling, the woman must pay 200 rubles to the local tax inspectorate.
After receiving the letter, the relatives of Slepneva approached the department for clarifications.
The bailiffs promised to deal with the situation.
Users of social networks, having learned about the incident, advised relatives to file counter-claims for non-payment of pension and social benefits to the elderly woman for "lived" after the death of the year.

Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the minister demanding his resignation.
With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria killed about 100 thousand terrorists, of which 85 thousand terrorists destroyed the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the Air Force, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: the air and space forces have applied and continue to apply all strikes precisely on the targets of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years - we are talking, for example, about ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this became a decisive contribution to the promotion of the government troops of Syria, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including “Islamic State” (IS, banned in Russia) and “Jebhat-an-Nusru” (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS there were about four thousand militants from Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries.
And it is only about the registered persons, not including those who were not identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise, this evil "would flow to us."

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions have been directed, it has committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” as the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction on their way.”
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of its illegal foreign presence, and priority will be given to Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Hostile Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with prohibited phosphorous munitions.
The U.S. has denied all the charges.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I protect the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are – in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I completely share every letter that the Foreign Ministry has said," the President said.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in the Consulate of Hungary in Beregovo.
At the same time, they loudly swore an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the Consul of Hungary, who appears in the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region has initiated a criminal case on the fact of issuance of passports of Hungary.
The incident is classified under the article "State treason".
Putin has secretly arrived in Siberia.
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council of States, and also held a series of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on flights of the Russian “board No. 1” on the website of Flightradar indicate that about 6 p.m. Tajik time on September 28, Il-96-300 flew out of Dushanbe airport and took a course to the north-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the transponder of the aircraft was switched off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the airliner could have flown to Khakasia.
According to the Baikal24 agency, the president met in Abakaan on the night of September 29 personally the head of the region Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin came to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round."
The second round of elections for the head of the region will be held in Khakassia next Sunday.
In it came Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on 21 September Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov should take part Andrei Filyagin ("Just Russia").
Khakassian media suggest that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new vice president of the republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the hostilities are coming to an end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Speaking at the United Nations, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing its reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by the terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All the conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have complicated people's lives and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen fully acknowledged its guilt in the diesel heist in January 2017.
Last December, Oliver Schmidt, one of the company’s managers, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group’s losses are estimated at at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 billion.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June of next year, the automaker is required to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said that the commitments have already been fulfilled for 83% of the cars, so the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is trying very hard to compensate for the losses and restore the trust of customers.
Thus, the management of the concern has recently changed again, and it has also been announced a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy back even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: such a right was granted to the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
“It’s like putting a yellow star on a Jew in fascist Germany, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that’s exactly why this bill was created,” the Metropolitan said on the air of the TV channel “Russia-24” (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of law,” the cleric believes.
“This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Deputy of the Holy Assumption Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the site of the monastery.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives by faith and spirit, Christians had to confess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has arisen, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the deputy of the Lavra stressed that you will probably “need your physical presence”.
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threatened with execution, and therefore we will protect our sanctuary."
Who does not care about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, we must be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on the occasion of those who mislead the believers.
The UOC has the canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to introduce dependence on the newsworthy patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” said the vice-chancellor of the laurel.
He recalled that since October 1990 the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other Tomos have faiths, or are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers have to decide what kind of temple they want to go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that the domes are shining on the temples that they want to destroy,” the priest said.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
There is a laurel tree at the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.
The club was evacuated after a bomb was reported.

After the inspection of the cinematographers, the information has not been confirmed,” the source told RIA Novosti police.
As specified by the interlocutor of the agency, there were no visitors to the institution, the building left several employees of the club.
On September 18, about 100 people were evacuated from the building of the Moscow City Duma on Passion Boulevard.
The reason for the evacuation was also an anonymous call to law enforcement agencies.

You cling to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family,” she wrote.
There were also those who advised Buzova to contact psychologists or at least read books on this topic.
“Could it be worth reading the psychology literature?
What do you need to do in order not to make a sacrifice?" - wrote @liasukgalina.
However, there were also those who supported the singer.
“Ola, don’t worry about it.
Your man will not say loud words all over the country and then just not perform them," Buzova said.
“You’re the queen and you need a king, and the one who turned you into paper is just not worthy of you.
Above the nose and go further," - wrote @kreszentia_f.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and abandon Buzova because the singer does not like him.
He decided to donate all his money to charity.
If we continue to play the right way, victory will come.
The head coach of the Moscow "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobyev - about the defeat of the "Automobilist" (0: 1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"A good game was interesting, even though she went to the goal," Vorobyev said, according to the official website of "Automobilist".
“We tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
We didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent bit us, we stood.
But the removals fed us a bit.
The guys played great, did the coaching.
I think if we continue to play the right way, the victories will come.
Not scored, with zero goals the game does not win, but the content of the game itself was correct.
We will be lucky if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, "Car driver" added compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“There was no foreign team at the time.
In the preseason, the teams solved other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
"Car driver" is a good good team.
On the tournament table, it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both on the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
A good defense, a good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work out.”

U.S. to boost opiate production in Afghanistan
Much has been said about the sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants launched a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patrushev said.
The war in Afghanistan did not start yesterday.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (banned in Russia), planted in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, the United States and its NATO allies launched Operation Invincible Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more phantom than it was then.
U.S. troops have been driven out of dozens of bases.
As they can, get rid of the fighters for the money - if only they did not touch them.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban movement (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they grow quickly there.
The goal of creating a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia is precisely what they failed to achieve in Iraq and Syria.
America, it seems, is doing well.
The fact is that in the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of the area sown by opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to the change of the country's name.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right to be called Macedonia as its northern neighbor, seeing in this name an attempt at the same-named Greek language.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
Greece has a right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not please absolutely everyone.”
For the renaming of the country are the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the president of the country George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is in disarray.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.
