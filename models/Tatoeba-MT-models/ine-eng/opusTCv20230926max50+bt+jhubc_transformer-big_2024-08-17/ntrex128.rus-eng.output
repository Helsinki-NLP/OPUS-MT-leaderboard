Members of the Welsh Assembly don't want to "look at the mappets"
Some members of the National Assembly are dissatisfied with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) for their names.
The resolution is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour member, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation "remnants Twp and Pwp".
For our readers, not from Wales: in Welsh twp means “stupid”, and pwp means “cuckoo”.
According to a member of the Assembly from the Welsh Party, his organization as a whole “remained dissatisfied” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to writing the word Muppet (map).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire English dialect.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting the renaming bill, made the following statement: “The final decision on the names of the Members of the Assembly will, of course, remain with them.”
The Wales Governance Act of 2017 empowers the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the "Parliament of Wales" option instead of the "Assembly" found widespread support among the local population.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the most public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it will be difficult for the Chairman, Elin Jones, to find a solution that suits everyone. It should be recalled that the draft law on amendments should be submitted in a few weeks.
The reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the structure of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, residents of Macedonia will vote on the renaming of the country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is designed to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against the accession of its northern neighbor to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he will not recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is only the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Harlem parishes: the bells of St. Martin were forever silenced
“The elders of the area I spoke to said that there used to be bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Now there is nothing else.”
The disappearance of the bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room of the whole area, where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, it is worrying that the funds received from the sale of assets will be enough for a short time, no matter what their leaders hope. “Sooner or later they will have nothing left.”
On the site of the church, he added, there will be an apartment house, whose residents are unlikely to support the parishes preserved in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams said, “and it will be a day when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was purchased by a black parish, located in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin’s Church passed into the hands of the black community, it was headed by St. John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, where they refused to take up employment or raise in the service of blacks.
In 1939, the fire caused considerable damage to the building, and in the course of restoration work, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who replaced him as head of St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carillon “the bells for the poor.”
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it another way: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical tool.”
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was a carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the first instrument of its kind in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play on a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriuezer, St. Martin’s Church has not yet found a replacement for him.
The last few months around the Church of St. Martin there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the secular leaders of the Church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The assembly of parishioners, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, in July appealed to the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to shift the cost of the work” to the congregation of parishioners, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors sent to the parishioners.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who was involved in lobster mining.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and suffered bodily injuries.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bic<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with the station KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he was diving with friends and about half an hour later heard the boy's cries for help. Together with friends they boarded a boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the teenager out.
According to Hammel, at first he thought that the boy was very happy to catch the lobster, but quickly "he realized that he was screaming "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Upon reaching the diver, Hammel noticed that “his skin was completely torn around the clavicle.”
“I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: ‘Here’s a shark!’” says Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Reddy Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, the rescuer, told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but had not been identified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had sustained injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sensbury plans to conquer the perfume and cosmetics market of the UK
Sensbury is going to set up cosmetics and perfumery departments in the Butts, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists consultants, modeled after luxury department stores.
Their perfume and cosmetics market in the UK is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the field of fashion and home goods sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this desired market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, there will be successes in the next few years in the field of cosmetics and perfume.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves previously allocated to TVs, microwave ovens, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to Sainsbury’s representatives, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names; including for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the boutique cosmetics line of products will be reorganized with the transition to products for vegans to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Sainsbury’s stores will feature perfumer Fragrance Shop kiosks: the first has already opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small shops near home have led to supermarkets being forced to attract shoppers in other ways.
Mike Cup, president of Sainsbury’s, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket chain is fighting for buyers in a competitive battle with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury’s supermarkets house Argos outlets, and some of them are now stocked with Habitats stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to increased food sales and revenue from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts of the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sainsbury's and Boots was organized, but later there were disagreements between the participants over the division of income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the sale of Sainsbury’s pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Lloyds Pharmacy’s Selesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more conducive environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. It will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones reacts “angryly” to Holly Willoughby’s exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
'Dragon's Log' star Peter Jones is 'angry' at Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with lifestyle brand Peter, but has instead opted for new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their joint brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old program leader This Morning announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den.
According to our sources, Jones was “angry” when a favorite of television viewers during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after concluding new contracts worth up to 1.5 million she would not have enough time to collect their marks.
Their brand was compared to the child actress Gwyneth Paltrow by Goop, and sales were expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old leader announced her departure on Instagram, and Jones himself left the UK on a private jet in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “The Truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision has led to the stupor of all participants in the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because before the launch of the brand there were only a few weeks left.
In the headquarters in Marlow remained a whole warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading "This morning", one of the most popular stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as the potential delay in the launch of the line.
In addition, we are talking about the breakup of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company’s board in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of the shares of Dan Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I'm a Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said last night: “We cannot comment on his business dealings.”
It’s a tough relationship, and then we love each other.”
He joked about the criticism that the media will come down on him because of the "unworthy president" comment and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the leading news.
“There’s nothing I haven’t given up on.”
He noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in re-engaging after Trump called their first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpiles.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Li Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at a United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still awaiting “appropriate response” from the United States.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation with North Korea is excellent,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have paid off: the missile tests have ended, the hostages have been released and the remaining US troops in the DPRK have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“It’s so easy to behave like the president, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street rushing into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction has been recorded, the victims are counted in hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that hit Lombok, foreign NGOs said that there was no need for their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lombok ' s population had lost their roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly made it clear that there was no need for international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing to send the team to Palau, but we do not yet know if a foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for Disaster Reduction, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine the appropriateness of involving international organizations.
Given Indonesia’s ongoing seismic instability, the country is still horribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters from tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shorelines.
Despite the tsunami warning, there was no siren in Palu to alert the population, which most likely led to so many casualties.
Transport communication between numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously docked in Lombok to assist earthquake victims, is headed to Palu, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s old infrastructure a mainstay of his election campaign and has spent countless resources on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko’s administration, running for a new term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president is also criticized for exacerbating the interfaith enmity between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows with arrows and other saboteurs.
Video: "Liverpool" player Daniel Starridge compares the score in the match against "Chelsea" with a goal in the far upper corner of the goal
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, which took place on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and found itself in the far upper corner of the net.
Goalkeeper Kepa Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was already late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said: “The whole point was to be in this position and get the ball, players like Shak always play as hard as possible to attack, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw Kante coming towards me, grabbed the ball and, thinking for a short time, broke through the gate.”
At the end of the first half of the match, the Chelsea team led with a score of 1-0, the goal in the 25th minute scored by the Belgian Eden Hazard.
The central striker "Chelsea", passing the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, broke through the middle of the field to half of "Liverpool".
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played a game on one touch.
Then he gave the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Hazard overturned the defense and struck from the left flank to bypass Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, hitting a far corner of the net.
"Liverpool" will meet with the team "Napoli" at the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA EuroLeague match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has increased to 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed it in Indonesia reached 832, the National Disaster Management Authority said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, there are still a lot of people. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the official reported.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was ravaged by the rubble of collapsed houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of inflicting fatal knife wounds on a woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, and a murder investigation is underway.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Muse complex on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the murder among the locals.
“The investigation is in its early stages, but I strongly urge anyone who has been in the John Street area in Birkenhead and has been able to observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured something on the video recorder. Please contact us with any information that might help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found in the compound.
Alleged acquaintances arrived at the scene today to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim's immediate relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in the Grayson Moose complex, tried to enter his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Residents of the house were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the police told the resident that the entire adjacent territory is considered the scene of the crime.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 a.m. two police buses arrived at the scene, and another one remained outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a personal message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (case 247 of September 30).
The monument to Cromwell in front of the parliament building sparked a fierce discussion about “rewriting history”
Cromwell’s “exile” would be a deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal a “mistake” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Probably, Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornikroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate among specialists.
But we can confidently say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure who represented one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of high appreciation and respect.”
Chinese Farmer Dies After Being Slaughtered by a Pig Killer
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer was the victim of a pig, local media reported.
The bloodied body of the victim (the media only mentions his last name, “Yuan”) with a ruptured artery was found near a hay market in the Lupanshui district of Guizhou province in southern China. This was reported by the Morning Post newspaper on Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005, Sinin County, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the cousin discovered Yuan's breathless body, and the door to the neighboring pig farm was opened.
There was a huge pig in the pig pen with blood on it.
A forensic medical examination found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had gnawed the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bleeding and bruised,” Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the deceased, told the newspaper.
Video from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate unit for the time of the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that Yuan's family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
Cases of pig attacks on humans occur uncommonly.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, severely traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal drove a Welsh farmer to a tractor and released him, only to scare off his grown-up wife.
In 2012, a case was registered when a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “trigger mechanism.”
“Pigs are games.
They are biting and very curious, but they have no intention of offending you.
You just need to give your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfall to a significant part of the southwest of the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving through an area with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring rains and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. on New York, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, located 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, on the territory of the southwestern United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, which has fallen into the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the South-West in the coming days.
Precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfall, mudflows and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical air humidity, the precipitation rate can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm of rainfall is expected.
The risk of sudden fast-developing floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Lions can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms can cause gusty winds in places and raise clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, places on the coast of southern California will collapse rainfall.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small mud flows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, there will be tropical rains in Arizona, which will spread to other areas by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will pass in the Four Corners area and will last until the evening of Wednesday.
In October, there will be sharp temperature shifts throughout the United States, due to low air temperatures in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to strong temperature drops in a small area.
Such sharp temperature shifts will be particularly noticeable in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and De Moines (Iowa) there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees in space from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast is likely to be unusually high on the east coast of the U.S. by mid-October.
U.S. Senate Hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Case Seen Over 20 Million Viewers
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazy Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political standoff around Kavanaugh’s nomination received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, the media received an urgent message: Republican Jeff Fleck put forward the condition that the charges against the lawyer within a week be investigated by the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was "100 percent sure" that Kavanaugh was drunk and attacked her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, saying he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers watched Friday’s debate.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen’s rating does not always include viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison: we are talking about the average audience watching the game of American football in the play-off or the ceremony of the awarding "Oscar".
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the case did not wane.
On Friday, a real drama was played with the participation of Jeff Fleck.
After the Arizona senator, who is considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Kavanaugh’s candidacy, CNN and CBS managed to capture on camera how on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake encountered a group of activists in the elevator.
The whole world has seen how he, having lowered his eyes, receives a buzz from angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one of them said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have power behind you, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position as women.
Fleck told activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at a committee meeting. The elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from ubiquitous cameras.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the position of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Fleck set one condition – to conduct an FBI investigation into these allegations against the candidate by next week, as was the case with the democratic minority.
Flake claims to have changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Fleyk's decision had an effect, as it was obvious that Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of "political games" around the situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published in the same column as May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Chess” plan within the framework of Brexit, saying that he considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous.”
Death of Wade Sims in shooting: Police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of killing a forward of the University of Louisiana
Police arrested a man suspected of murder in the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of the fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to the WAFB, a regional CBS channel, police found Simpson's DNA on glasses found at the scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson has a deposit of $350,000.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary conclusion: the death was caused by a cross-sectional combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the state police forensics laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and the local residents who have assisted in the operation and search activities that have led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at Louisiana State University, thanked law enforcement for their “good faith work in catching the criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the Louisiana State University team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 selections on average for the match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying Wade Sims' tragic death had caused "shock" and "real grief" to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” added the coach.
The volcano covered the ash of Mexico
The Popocatepetl volcano has engulfed the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital with ash.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention in Mexico recommended that the population not approach the volcano: in its crater, activity was recorded and 183 gas emissions were produced per day.
According to the Center, near the volcano, there was often a noise and there was a feeling of shaking.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users have posted photos of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash.
Following the 7.1 Mw earthquake that rocked central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded volcanic activity about 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl Volcano (or, for its part, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousandth rally was held in Barcelona, dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps. It was not without clashes between supporters of independence and the police; six participants of the riots were detained.
Police officers repressed protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw the guards of order with eggs and powder paint, lifting clouds of dark dust in the very center of Barcelona.
After the police set in motion a dagger to restrain the crowd, the riots resumed with new force.
For hours, independence supporters chanted, “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!” and their opponents responded with the slogan, “Long live Spain!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants of the action were taken to a hospital with minor injuries.
On October 1, last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government, but became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions remain in the region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia overwhelmingly voted to leave Spain, but the turnout was low due to opponents of the exit boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block a referendum in the country’s polling stations in fierce clashes.
On Friday, the separatists marched on the stated path of following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent its carrying out.
The demonstration took place anyway, but went on a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who attended a separatist rally in the company of his wife, hints that the hope of Catalonia acquiring sovereignty is becoming more and more precarious.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying with happiness, having been given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent December elections to the local government, the Catalan parties, advocating for secession from Spain, won an important victory, albeit with a small margin. However, this year their movement loses supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either on the run or in custody, waiting for their role in custody.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police-supporting rally on the phone, said the conflict was heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
“There is growing tension,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in the next European Parliament election as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: car crashed into house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was hit several times by a car; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The raid was made on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. local time in the Ballinaard Crescent area.
As a result of the taran, the gate and the building itself were damaged, according to the inspector of the criminal police Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that an onion shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Mengi's goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the team of Livingston
Thanks to the scored ball, Livingston won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mengie's exact strike equalized Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian club in the scoreboard, where they shared second place.
Gerard's club was without a win on the way out this season of the Premier League. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, the "Harts", from which the "Rangers" lag behind by eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will hold a Europa League match with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
The Livingstone club continues their losing streak in the division, having already played six games and not suffered a single loss since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missing moments for "Livingston" in the fight with hard-hitting guests
Holt’s coaching staff had to keep score from the start – the Rangers clearly couldn’t handle their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not work. Then defender Alan Litgou, swinging too wide, could not prevent Keig Halkett's ball from getting into the net.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer to Menge, who scored from a central position.
By that time, the Rangers had the upper hand in possession of the ball, but the defense of the receiving team was unbreakable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued on the same schedule, although Kelly still had to fend off a blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball away from Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a wide pass from the standard position.
Balls were constantly caught in Livingston’s penalty shootout, but all attacks were reflected, and two penalty claims — one for provoking substitute Glenn Middleton’s Hulkett and the other for playing by hand — were not met.
"The phenomenal" game "Livingston" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, reportage with the stadium “Toni Macaroni Arena”
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympus.
Their style of play and composition have hardly changed since their rise to the top of the rankings, and Holt’s great merit is that he has mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a superbly organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
At the same time, the Rangers could not enter the rhythm in any way.
Although they had a good game with Coach Gerard, this time they did not live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match they lacked possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defense of the receiving team only once. "Rangers", who dropped to the middle of the table, there is something to think about.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's cool reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and both seniors were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany with the aim of establishing relations between the two NATO member countries – a visit already associated with some conflicts.
The leaders of the countries failed to find an understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow the 25,000-strong crowd to enter the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters were located nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opponents of Erdogan’s regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Accident on the roads of Deptford: a collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of the city of Depfort, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car and the arriving paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car, the driver of which fled.
London police say they are currently working to identify the deceased and notify his immediate family members.
Meanwhile, roads have been closed at the scene and the bus route has been changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Riots in Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured
According to reports from the Long Lartin administration, six police officers were wounded in the riots committed in a strict male prison.
In the men's prison of the strict regime Long-Lartin (Wustershire) since Sunday, the riots continue, which took place at about 09:30 local time.
To suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado group was called up.
The police received minor injuries to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided with medical assistance on the spot.
According to a prison official, “specially trained staff were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their deterrent measures can be changed for a longer period of time.”
There are currently over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the manager of the prison was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison authorities were forced to attract special-purpose units to calm the inmates who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit arid areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is “lucky”: at the beginning of the next week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last breakthrough, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of rains.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Soweto.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass a direct line over the Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday evening.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status, being within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, sometimes reaching 15 cm on the Arizona plateau of Mogollon-Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, precipitations of up to 2.5–5 cm may occur, with precipitations of up to 10 cm.
For the areas that will be bypassed by the torrential rains, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although floods can pose a danger, heavy rains can ease a dry season that does not occur in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 percent of Arizona has at least a severe drought (the second most severe category),” the weather.com website reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, whose maximum speed is 137 km/h, is located 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has found itself in an area with cooler water on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that in certain areas of Mexico will pass abundant rains with the threat of floods.
“In the territory from Lower California to the northwest, Sonora can get up to 7–10 cm of rainfall, places up to 25 cm,” — reports the website weather.com.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of the state of Utah by the evening of Tuesday.
"The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is associated with heavy rainfall in Lower California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert areas of the southwestern United States," the National Weather Service said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous floods, mudflows in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Northon Attack: Four Suspects Arrested in Murder Attempt
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager suffered serious knife wounds. Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attack with serious injuries was found in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of the city of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as "stable".
That same evening, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon County and Somerset County police said.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime, who have any videos of the incident on their mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the malice” of the Democrats has fallen on Kavanaugh
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his colleagues in Willing, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all the hatred, all the malice” of the Democratic Party collapsed.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address categorically rejecting Christina Blazy Ford’s accusation that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the U.S. president said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class, and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s approval is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an untainted public record,” the president announced to a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly touched on the issue of Kavanaugh’s nomination, talking about the importance of Republicans’ turnout for congressional and House elections.
“The most important election in our lives is only five weeks away.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different way,” he said.
"I'm acting like I'm burned out and I'm fighting for our great candidates."
Trump says the Democrats have set themselves the task of “giving us resistance with all their might.”
Under the rules, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy is due to take place no later than Friday, an aide to a senior Republican official said.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many of whom were swept away by the giant waves that took over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the phenomenon were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday at sunset, waves of almost six meters high reached the coast, which dared everyone on their way and led to the instantaneous death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach holiday, instead of immediately fleeing to the shelter, and as a result lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Office for the Elimination of Disasters.
“Tsunami did not come one, there were cars, logs, whole houses, the element destroyed everything in its path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and crashed with all its might on the coast.
Some of the people who were present went to the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
At the aerial photo shoot of the Natural Disaster Management Department, you can see destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground tremors.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
A statement from the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake-induced emission of energy was about 200 times greater than in the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps, the tsunami turned out to be stronger than expected due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “large-scale,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Palu, in the town of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with Dungal were “completely destroyed, no information was received.”
“Over 300,000 people live in the Dungala area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone, said in a statement.
“A tragedy has occurred, but this is not yet the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was harshly criticized for not reporting the arrival of tsunamis in Palu in time. However, the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, an amateur video appeared in which a man on the top floor of a building screams about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the shore, bringing with it whole houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet confirmed the authorship of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major bypass of the power lines, which resulted in the loss of communication in Palu, making it very difficult for rescue services to operate.
Military transport planes have been sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian aid, but the evacuated population still lacks food and essentials, government sources say.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents, broken in the yard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, on the way to their eyes, a terrifying picture of complete destruction appeared.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to reach Palu.
Indonesian law allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the location where the element hit, a zone of national natural disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that rocked Paul, the friends and relatives of the missing are still hoping for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the people's faith in the best.
On Saturday, a small boy who fell into a sewerage hatch was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman out of the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother’s breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing pilots for Indonesia’s recent Asian Games.
Among the other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and emotionally it’s hard to survive,” he said.
Handon recalls how, after learning of the collapse of the Roe Roe hotel from other paragliders, over the next few hours he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Palo who were vacationing at the beach festival on WhatsApp.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray tick, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Audacious theft of $26,750 while servicing an ATM in the city of Newport on Livy
On Friday morning, the attackers stole $26,750 from a cashier at Brink's, who is filling one of the ATMs in the city of Newport on Livy, according to a press release from the Newport police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to refill it with new banknotes.
At this time, “a man ran to Brink’s employee from behind” and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses, several suspects fled the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information on these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed His Name to Her
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Yee.
He tweeted about it on Saturday: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym and even put it in the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will perform as a companion instead of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to "emotional experiences", the author of the broadcast reports.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’, ‘you’,” West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us.
At first there was Kanye, which means “only one”, and now I am only Him, that is, a reflection of all the good, the bad, the incomprehensible in us, everything at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye is not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy, or simply Diddy, this year asked to call himself Love (“Love”) or Braza Love (“Brotherly Love” or “Brotherly Love”).
West’s rapper Jay-Z has also changed the spelling of his name several times: with or without a hyphen, letters or lines.
Mexico’s president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against civilians on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people. This took place against the backdrop of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of educational prospects lead young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
China and its efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) should not be underestimated – the US should double its investment in its scientific developments, according to Lee Kaifu, an investor and entrepreneur in AI development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Previously, statements about the work on AI have been made by several U.S. ministries, although generally the U.S. does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we expect the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
An increase in funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that surpassed the highest player in the American Othello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects’ Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next contest would be held to help find people with nontraditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should be offered automatically to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation allocates funding to scientists similarly to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been taking no action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign called into question whether the turnout would meet the 50 percent minimum needed to hold the referendum.
The question put in the referendum was formulated as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of parliament said they would abide by the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it does not have binding legal force.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoritsa and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene, placing chairs in front of tents set by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, not crossing the thresholds of official cabinets,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring investments to Macedonia, which is so necessary in this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the pledge of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, but this is below the required turnout.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it turned out that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this number say they will vote in favour.
For a referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City bypasses Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling fought to defend Brighton, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored in the 65th minute, it seemed to be no problem for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three defenders of Brighton, before breaking out into the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, being in the penalty area, in one touch returned the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot punched the goalkeeper of "Bryton" Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero is having some leg problems,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball, being deep in the territory of "Bryton"
He gave an excellent cross-sectional transmission on the left flank to Leroy San.
Sane made several touchdowns before giving the transfer to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blue attacker kicked the ball into the gate just before he flew out of the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up points at the Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nesjonals were knocked out of the play-off, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of a single game of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, start problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nesjonals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7th or 8th place, but they are still hoping to secure a title in the first division.
“And while we’re playing just like that, at least we can keep our positions, knowing the tremendous importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of the audience and other team is probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?”
The Nesjonals have not yet announced a pitcher on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation tend to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, who is going to enter the 34th game, on Thursday threw the ball on the pitch for pitchers, and on Sunday, on his weekend, will be a pitcher.
The statistics of the right pitcher "Washington" are 18-7 with a rating of ERA 2.53 and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump is holding an election race in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the presidential nominee for the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s very, very important. I’m not running, although I’m really running, fighting everywhere for good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we are witnessing meanness and ugliness.
They don’t care who they offend, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want to get — power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he argues, have set themselves the goal of “opposing and obstructing.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, mean, sly, and false.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud outcry from the chamber.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to leak?
Mm... mm... what document?
No, no. The body language gave it away, I’ve never seen the body language so refuted the words.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization that holds different views.
She is not tolerant of those who speak her mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
I am, after all, the last of the Labour Party Members of Parliament who have not yet been told that we are not welcome for our opinion.
I have a similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the vote of no confidence criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the time out of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, the GC’s Friday evening meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that there is no difference of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more obvious, and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political outlook I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and take a position I would never agree with, whether it was a matter of national security or a single EU market.
Every time after my public speech — and it doesn’t matter what I say — social media is followed by a tirade of insults calling for the cancellation of elections condemning the centre’s policies, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who every day face a stream of attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never back down.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party is already becoming.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations urging me to sit quietly and speak out, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labours 32 years ago, as a schoolboy outraged by the Thatcher government’s contemptuous attitude, which caused my school class to literally disintegrate, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most — whether it’s the work of a local government official or a local government official.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been able to misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who voted in favour of this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is working so hard towards Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the repeal of the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I should.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East County
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible "Air" comes in first place
The two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but, no doubt, “Air” deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Premier League of Tennant.
Now they lead the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
In the end, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” said Peter Merci.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to Air, they’ve done better than us.”
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, implemented by Fraser Klimo, brought "Air" forward, but a yellow card issued for the game "Voriors" to the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed "Melrose" to go forward, and Jason Baggot caught the unreal.
Klimo increased the "Air" gap from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then in a break implemented a single attempt, making a score of 17-5 in favor of "Air".
But the Melroses started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s effort, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who had been stretched, and after a re-release, Air advanced further thanks to an attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by Klimo.
Acting Air Captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again the Melroses forced the rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's failed attempt, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the incoming Air Mole.
Klimo realized the advantage by not stopping almost from the second exit, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme striker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the field masters.
The star of Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiran is going to start work in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script for which he writes, and is starring alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan plans to take part in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: “Our sea is right.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources; alive and eager to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have become the boldest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision that will take place on October 1 as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the mental balance and, of course, they are waiting for a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice in large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is waging a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also looking forward to a decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision was made only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case “wasn’t complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, but on the contrary, it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, Morales’ bellicose rhetoric destroyed Chile’s last benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court’s decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the naval problem as a political trump card.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to once again make sure that we have to step through our past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resumption of stale nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri argues that the dream that long-standing U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest line of massive headwear that promises to appear in mass sales, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, there’s no need to look for something else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a lot of unusual headgear that is part of their SS19 collection and blinding visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats have gained popularity among Instagram subscribers, and designers have decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
Distinguished example of Valentino: a beige headgear, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all of these headgear is not designed to warm your head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also revealed to the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks were mouth-sewn, and they were more like a portrait of Hannibal the Lector than a creation of a cut-out.
One of the specimens resembled equipment for underwater swimming with a tube and protective glasses, and the other - melting ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, then you are in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to break into mass sales – right to you.
Hats of enormous size follow the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with fields two feet wide, which were already worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cult label that released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such wide popularity in social networks, gave birth and sent it to walk on the podium another huge accessory - a straw beach bag, almost as large as the swimsuit model herself, not a model.
The orange bag of burnt raffia with a white leather handle and a raffia pendant became a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will be on the mass sale next summer. Since the designer produced such a furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: outstanding exam results have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, seeking to provide the highest level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you are turning to his heart.”
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with and trust the citizens of other countries.
According to the results of this year’s latest exams, we see that languages occupy a leading position in league tables and have the highest score on the results of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an “A” in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students studying German, 69 percent of students studying French, and 63 percent of students studying Spanish also received an “A.”
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that, among the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacancies, 17 per cent had a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his further life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage — it is spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, will give children more chances to find a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a fairly large gap in terms of the languages that are taught – each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in light of the country’s future development until 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests may be, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with faculty members who are specialists in these languages.
Scotland’s independent schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
At the present time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages remain vital to the future development of the country, and this should be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “the skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edwards, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The long wait for fans to see LeBron James perform at the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still have to find out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” the player replies.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off a wave of election rallies tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his candidacy for the post of supreme judge has been postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time will Trump meet in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willing, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at hearings to be held this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh to the post of Supreme Judge. Trump’s proposal of this candidacy has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was supposed to take place in the Senate, will not be postponed until the deadline.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans in the November elections to increase the electoral rate.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign is aimed at having these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help “activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a tense election campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The action planned today at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing could draw supporters from “... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of Pittsburgh’s media,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is the state’s second visit in the past month, where he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who lags behind in the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrissey to start out ahead of his poll competitors, the president has to come is a bad sign for Morrissey himself,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. national team demonstrates readiness for the fight and nurtures hope by going to the pairings on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday’s two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
Transitional initiative is an exceptional invented sports concept, but it is in it that the players believe, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had the advantage of six points and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” Spit said as he left.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve on the horse.
Americans, according to Spit, feel the “wind in the sails,” and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least because of Spit and Justin Thomas’ form, who played together all day, and everyone can boast three points out of four.
The sleeper was unyielding from you to the green than he was setting a personal example.
The winning cheers grew louder as his round continued, pushing the deciding ball into the hole, closing the match as they and Thomas conceded two-for-two.
His stroke, which gave them victory in the game at the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one of those that speak of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to gather all the forces and focus only on our game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go through 18 holes and become the winners.
The only players to have scored more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have unquestionably made history in the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe has knocked out four out of four, and it seems they don’t know the mistakes.
The "Mollywood" were the only couple who didn't score a boggy Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the boggy Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series, and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the restless fans, reinforces the belief that even on Sunday they will not win, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the field "Le Golf National", there will be no more famous player, who has secured the potential victory of Movida, Europe.
It would be great if they were both in different places at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly parted ways with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggi and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug a Spanish and a Swedish pit, from which they could not get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
It’s so fascinating to watch the game play in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they exchange, and the deliberate silence, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has made a significant headway on the final day, but this four-day session has also shown that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6.
Europe will gain a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, wishing to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team's mistake in the morning games in four balls, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the gap in the score.
Jim Ferrick’s team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then teamed up brilliantly to win over the spirited Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic glitches, but now he has lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and four in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the fourth, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a 2/1 score, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, however, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk a refreshing day south-west of Paris.
Earned by three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, the two points became a benchmark for Americans.
They won a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team slip out of a four-point lag, going out alone, given that Ferika's team, as hosts, needed to play a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of second-place contention, Sunday’s counterattack looks as if it’s beyond their capabilities.
North Korea Says It Won't "Categorically" Unilaterally Disarm Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said at the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were fueling mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of good will” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles and developing nuclear technologies.
“However, we do not observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able to unilaterally take action on disarmament first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s already-sounding complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for incremental steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject a unilateral denuclearization-free approach.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start moving towards the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must be done first,’ and raises the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal and even objects to a ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding, “If South Korea, not the United States, were a party to this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be like this.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting of the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide bomber.”
Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year at the UN, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much more to be done, and the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set any deadlines for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s imposition of sanctions must continue actively and compulsorily until we see complete, definitive and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to cut off funding for Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said after the meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip has failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest on special courses.
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all undergraduates learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine consumption with the goal of waking up “overnight.”
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaser, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After its opening, he got excited by the idea of introducing such a course, having made a preliminary report on the impact of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘I’m really sorry that I only learned about it now that I’m almost finished with my studies.’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was discovered that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the study week.
The lesson lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of the course, an image of the room in the dormitory is offered, where students, pressing on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, receive information on how each of these actions and substances - coffee, light, which cause lack of sleep - affect sports results, and how much is enough to get.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages course participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe they have a right to know, just like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health,” added Professor Chassler.
According to him, a false sense of pride that a person can “smoke all night” is still quite common, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight excess weight, as insomnia translates the brain into starvation mode, forcing it to constantly experience a feeling of hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser develop a course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year of study at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to go through a similar curriculum before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students install an alarm clock that warns that they should go to bed and wake up, as well as remember the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts a person’s biorhythm and leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga brings victory over Gerard's team
The Rangers went through another sad away game as Dolly Meng's goal led the unbeaten team of Stephen Gerard to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The IBROX team was hoping to win their first away win after a 4-1 win at St. John's in February, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted a second defeat of 18 games on Gerard as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving Schultz an easy victory.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost the spirit, did not seem to be going to equalize the score.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, and conceded only to the Hibernian in the ratio of goals scored.
And Rangers may have additional problems after line judge Kalum Spence had to heal a head wound after an item was thrown out of the hospitality sector.
Gerard made eight substitutions in the team, which went through Air to the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livy 11 strategy, thanks to which he increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-crafted lineup narrow the opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have been leading in possession of the sword, but Livingston was squeezed far more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes, when the first transmission of Meng to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jacobs took a penalty shot at team captain Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, only managed to send the ball to the far pole.
The Rangers have taken control, but in the last third, there seems to have been more hope than faith in their game.
Morelos was confident that he would hit a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lowless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson disagreed with the Colombian’s statement.
The Rangers made just two shots in the first half, but former IBROX goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned about Lassan Kulibali's head, and Ovi Edzaria's weak punch.
Although Livy’s first goal scored in the 34th minute may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own efforts.
But again, Rangers couldn’t handle Jacobs’ game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerard began to act in the break when he switched Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a substitution almost immediately gave the result when the extreme midfielder gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into the game they had planned with the participation of Lithgow and Hulkett, constantly making long transfers.
Holt's team tried to widen the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgou gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
Rangers back-up Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he faced Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film Coronado's Bell, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans - seemingly unlike scientists - in the lead roles:
Man: "What else is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effect of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Look, I can hear you right now!”
"Gans" Geiger died in 1945, not surviving just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Anomalous Cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the therapeutic effect of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells get the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then the cells must be reintroduced.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who was given the vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the altered cells can “see” the HER2 protein, characteristic of many cancers, then the altered cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Institutes of Cancer Research, Wiefesda, Maryland, states: “The results obtained by us suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted in the capture of immune cells in patients and their "training" how to act on cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
Everything went wrong.
Kanye West was rocked in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke out in defense of US President Donald Trump, claiming he would re-take the post in 2020.
After performing his third song, “Ghost Town,” which he wore with the “Make America Great Again” cap, the singer spoke out against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on claims of sexual harassment by Christine Blacy Ford.
Television did not show how the crowd was outraged by West's statement, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh at this move.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes they ridiculed his hat.
“They joked about me behind the scenes.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “And they said my position wasn’t cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a Superman cloak so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to keep evolving?
Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, caught the attention of the audience, the members of the cast of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication: “The whole studio plunged into silence.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MANY.”
Lead talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply “who he is, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing, or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, you can, of course, bring the performer, who recently became a legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as “Prince”.
Attempted murder charge due to stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihakamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the state prosecutor's office.
'Game of Thrones' star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the sword-wielding John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor hotly criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that in order to be respected, you need to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his fellow Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he was “quite indifferent” to the problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge of toxic masculinity due to overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate, and what is acquired?
What do they learn on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel they should only show one particular side of masculinity?
I think it’s really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is how can we change that?
Because today with young people, something is really wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequels or sequels to The Game of Thrones, after the series ended the following summer, stating that he had “done with the battles and the horses.”
From November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s re-imagining of True West, which tells the story of the film’s producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life,” the actor says.
Rose played Igrist, the subject of the passion of the character of Keith John Snow in the fantasy series, which was awarded an Emmy Award.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are sick with these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections has been reduced to almost zero in this way, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican Party senators’ guilt, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. House Speaker Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed accusations that one of her employees posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the lawsuits were forged by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more vile lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings in the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Charges filed against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators conducted an interrogation of Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the messages, was linked to Waters’ office, and released information about Waters’ employees, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not appropriate for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why get angry?
There is no need to justify either.
And you shouldn't delve into the motives of the accusers either.
We need to stay calm and cool.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters’ seat in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
Waters said in a statement that her office had warned "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent actions.
“We will ensure that criminals are found and that they are held legally responsible for all of their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to everyone and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again – a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that somehow represents the UK; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise “Agent Johnny English”, production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film “Agent Johnny English: Reboot”.
Will the self-deprecating picture with the leitmotif “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the puny-eyed profanity Johnny English with a rubber face has gained its right to chaos for the second time – this name most vividly hints at the fact that it is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his whimsical claims to the glamorous smudge, received a little Clouseau, the features of Mr. Bean and a portion of this guy who made a single note to the tune of Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of Olimpi.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
In this last issue of JE there are one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the shovels were climbing on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift to the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such “serious” movie trials as “Agent 007” and “Mission Unexecutable” now confidently offer comedy as an element.
The sense that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson’s jokes in the Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a duty agent – Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, a frantic and hectic figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the character of quasi-Tereza May, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And here on the stage, the clumsy Johnny English himself, his own person, who now works as a school teacher in some lofty institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operative work: here are some good jokes, since English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of "rock".
The Englishman returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former unlucky friend Buff, played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man who obeys the submarine commander - the role of "fun hockey sticks", in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game due to the fact that in the secret service of Her Majesty terrible mistakes have occurred. They are faced with a beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxury Volta yacht; English breeds complete anarchy, trying to use the headset as a virtual reality.
All of these scenes, of course, are cute and silly fiction, but in all of this there is something quite childish.
Quite a moderate thing.
And, as in the case of other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies they are working on a plan to cut Britain’s working week to four days for a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week, but would be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers the savings they received as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, providing them with an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources said the idea "fits" into the party's economic agenda and will help the country's population to side with the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions has approved a transition to a four-day work week so workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to changing the balances in the economy in favor of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to flesh out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from the “impersonal directors” and “speculators” of utility firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current waterway shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make “deductions” based on alleged misdemeanors.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy Say '60 Minutes' Could the FBI's Kavanaugh Investigation Change Their Minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could prompt any Republican senator to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, asking if the FBI could find anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information came up, I asked, “Did you do this?”
His answer was decisive, definite and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained unshakable.
“I have firmly decided on Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by force of action comparable to that of dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure: Brett strongly denied all this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses were able to confirm these facts either.
This story is 36 years old.
I didn’t see anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce the level of poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival - an annual musical event in which an impressive star cast with an equally impressive mission - the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year as part of the Festival of Citizens of the World, tens of thousands of people flock to the large lawn of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, as well as to tell about the real purpose of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty in the year 20.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of a global project to combat poverty, carried out by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you’re not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteer activities or send an email to the world leader, make a phone call, or perform any other or other significant actions aimed at helping raise awareness of your goal of ending a relationship.
But how successful has the Festival of Citizens of the World in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free visit to the concert really convincing fellow citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Organizers of Global Citizen say that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival, held by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that thanks to these actions, world leaders have promised to allocate funds in the amount of more than $ 37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group voiced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to “helping children fully unlock their potential”, promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district. This was done after receiving more than 4t700 tvitti.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can do social injustice to the undernutrition of past history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Nutrition Force project, which will cover 5 million women and children through measures to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of Global Citizen said: “This will be a long and difficult road, on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monet – these are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, and its leaders will be Deborah-Lee Fernesse and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to block Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to the help of its navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy in the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the opening of sea lanes and, if necessary, a blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” the minister said.
Zinke appealed to participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister says, calling Russia a “single-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements came as the Trump administration set out to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the face of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third country interferes with our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibilities of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would carefully examine the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and ‘fix’ our broken government, and for that ‘up’ we need a woman,” says Warren The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren thus assessed President Donald Trump’s activities during the meeting: “He is leading this district in the wrong direction.”
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we start voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The poll found that the population is more supportive of former Gov. Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the election, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known names of Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims he will make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin spoke about Trak Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump’s voters
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same thing as other family members who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and have had injuries, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a sight for sore eyes” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They are coming back already other, hardened, wondering if there is as much respect for their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military as they have given their country.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman by intervening in a situation of violence and storing weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of Vassilla’s police department.
18 states, District of Columbia, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday from a court consultant on the support of a asylum seeker contesting the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the “Grace v. Sessions” lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband "and his sons who are part of a criminal group" subjected her to ill-treatment, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing a large number of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants escaping domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court counsel said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that the policy prohibiting immigrants from entering harms the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate Efforts to Save People in Palu: Death toll Doubles in Search of Survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It’s very difficult right now,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusum, comforting her sick baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency help brings in the wounded every minute.
“Clean water in a big deficit.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwye Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near an army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing strong pushbacks.
He cries, remembering how a strong earthquake destroyed a room in a hotel on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
“I think I was pushed into the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they’ve been saved and now they’re all right.”
US ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “propaganda advertising”
A week after one of China’s official newspapers published a four-page ad in a daily American newspaper about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, making accusations against China in an attempt to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections that will take place on November 6. This accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington’s intensifying campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, as a result of which they are leveling tariffs on imports from their countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war had the task of striking exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now doubles this hype by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by paying for and placing ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could get acquainted with after learning about China’s alarming economic policy, because the local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party,” he said.
He also added that one of China’s most famous newspapers had “stunnedly deviated” from the offer to publish his article, although he did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: with the Kavanaugh dispersal, Republicans are pushing back women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay on the sidelines and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite several claims of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this situation have escalated to extremes, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to those things later,” writes Grant Rieer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in his article published on Saturday.
Ryer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) attempts to conduct an FBI investigation made at the very last minute will be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget about what happened yesterday. They will not forget about it either tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November ahead!” across the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” non-partisan political scientist Stu Rotenberg said on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already escalated enough, and it’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of women voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if Republicans confirmed the motion, this step could trigger a backlash.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat on the bench of the defendants, but also about how Republicans are handling how they treat her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to trust anyway – Ford or Cavano, and a little more inclined to the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are accurate or likely to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they are accurate or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent believe Kavanaugh most likely or definitely lied while giving his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, being in a state of intoxication, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data stores” or PODs.
It can contain lists of contacts, affairs, as well as a calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools to work with data.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – everything can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make radical changes that will change all of their business models overnight.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In his Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in debates about net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a church servant awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglize and Loucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The monument to this event was solemnly unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the Canal Saint-Canten "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he threw himself on the line of fire and, with "the greatest courage", led the group forward, and then with one hand threw a field gun, knocking down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said that “he could hardly have done the same heroic thing, but it humiliates.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the virtue of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppa Pig
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six main program fights, the fights were broadcast all night live on the UK's 5th television channel.
At 6 a.m., when Geghard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, UK fans were stunned to see Peppa Pig on screen.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change of broadcasting to a children's cartoon "some sick joke".
“There was a government ruling that for 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Pepp's Pig."
Bellator President Scott Cocker said they plan to schedule the games in a way that will allow viewers from the UK to watch them in the future.
“As for the replay, I think we can sort this out,” says Cocker.
“But there is Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to solve this issue until Sunday in our time, and for them it will be already Monday.
But we will do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a lot of text messages were scattered, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of state importance.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we try to increase this number, but there was a breakthrough.
Yes, it didn’t work out well.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley experienced a sense of inferiority due to his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than anyone because of his sexuality, but that’s what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 program Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out on gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a baby.
The permanent host of the multi-year show Kirsty Young due to the disease took a vacation for several months.
Daley, who played the main guest on Laverne’s show, said he felt “more worthless than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: “Until today, these feelings of worthlessness and inconsistency were quite real, but they gave me strength and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “meaning something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took him by surprise.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
“If so much happens in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer who would have had the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that "all his worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t want to put up with him dying, and one of his last requests was to get tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he wasn’t invincible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming of all my life – diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song – Proud by Heather Small – which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 a.m.
Michelson, who is not in shape, spent this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to tighten his form to avoid an unpleasant blizzard.
Mikelson, who played at the biennale for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furrick on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time major winner splits his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what worries him.
Never having had the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not the perfect candidate for the hard-boiled Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccurate impacts.
And if the course itself isn’t scary enough, Michelson will meet British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a furious start, the match of Michelson can be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role he was assigned to today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself, too.
He is a walking Hall of Famer, and he has done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he’d play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that’s how it was, and that’s how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Mikelson will beat Nick Foldo’s record for the number of games in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferik said his presence brought a lot of benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to cheer people up, and he’s a great guy who’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week and it was interesting to watch.
His game is so much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant single-tier leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn in the wrong direction.
The Dutchman made his debut in a match in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only slightly ahead with the smallest difference, winning with a score of 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but just now,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, captured in the photo, after looking at the 2018 Class, having won the National 5 and the National 5.
So history will prove to me and to the whole team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you'll be in full swing.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as the glasses are not on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and that’s a chance to win a trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
“I spoke quietly, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well what we are up against – against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players performed on an uncomfortable golf course for them, Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in that.
We have another test tomorrow.
Individual performances will begin tomorrow, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re experiencing all of your strengths as a professional golfer.
This is exactly the idea that players need to be inspired to make their day tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind, and he too must make all his efforts.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players individually will perform better than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferrick himself has been through all this carousel in recent days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe held the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, put his players together before the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it faster, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we’ll try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this particular group of guys, and in that order, because I believe that this way they will cover up all possible flaws,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed again.
The newest frigate of the German fleet was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war warships, but this will not happen any less next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost growth, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the completely new frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies — such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – there should be the possibility of deploying the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The software flaws were particularly critical, as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to implement upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping the latest frigates anchored are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings of a reduction in Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the naval forces were actually “ending up a supply of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said the problem worsened over time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no replacement ships had been provided.
He visited that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could ever be taken into service by the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at one of the Scottish Highlands estates, aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is to be hoped that the obtained data will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and will help in further activities to preserve the species.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland, will explore common netopyri, soprano netopyri, as well as brown long-haired bats and Dobanton night owls inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to monitor the actions of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the main directions of work for habitat management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways of maintaining forest arrays in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of extinction due to construction and development works that affect their habitat and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose a danger, as well as adhesive tape for flies, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a complex echo-location technique to accurately identify obstacles on the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of the bat population very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, field inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threeave estate in Damfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threeave, it’s a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He recalled the importance of verifying the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance within private ownership, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could result in the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, grazing or destruction of their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer with the bat conservation fund, is calling on the public to help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many separate species live.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied accusations of rape against him, calling them “fake news” and claiming that people simply “want to sneak up” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published the charges against the footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram, in which the footballer has 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they told us today is all fake news,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner on camera.
“They just want to piss off using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
I’m a happy person and everything is great,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for charges they called “inadmissible information about privacy concerns,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player intends to seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy but one percent bad.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Maiorga also claims that she turned to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of being avenged” and was afraid of “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience the traumatic feelings inflicted as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he switched to Italian giants Juve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: UK ‘regrets automakers lost forever’
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark said the UK would “regret it forever” if after Brexit it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing.
He also commented that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernastone, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The plant in Bernastone produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” says Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini production plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a Brexit deal, supply chains will be put at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “on time” and parts for custom-made cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its plant in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s plan, voiced in the Chekers, on future relations with the EU was “exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow, I repeat, not only to succeed in the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers claim that we should be absolutely in a position to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to specify how long production will stop, but in the longer term warned that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Bernastone for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s union, says the concern among members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we won’t be able to get them back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
A responsible meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of supreme judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice on the part of the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general from office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has raised a lot of speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
On Monday, however, he reportedly went to the White House to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI’s complaints about Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the manager, asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings is not caused by TV reporters’ “community bias,” though she added, “I won’t deny they’re playing in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president is holding more meetings answering questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without giving exact figures, however: “We have those numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had over the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, it’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The president’s frivolous, and sometimes bizarre, behavior in front of this week’s gathering of journalists in New York may be the answer to why this is so.
The Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter about concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has appealed to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude for the country’s wealth and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to staff less than six months before the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of filing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and an expected decision should be made this autumn.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery for a head injury.
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury on Saturday following a 31–27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on stretchers and taking it for a medical examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had had an operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury,” and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, just entering second grade, it was the first season of the Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five goals, which totaled 18 goals per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra cash raised will be used to help the homeless.
This step will nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless - Theresa May will announce today.
This move will nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more affordable and raise citizens’ incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional funds raised in this way should stimulate the government’s efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surcharge on the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this step to yield up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to higher prices and complicates the task of buyers buying their first home to improve their housing conditions later.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for reducing the stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of squeezing property prices by buying land but not actually using it, and urged Ms. May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and the cessation of unwarranted eviction.
He also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year I said that I had dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
And this also means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not citizens of the UK, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for hard-working Brits.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own home has become too far away, and the threat for some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the resurgence of a north-eastern club that is currently in third place in the first league, separating the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross Sportsound told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child with my father, and it always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not been shaken by such reputable names in such big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In terms of its structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” says the coach.
“Bringing him in is not an easy task, but I will believe that I have done my job, only if I can bring the club back.”
Ross spent just three years as a manager, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the following season brought St Mirren out of the bottom positions in the championship winners.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I honestly believed that management was more suited to me than a game.
It sounds strange because I did everything well, made good money in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I’m still under stress at work, but I feel good as a manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, on Scottish radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the results of the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but decreased sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of business consulting firm CGA, who received the statistics, says: “Longer solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8%, and restaurant sales increased by 2.8%.
The June drop in restaurant revenue by 1.8% also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results compared to restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out into the street just to pass the glass.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales would be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved to be more than ever for operators working with food, and it is not yet a fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give much-needed respite.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those reopened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand turnover.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitoring across the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of pages of “fake insta”
This news has raised concerns about the content of sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” account that their parents know about.
However, one in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake accounts “insta” — i.e. Instagram, a site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic, “clean” account that their parents have access to, but they also have secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account came across a teenager there who urged others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is usually secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “Many teenagers are looking to create online spaces inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a worrying fact.
Eileen Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ for Scottish Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileen Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled athlete in athletics. Chairman Jen Beatty claims that this step is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of the athlete at the international level over the past decade.
“Eilead has a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland,” Bitty said.
Doyle says, “I am committed to becoming the voice of athletes and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC, having suffered a stroke and lost the ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'm going to get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and today I am doing exercises for dexterity!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Advertisement of a milk pump, in which nursing mothers were compared with cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
The milk pump company has sparked controversy online, publishing an advertisement there in which nursing mothers are compared to dairy cows.
With the release of “the world’s first noiseless breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new breast pump provides nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in full hay to a cow under a music track that says, “Yes, I’m feeding my own milk, but you won’t see my tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a wash, it’s my breast.”
And then the chorus: “We walk, we walk, we feed our babies with breast milk, we walk, we walk.”
This ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them for a few days after birth,” one user wrote.
Elvie's milk sucker dresses directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk pump to mothers who leave their children to themselves?”
Another user adds: “Advertising detached from reality.”
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just gorgeous.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but that’s how it feels.
“It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “A fun ad designed for moms who breastfeed (often they do it right in their workplaces or in the toilets), and who, indeed, feel a little bit “cow.”
“This ad is not to praise or disparage our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with these inconspicuous suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is precisely based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie milk pump is completely inconspicuous, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in the bra for feeding, and at the same time invisible, giving women the opportunity to move, keep babies and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, comments: “Elvie’s milkshake is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
Drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk pump gives.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk pump has been hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Yakubovska, using this product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved unhindered to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed among guarantors.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking the child under their guardianship.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who were asking to be taken into custody by unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
“About 80 percent of individuals who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these individuals,” Olbens said.
In an effort to speed up the process of child registration, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as was previously the case.
In order to declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those deemed to be ineligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and the information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that if you transport children to tent camps without giving them the time to emotionally prepare for it or say goodbye to friends, it can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the gathering.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been driven from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “conduct this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Mualem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province home to three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will be convened in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the commission’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and cautioning against interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is probably what many liberal viewers hope.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness of the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled — to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled — to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed cable ratings, garnering 3.5 million viewers in the evenings during major newscasts.
“This is a fire that people are drawn to because it’s out of our grasp,” says Neil Bear, director of ABC’s drama “The Nominated Survivor,” about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-time comedy writer and author of “Just Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” offers another theory.
She remembers one time driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he’s funny,” says Ms. Scowell.
In all this chaos, there is something valuable – it’s fun.
Of course, unlike all other content broadcast on television, the storylines of Washington’s events can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
An exception is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour in a row, how a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of a “deep background” for his book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s jacket for $15,000 from ostrich skin (clothes warmed with pride, as the Washington Post puts it), it’s like, “It’s a D-section.”
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of his job is to make us feel like the reality show is that he’s feeding you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast of Trump’s show and the daily twists and turns of the story.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flays this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north coast of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during a CNN recording.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, at least not exactly when Brett Kavanaugh is being shown before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is being decided.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss says.
“I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money is pouring into the cruelest midterm elections the White House is running.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district receives a cash flow from changing congressional districts, in which two officials compete for the same seat.
This suburban Pittsburgh area, whose geography has not been changed for so long, is supported by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district, which significantly intersects with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that as a result of election machinations, old areas were ascribed to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate about funding campaigns between the main party’s financial forces — the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small margin in the March special election to Congress in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. punishes El Salvador for supporting China, but then backs down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela. His property was also in Panama until the partners evicted the management team of the Trump organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” a spokesman for the department, Heather Nauert, said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only with respect to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed fines, including reduced financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and killings.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should have been held to summarize the results of a similar meeting that took place last year, which was perceived as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration into the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparation of the conference to progress, and had effectively stopped considering the question of punishing El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it in sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic representatives have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were told by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst, who is part of the administration, but also spoke on the terms of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be a message from Special Counsel Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is currently very substantial evidence in public reports.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating the facts of the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia and its attacks during the past election.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps eventually to jury members of his peers.
But there’s a lot of “ifs”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and topple Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do this, and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times's data is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, which will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house I lived in many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later walked me to light the Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic ahead of the clash with the Vienna-based football club Rapid.
The Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take a strong position in the Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in the season with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we left with nobody.
Maybe, in the end, we could manage, but in general, nobody was likely a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we performed better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year definitely seemed tough, given everything that has to do with my injuries and substitutions at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly chosen, and the guys really get pleasure from it; the training went on "hurrah".
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and succeed.”
Women are losing sleep because of fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they’re not trying to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
And that's exactly what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for what they’ll probably have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial advisor: he will help you develop a payment plan for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or insure yourself with your own property provided you have the money.
Get your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battles.
Establish a health care authority and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and make sure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of establishing financial authority.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you become incapacitated.
Do not forget about the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
In this case, can you provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so that you can be prepared in case.
Martin adds: “It’s important not only to have the finances, but also to have the choice of doctors.”
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write down and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a walk.
The victim, whose chest, stomach and arm were hit by bullets, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. in English summer time, as a “coincidence.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the outage, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when there was an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district extending along a 300 km (180 mi) coastline on the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important to the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction, several tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggal several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vassilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervening in a situation where domestic violence occurred, and for resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his friends tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility and will be released on bail for $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unambiguous innocence.”
Palin is threatened with three Class A petty crimes, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, punishable by up to one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that the criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she explained her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly acquired as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos of the incident on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor’s Office Wants to Impose a Rare Death Sentence on a Suspect in a New York City Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bike path on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both of these charges may be subject to a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out a 22-point indictment of Saipov, which included eight charges of racketeering murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and auto-destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "carefully planned and deliberate", Saipov carried out it, as described, in a "disgusting, cruel and criminal manner".
“Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lauren Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Erna Ferruchi, and Erna Diroyho.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York was applied was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after his attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to watch ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov’s side, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only aggravate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence had earlier appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at a conference, Tori Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "come out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tory party who oppose leaving the EU join a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan, voiced in the Chekers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “win the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage be leveled and held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat the Chekers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is completely untrue.”
Tori’s Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving reporters such a comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Chekers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is unpopular also with members of our party and our activists who are actually storming the streets and primarily electing us.
Please put the checkers aside and start listening to what they’re telling you.”
In a blunt address to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at their jobs if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they should be forced to “feel the heat.”
“It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you down.’”
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved the Tory anti-Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim that they can set up IT systems and technologies like Canada plus plus, to work at the borders, to trade freely without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“Brexit is not good,” he said.
Warren plans to "closely explore" the possibility of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “closely study the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dilla, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There are rumors that she has a chance to take over as Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held another meeting with voters in Holioka; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to ‘fix’ our broken government, and for that it takes a woman to be on top.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuck), the player of LSU was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that LSU basketball player Wade Sims, who was suspected of murdering (shooting), was arrested on Friday.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who managed to shoot the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head and died,” Murphy police chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade went after his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting at Wade Sims.
During his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The youngster, 1 m 82 cm tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes’ team tactics would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had already made a good start and was practically hanging on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton stuck in the tail of the whole group – a choice that became decisive.
The Mercedes went to a pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel fighting, broke out ahead, which led to the Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving the interior space free for the two-wheelers to get stuck in.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then drove most of the race, holding on to his native tires, in order to finish quickly, pushing Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pit stop in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace on the remaining eight laps, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day seemed difficult, as Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and showed true nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock,” Hamilton said.
Traitory sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Sen. Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday over her claim that she had not released a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were “ugly, ugly and false people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s been going on in the Senate over the last few days, is fine, it’s anger, it’s anger, it’s disgusting and it’s a lie,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn’t do that.”
You remember?
Diane Finstein, did you "send" the information?
Remember her answer... did you “send” the document information?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Okay, stop.
Did we “melt”? ... No, we did not “melt,” he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Finstein sent a letter detailing Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Finstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t merge her information,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the allegations of leaking seems to have displeased the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you: her body language failed her very well.
She may not have “flooded,” but her body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.
While continuing to defend his candidate for the post of supreme judge, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in every way possible.
We see meanness, ugliness, they don’t care who they insult, who they have to step through to get power and control,” Mediaite said.
British elite hockey league: "Dandy Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the game against Dandy.
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dandy Stars paid off for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch on Saturday with a 5-3 score in favor of the Dandy.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead thanks to strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney raised the level of the home team before Dwayne led the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard compared the score to "Dandy" before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For Adam Kief’s 2-1 win at Belfast on Friday night, it was the third loss of the Elite League season.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three previous games.
Duaier's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goalless pass with David Rutherford's support, after which Boviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markwardt helped Coney level the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored a second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar leveled the score again, scoring a goal with a numerical overhang of 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dandy the opportunity to take the lead for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team clinched the win by keeping rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid an earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he deliberately went to his death in order for the plane with hundreds of passengers to be able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many missing as a result of a strong earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that caused a tsunami.
Strong underground tremors continue to destroy the area, many residents of the city of Palu found themselves under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues escaping for the sake of saving his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the frightfully rampant dispatching tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufrey Airport, the city of Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the tower was collapsing, he jumped from it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s aviation spokesman, Johannes Siraith, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter was able to land in Palo.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the earthquake could reach thousands of people, as access to the cities of Donggala, Siga and Butong is limited, according to the disaster relief agency.
“The number of victims is likely to increase as a large number of people are still under rubble, and many have never been able to get out,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency assistance brings victims every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross personnel are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and spoke to the country’s armed forces, in particular, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person was missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operated the flight, which crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reports that as of Saturday afternoon, it has no information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue the other passengers and crew of the plane after it fell on the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was not able to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane has started to enter the runway too low.
“And that’s very good,” Janes adds.
Janes said that he and other passengers were able to pass to emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was around the belt.
He also said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming on board, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the berth nearby also helped in the rescue, using an inflatable boat on which they were taking people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the flight safety network shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes with PNG-registered companies over the past two decades, but none of these accidents had anything to do with Air Niugini.
An analyst on intelligence has been able to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has given long-time testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told department members how he used mobile phone records to paint a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones; according to the data, that evening, Tellis was spending time with Chambers, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when the circumstance was found out, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to phone records, they were only called for one week.
Rowlett also revealed that some time after her death, Chambers Tellis removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wipes her out of his life,” Hale says.
The defence should begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What is “conscious hip-hop”?
The trio of hip-hop artists are going to struggle with a negative attitude to this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the content of hip-hop has changed, moving away from the original political and social issues.
The band members want to get back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues couple over racist text message
A New York nanny sued a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “purpose of extortion.”
Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came into the family on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, NOT THAT, ONE MORE BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending a text message to her husband, she twice mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris.
Realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, was doing her job badly, and in general that they were expecting a Filipina, not an African-American.
Morris was paid for one day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Now, Morris is suing a family couple and seeking compensation for a $350 a day layoff for six months under terms of the original oral settlement, which, however, were not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, because, offending her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joe Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were rude without wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on, you!"
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child just two months ago and found herself in a “very difficult situation.”
“And you are ready to persecute a person who is in such a situation?
Not very nice on your part,” added a bank employee specializing in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, the new letter said.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it’s published.
It’s very funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children’s book about the bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would refer to the refusal to publish with optimism, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was “both joyful and bitter” because last year their author did not become.
As for Paddington’s own bear, she refers to him as a “very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained prominence.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter said.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think he treated Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear herself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing the plane, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors vainly tried to save her life.
“Over called regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medicines that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself firmly in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, coming to terms with the huge loss she had just had to endure.
“Nobody around knew what happened,” she says.
“My head popped up, I kept crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-consuming feeling of sympathy for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have survived the loss of loved ones, prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 years old when he began his depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says her son was an excellent cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, the room lights up.”
But before he died, he quit his job because he was going through a really bad time.”
It happened in 2014, and Tyler, who committed suicide, found his own brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs Davis says, “I don’t stop being afraid that there will be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards, “so people know there’s someone to turn to and tell them everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit there and be silent, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she lived for 15 years — he did not become soon after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset, or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he was especially ill: he didn’t even look at the children when they opened their presents.”
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it, this event has shocked our family.
It broke it to pieces.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume — we could bring in at least a little unity,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “break apart” amid a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn’t Mr. Cavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if — as expected — things go badly for Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and elect him as the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to get at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of voting equality and confirm his candidacy for the post of supreme judge.
The number of defectors from North Korea has decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Pak Boon Seug, citing data from the Ministry of the South, said that compared to 2,706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, last year this figure was reduced to 1,127 cases.
Mr. Pak said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people, were key factors.
Pyongyang does not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the reliably-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un’s historic June meeting in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we do not have even the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also not have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Bretta Cavano, the Supreme Court nominee, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi says of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blaise Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even shrieking and suffocating, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and well-planned assassination of an incumbent,” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a biased attitude toward the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by his claims, as well as by how he is targeting the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to hold Kavanaugh to account if his guilt was confirmed and if Democrats would get a majority in the House.
“I’ll say this: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, it’s for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and biased man take the post of supreme judge and at the same time shout: ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi says.
And women should own it.
It’s righteous anger, months and years of rage, she can’t go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 minutes later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think.”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a leadership position. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique by which she explained to her interlocutor: “You might think I’m crying because I’m upset.
I'm actually angry."
And then she just continued the conversation.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men was that one day I cried with furious anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, who I was always terribly afraid of, and dragged into a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know that you cry out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they've finally brought you."
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor intrigue and left the race, Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
The campaign was already coming to an end, it was lagging far behind in fundraising, and so it swore that it would not participate in the race if it did not raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a totally loser option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only $250.
“What am I to them, a prized commodity, or what?” she wondered.
When she made the speech, announcing that she would not be running an official campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, as well as anger over discrimination based on sex, that she had been sexually harassed.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
“She was crying all the time?”
How a trade war with America could be beneficial for Beijing
Experts believe that the first outbreaks of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle is still far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated by imposing tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, ranging from five percent to 10 percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the U.S. will be equivalent every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to start experiencing at least the slightest setback in the near future.
To force Washington to back down means to back down, but to publicly back down would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of the trade war provided by the US could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would lead to an economic stalemate in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Aziz.
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safer thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the terrorist-destroyed areas so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept aid under any conditions or aid from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-distance hit in the water on the 16th hole par-3, giving up his match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1st-4th player ever to go 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated 5:4 by the player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, conceded 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, won the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points per career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won Sunday over American golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2:1 score in a single game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this win — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, giving up only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, vainly trying to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furrick said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to hit Europe a little.
It didn't work.
We're taking off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news The concentration of microorganisms has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, abundant blooms are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide stretches approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinells to the southern districts of Li.
Spots can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but compared to last week, their numbers have dropped significantly.
The red tide is also seen in Paso County.
Last week there were reports of an average concentration in and near Pinellas County, of a low to high concentration in the Hillsboro County coastal zone, of a high concentration in Manati and Sarasota counties, and of a mean concentration in the County of Liaison, of a high concentration in the County of Liaison.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier there is still a possibility of irritation of the airways.
For Northwestern Florida, no such probability was reported last week.
