The Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP’s State of Missouri Travel Recommendation, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents to which they are currently associated.”
The NAACP said it has taken this step on the basis of current Missouri state laws that make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts in court, as well as due to the actions of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri State Police, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have the largest number of complaints yet."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated attacks directed at black skin students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown in jail without charge for the crime.
The travel recommendation also points to a recent statement by the Missouri State Supreme Court, which states that black-skinned drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should take the money with them for a possible bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel the state."
According to current figures from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, there were hundreds of hate behavior cases in Missouri in 2015, making it the 16th state among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier to sue the company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which according to the ACLU is supposed to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the U.S. Department of State for foreign countries, but recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family is not at peace after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex with each other and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched the meticulous criminal work of searching for the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a teenager in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had been fighting a fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers," he said falsely.
According to his testimony, the girl should have defended herself, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and she blamed him.
After the confession, Dixie spoke of his eagerness and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie told police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks from the vandals destroying her grave.
He's been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter isn't there anymore," Linda's mother told the Mirror about the disappearance of the ashtray.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic tools.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It began inconspicuously, about twelve years ago.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his friends took a bike ride through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a wheel, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just totally different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to work with the German designer of erotic aids Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she operates an Intimity boutique in Prague’s Benedict street, selling erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
They are also design objects.
Wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
It was Berlin-based Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than what everyone is used to here.
No hidden displays, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products on display rather than in the perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to consider how to understand the Prague trade, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy was liked by both of them.
"It's all about intimacy, and it's also, you might say, gentle," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant that spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, led by the bed, won.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nov<0xC3><0xA1> from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first he didn’t seem perfect because he wasn’t on the main street, but because of that he was sitting next to the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the street next to the main one, so no one knocks on customers," praises Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a trade that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they entered into such a trade at all.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to the sex shop.
Right at the door I was surprised by the sheer elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female waiter in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that the male foot does not come here.
Mostly men come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know the right size, and they prefer bigger," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
These are the prejudices, the lived clichés, that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
In the same way, men choose mostly black clothes, whereas women tend to lean more towards pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product well called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don’t know who is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
In my teenage years, I felt the need to marvel at the serious tone with which my interpretation is being given.
It's like he's not bragging.
And they don't really get it.
It is for a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe couple vibrator.
He completely destroyed the taboo that some men can endure, and the fact that in erotic aids he sees competition.
"Various variations are being made," he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a controller in hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain fallout is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose tools and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess that would have to be a bit different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We have tools for them, too, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical replica of a vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experiences when using.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It amazes me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot on erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," I'm told.
The day-to-day is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not very smart.
On the contrary, we are quite a friendly nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "she already has some experience with both sex life and some tools.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka make sure that each product is perfectly functional, so they can find something nice and high-quality that complements their partner’s life, or just for themselves.”
We also do not want to indulge in specials such as bondage and latex, because we do not have room for it, however, it is not suitable here on display.
That kind of thing could be repulsed by the ones we're trying to target.
Which are the people who always had the guts to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look on them.
A lot of the products on display on the shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The very first prize winner was the mentioned seahorse 'and it triggered a change throughout the industry.
It began to be released from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-friendly, other designs, different colors began to be produced...
It is pleasant that the design of some stands behind the Czech Republic, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how many people buy the design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She has done a really huge job by representing exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also manufactured in our country.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it is not a large product, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I am going a little against the flow, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation, who agrees with Martin that our society is increasingly open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
I think people are mostly disappointed.
Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> currently has a vibrator on offer, on which you can have a personal message prepared, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the next year, there should be more vibrating eggs and other novelties.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limits of what is right are.
Is there anything Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> wouldn't sell anymore?
It is very difficult to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we define ourselves more by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in which a lady asked for a masturbating aid for her boyfriend with a natural length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we unfortunately don't have anything like that.
The question is still whether any of us have made fun of each other," Martin measured me with a suspicious look.
And it happens from time to time...
A wound to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend fights a disease that steals people's memories.
'Yes, that is unfortunately true, 'said the singer himself.
I know about my illness and so far I have been able to manage it quite well due to the circumstances.
"I'm taking medications that have the accompanying symptoms of the disease to slow down," he added, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family worked together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife tries to be at home, as much as possible, after her father's house on the White Mountain, the daughters of the first marriage of Susan and Teresa, the elder son of Charles, called Karlas.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> fought cancer twice and passed his experience on to Slav<0xC3><0xAD>kov to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's got 60 chemos.
After that, he was able to return to work on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I've been told by an astrologer that I'll be here until I'm 90," Karel Blesku said.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
Even actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialov<0xC3><0xA1> is now fighting the same disease in the institute.
Do you have an Alzheimer’s patient in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will assess the <0xC3><0x9A>S.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial termination of pregnancy, so it must not be carried out even for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and is expected to have a new president by the end of August, which is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law repealing the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violated the unborn child’s right to life.
MPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was reviewed by a mixed parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal and the Senate did it again.
According to the new legislation, there should be no criminal artificial termination of pregnancy in three cases: if the woman's life is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
The Spanish newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s said similar exceptions had existed in Chile since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world to have an absolute ban on interruptions.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for termination of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything sacred at all?
Trump’s White House target is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could talk about it as well as anyone else – see the carefully staged 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was leaning towards when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of presidential proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he launched a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this he would be lynched by the crowd of owners of cruise ships and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the base, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta by saying, “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal in addition, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he himself said, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - they invite not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let it come to me, who falls, who is poor, who can hardly breathe freely, who is a poor worm in the midst of a crowded city."
And it is precisely in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of a vast political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death tried to put a plaque with poems on the base of the statue, knew quite well that she was going to play a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of the French and American republican governments by representing a classical theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: The Mother of Exiles.
Combining a poem with a woman’s imagination is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He's taking the torch of freedom out of the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh strangely stumbles upon an important matter.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned passenger, who often after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean arrives with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will definitely recognize.
Their torches are not meant to illuminate the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletics Director Neil Black said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be "a huge benefit to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something strange is happening in Scotland" and that British athletics could learn something from the Scots.
“We’re trying to understand that and adapt — we’re going to work on that,” Black said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they’ve done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they have done.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as the team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,” Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
The MS will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m races.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track. He won the British Team Races and the Annual Games this season.
Doyle remembers her first championship, in which she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only did a large number of her colleagues get into the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the final and medal.
“It’s extraordinary to be captain of the team that I’ve been chosen by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but the knowledge that I was chosen by the team members is gratifying,” she added.
“I’m very proud of all the players who have joined the team.
It proves where I've gone.
They are athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship, because it is held on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I’m going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Look for a Public Function If You Can’t Stand the Criticism of Voters
The father of our country knew of his criticisms.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the press to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
This criticism didn’t leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and stupid and dumb we will be led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his actions.
The governor’s employees dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and many “who cares” views appeared in comments on the internet.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, that's what matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not pushy.
As can be seen, he governs his state with self-confidence and strictly adheres to principles.
He has also been found to be adept at using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his constituents — the first naked-head photo after undergoing chemotherapy is the exception.
Blocking people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by its employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chase, defended the governor by saying that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderated posts.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post told several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who talk to their chosen leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I have politely noted that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called a “focused spam rate” would likely be called by others as a “defence.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism, or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington’s time, the low price of mail had almost the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piled up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept that.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holidays, however, they have more time to browse the web, and most of them do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi under the umbrella.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is according to the latest data from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the package than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of skirmishes passes through the winter, the consumption of data has increased by as much as fifty times in this summer season.
In second place in the ranking of consumed data was then placed Italy.
The Czechs call for the most minutes from Germany, where many of them go to work during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia annually visits 800,000 Czechs, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was set on July 7 this year.
"The transferred data would include tens of millions of photos," said Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia conducts in terms of data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, on which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"In addition, despite Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslarova explained.
While the data operator recorded high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, the growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes spent in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge advantage over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Roaming calls are used by corporate customers on business trips," added Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a comfortable atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish East Lothian area, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open over the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales on his way to the final at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course last year. This year he will serve as the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend the championship title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
'I feel good about it, 'said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when my wife Sharon and I really meant a lot to win.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, returns home.
The event will be his first appearance since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"I always like to play at home," Orr said of Helensburg.
“You want to be successful and you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really happy to play again and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws sweet potatoes - in the language of local "notes" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing laundry in muddy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof flushes the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night poses a danger: most of the men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village is inhabited by soldiers.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one will be allowed to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 seniors were forced to vote in the form of a public raising of hands before the occupying army.
The current anti-Dutch protest movement quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and desolate city, where you can get to after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a five-hour stomach-shutting drive.
There is no public transport in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, journalists, and practically no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to only wear leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and the country's child mortality and literacy rate is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai – a rocky province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports the extraction of wood worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, Freeport paid about $20 million to local military officials and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore hard-pressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in Papua during the 1970s were tantamount to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – according to another report, rape and electrocution is particularly popular – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million people, 83% report Christianity, but the demographics are changing with an influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old who was born in Paniai and moved to Jayapura for work.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - so they lost their job."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and human rights abuses in his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in the Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he will hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jakovi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a campfire in the town of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the darkness of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this exclamation and tone, which was uttered and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with their weapons, reported the victims and witnesses of the events.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral commission building and things were still going up the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance – in which a circle is run and a bird song is imitated – of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began to throw stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were given an order over the radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” according to TIME magazine in an official document, the content of which has never been published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one heeded his words.
"When I turned, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shots were fired," he added.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, one of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME in a sullen voice, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely “ensuring” the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," a Papuan police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many others were injured.
The report of the murders was leaked to the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave Jokowi a passionate speech in Jayapur, expressing his understanding for the families of the victims and promising to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem, so that it can never happen again," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security, Wiranto, announced that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve violent acts that had occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be uttered.
“Most of the violent acts have happened a long time ago.
Some of them happened in the 90s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
In a June 5 interview with TIME, which was held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he does not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, say that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai, had so far been settled.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claim with distrust.
“I’ve been asked a total of four times in the last three years, but so far I haven’t expected anything,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was killed by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The fight, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, took place between villagers and a construction company manager, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Dow, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the belongings and their answers were a warning shot.
However, locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting into the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retribution," 29-year-old Domingo Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has in recent years arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of “ensuring national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil is poured into the fire by poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is equally unattainable.
The locals grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to be able to start a business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Because of the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules that apply to foreign journalists.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", all despite the fact that they received such a rare permit to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. But this has never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebel-held easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk of non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanath Nasir was shaken by the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to mask the evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people were calling for a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan “we want freedom”.
More elections are planned for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbing army - are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the rest of the Papuans, consider their vote to be a “debt” that they must repay to Joku.
"They don't want money, they want justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panayian shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: burying the bodies of the victims on the ground opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head bowed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has captured a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has detained a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about 256 million dollars in the Pacific Ocean.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named as Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged by police to a port in the city of Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were coming from and to uncover the “Lithuanian Syndicate.”
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop a large number of drugs heading to Australia," said Col Blanch, its chief executive.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for their smugglers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also facing a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current strike is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in homes for seniors, the solution according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague Pavly M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1> could be the infusion of a physiological solution, which is pricked with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are currently only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," said M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she often says, no doctor looks after it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
"I think it should be gradually introduced there too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be delivered to old people in a day.
A lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache, and decreased performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Laying patients should not be covered with a duvet, a maximum of cotton sheets.
One-time diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to occasionally expose the patient and let the skin ventilate," the doctor said.
The Torch is burning in Dubai for the second time.
One of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was set on fire in Dubai on Friday, forcing firefighters to evacuate all 337-metre-high and 79-storey buildings.
In the last two years, it is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name of The Torch (Pochoden).
All residents of the building were evacuated and no injuries were reported. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We were asleep and the alarm went off. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil defence said the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative accommodation for the disabled residents.
The incident could once again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which started the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, showed that the most damage was caused to the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and lining system at London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on board the aircraft.
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the checkpoint of the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers said they were late in finding out they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to travel with an item that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with a few thousand hours flown were compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object over their guard, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to knowingly carrying a prohibited drug on board.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out unauthorized items through airport checks and how much they did so on a voluntary basis.
It’s no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorized items – whether consciously or unconsciously – travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can pour into the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that TSA has seized the most prohibited liquid.
For a time, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way it would with smuggled goods.
Transportation of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned directives to reduce emissions of the Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, making it more responsive than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not, however, mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October when Member States should start to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone reduction regulation.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or threatened economic growth.”
Pruitt, who had long held the position of Oklahoma Attorney General before taking on the role of EPA chief Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA contractor had overstepped its authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane emissions.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to cooperate with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
“The EPA’s previous administration often failed to meet deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans,” said Pruitt, who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits with the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
The EPA said in a statement that Pruitt could at some point use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
“Opting in EPA’s views – following our judicial over – is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C. joined New York.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt’s sudden change.
"It's worrying what kind of pressure needs to be developed to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which is trying to help the polluters and special interests."
He poisoned the man with acid, but he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
At one point you are at home with your family and you laugh, at the other you suddenly change your whole life from the basics.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopherose of Great Britain, whose face was smeared with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopheros' door.
Andrew said he would open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise was waiting for him.
The man he had never seen in his life immediately after opening without warning spilled acid with the words, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart like nothing on me and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to the doctors, he had no chance of survival.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
Christopher's loss of eyelids was a major complication.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his grief.
Today, Christopheros has 12 surgeries behind him, which are by no means the last.
Injuries suffered by acid attack victims may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims have scarred tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformation and disfigurement all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed that he was getting revenge on a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police thoroughly investigated the case and then searched the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict on Christopher's family's astonishment changed significantly.
"The three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of attacks by corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior said that it plans to lay down new guidelines for state representatives on the classification of cast iron.
They should be included among the dangerous weapons.
However, victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in different shops, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch was burning at night, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the eighty-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to some residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what we were told," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept.
The alarm went off and people shouted.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 flats.
At least two cars were destroyed by a fire on the ground when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to the civil defense, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the power went out in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone, because the inhabitants managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the tallest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper set the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the sample of Ippolita, aged 32, contained a wide range of illicit drugs, ranging from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year separation and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record number for the athletes caught at the time.
The third-tier player began taking steroids a year before he failed bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging an ex-lover!
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> barely entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one wheel.
He also gets attention wherever he goes.
The last time her ex-lover Michal Dlouhy, with whom she lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already wanted a family.
Lucii was only 19 years old at the time, and she definitely did not want to hang her career on a nail.
They then separated, but the friends remained to this day.
This was also demonstrated at the press conference of TV Prima, where they met for a long time.
Coincidentally, they both matched the blue color.
At first they didn't pay attention to each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she reached for her belly.
Then they hugged each other and willingly posed to the photographers.
However, their meeting was no accident, because they will play a love couple together in the new series Prime Captain Exner.
The Islamists were given life in Britain to prepare for the attack.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of an Islamist cell, known as the Three Musketeers, to life behind bars and planning a terrorist attack against police and the military, according to prosecutors.
Four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar crimes, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "infidel", and a model gun.
This happened at a time when MI5’s secret service agent was putting a wiretap in the car.
"Recent attacks have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they hadn't been stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three convictions, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants’ claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk they measured 38,3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in the Watchtower in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the warmest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened out at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
Perhaps in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, the Thursday temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice on B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk<0xC3><0xA1> Thursday’s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice on Brno’s current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records as well as the Guardian came from 2013.
It was ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica there was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk<0xC3><0xA1>, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record was not exceeded.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>HMU website, Thursday's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to rise only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
Current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
There is a shortage of tourists in China.
Beijing is losing billions because of its visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion annually to support language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and seeks to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not going to do that.
The state media there are talking about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
Last year, however, the number of visitors increased by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world's most populous country, Professor of Economics from Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free access to China, and the citizens of the other countries have to pay their visas in advance.
Chinese officials in the US are therefore in crowds comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours in the front line, you’ll have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a given country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and has less than one percent of its population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses it to realize its political goals, for example, in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China curtailed transportation to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All this has an impact on macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central bank, the Fed could leave China as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China, as part of the sale of the currency to incoming tourists, will receive about $35 billion a year.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of 217 billion dollars in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, strike a very painful blow to the country, which anxiously prevents the outflow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general reluctance towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.
There are also a number of cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroad of immigration, has twice as many.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revitalise economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, the deadly venomous reptiles were propagated.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy cubs from three rare, deadlyly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will only see all nine newly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"Meter lengths are also growing," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba described.
The cubs of the other two species, the carnivores and the red cobras, will gain strength in the garden’s kennel.
We still can't say when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them," nurse Miroslav Dohnal said, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian snake-killers were born, the descendants of a breeding pair from a population near Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the killers from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, the killers need to spend 6-8 weeks of wintering at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a feast of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched from four eggs a total of four cubs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
Aiming at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on bats in the zoo.
Up to 40 days in the garden, they still expect the hatchlings to hatch from the black mummy's sling, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone conversation, Trump is creating pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>o Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president has accused him of publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked a transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under the Obama administration - he would look "drugged" after a U.S. ban was imposed.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk spoke again at the prosecutor's office because of Smolensk.
"There is nothing to be afraid of," Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, the president of the Law and Justice Party, told Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, reading out to the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When he left the prosecutor's office, he was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24 crowd, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me."
According to him, he does not blame the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that justice should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
It was the second time he had been interviewed.
The ex-prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was about the mistakes made in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, there was a change of bodies in coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said on Catholic television in Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would deprive Tusk of the chance to win the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
At the time, he did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many considered his summons to be part of an obvious effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking it to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who performs the role of Attorney General.
The summons to the hearing came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski worked hard to prevent, among other things during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlov<0xC3><0xA1> protested alone at the EU summit against extending Tuskov’s mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n left Warsaw on its toes.
Burma, Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House of Commons from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections, which took place in 2013.
It follows from the decree that regulates the delivery of voting tickets abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update and is currently in the comment process.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said in a statement.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the report said.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
It is their list of decrees that is changing.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or in Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are now closed.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenya's Nairobi, Senegal's capital Dakar and Zambia's Lusaka.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the consulate-general in Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of China's S'-Chchuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad had the opportunity to elect MPs in the election rooms at representative offices or consulates four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine by lot the region for which the candidates are to vote abroad.
This was the first time in 2002 that a decision was made between the South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters arrived at the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Remember Racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the nearby residents of Monroe, Georgia, and crept toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before a car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of whites with guns blocked the road.
The group's leader - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - longed for a cigarette and looked at the car's windshield.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n---and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence interrupts the cry of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is only a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men crosses the "Roger's" neck, the crowd exudes excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for murder yet.
“It’s amazing that not a single person has been arrested in all these years – even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps re-organise the event.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event is a dramatic call to action. Every year the community of Monroe reminds that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be started."
On July 27, 1946, a court physician covered up one of the bodies of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were expected to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, supporters of civil rights claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, by a decision of the Supreme Court, the black-skinned citizens of the state of Georgia were granted the right to participate for the first time in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election period, according to the FBI, that black-skinned farmer Roger Malcolm had to stab the owner of Barnett Hester’s white-skinned land during a fight — allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester was said to have dated Malcolm's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent landowner of the time, made a $600 bail for Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Upon their return from prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned and organized the murders," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officials who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief statement on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote," he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all black-skinned locals: ‘This is how you’re going to get if you register and go to the polls.’”
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event is organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is pictorial, engaging and pretentious, showing deep-seated racism that many would like to see as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn’t easy and it’s even harder to turn a blind eye, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to deal with the unpleasant feelings that hide in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can be no relationship between us if you don’t listen to what I’ve been through.”
The main rehearsals for this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day, about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - entered the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as assistant director.
For many years, he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm, and Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show begins with a brawl - Malcolm quarrels with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n---e!"
Rascona can't do it.
There's a fight going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene said cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n-r' in that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black-skinned actors sneezes.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the hostility replaces the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make sure it's done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Shout, gunshots... and the resulting silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The population is almost the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York to Ithaca, many watching them from the nearby area.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for nearly eight hours and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until this point, the killings could have been viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel down at the victim's head, watch the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy said.
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the audience, and it's over.
The actors clean the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascon embraces his two fellow actors and weeps in their arms; eventually he is overwhelmed by emotions.
"That's all right," one of the women whispered.
"We know you've got that role.
But you had a reason for that.”
Later that day, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is excited to talk about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feeling from today’s performance.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the disgusting deeds... that people who look like you do because they look like you do," she said of the reconstruction.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic,” she added, “it’s just called police fighting.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the performance for the next year.
“Reconstructing these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we have had to go through – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use are read only by the SRA.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times long ago, where the instruction to use anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some components, all of them had some secret markings.
When something went wrong inside me years later, I offered that paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of charm is suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual aid in chronically removing toilet paper.
Playfully, he found a loose wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply stuck a cross-sectional grip, required about ten pictures.
Especially the above was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into the other.
The set was two-piece and a different procedure was simply not possible.
To give it in reverse required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My disdain for the manual ended with my SEAT Leon self-drive.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the flash light bulb.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work was to be finished.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. separate the cover.
2. Screw out the cracked bulb and screw out the new one.
3. Slide the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the car’s bore, I would see a spring, a screw, with which the cover could be easily pushed off, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
It's a sledgehammer.
The cover had no place, no room, not even for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was further strengthened by the entry of my wife into the garage, which was called by the rickety and words, which from my mouth hear quite exceptionally.
'What are you doing here? 'she asked incredulously.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she ventured with a phrase that might be her last in a long-lasting volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, placing the main emphasis on the author's torture procedure of the manual, where the blessing of the burning iron on the hand that wrote the manual, followed by its pacification, so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of instructions Kladiv had given to the wizard, including the upp<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>nice.
"How about disassembling that box?" the woman said, removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, this happened, and then step 1-3 was just as easy and fast as the right-hand side.
I didn't think anything would surprise me.
And that was until the day a colleague called me, who was just talking about the collapse state after checking two officials of the State Agency for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who is able to interpret even wild stories in an unsettled voice.
"Imagine I was fined for not having a hand-washing manual," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got rid of the whole problem, which was that above the washbasin on the toilet of patients does not have a pictorial instruction on how to wash your hands.
His argument to the commission official that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that not needing pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of washed palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of cromanion, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So, for example, it is necessary to communicate that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is a joyous finding that a person washed his hands exactly as ordered by the Hosudar of S<0xC3><0x9A>KL.
Finally, I have to point out that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan for the toilet work.
In the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there the problem will not arise, in the case of urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang out instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could provoke a certain disturbance in the prudish visitor of the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he erased the corresponding opening by a completely erroneous procedure.
Pearson to lay off another 3,000 employees and cut dividends in an effort to revive trade
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to release 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program aimed at reviving declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Bertelsmann’s Penguin Random House, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in suicide bombings
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the city's Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a heroic mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the blast occurred Tuesday after a patrol along with members of the Afghan army was attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device".
The statement further said that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of death and are at the US military hospital at the Bagrami air base.
The growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO forces in nearby Baghram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban has signed up to the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the center of the city killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops who should be helping military forces and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, which he has witnessed in recent weeks, have shaken the public's trust in the government, its regulations and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to delay the Obama administration’s law ordering states to cut emissions just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
The EPA announced its decision Wednesday night to comply with the “Ozone Standards 2015” in a statement, saying it is submitting an agency commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,” said Scott Pruitt, EPA Director.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s effort to delay ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on the measurements, set limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA’s conduct is illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government’s effort has begun countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r got shot and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this hitherto unknown singer in our country organized a monstrous event on Czech conditions, on which hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie B<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>, Simona Krainov<0xC3><0xA1> and many others, not many others.
The purpose was simple, to show himself to the public and to present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was attended by just named personalities.
But few people already know that the filming of the video clip, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it did not go without a lot of embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic nature of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a punch.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a morning, I didn't expect it, my nose was bleeding immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the square was an unfortunate coincidence and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe as to affect the continuation of the shooting.
The aforementioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with a punch in it.
An unguided version with blood, however, was not preferred.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting boxing match in light weight, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council - walked down to the hall where he welcomed Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a's victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, the two boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be “the perfect test.”
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
“I had to catch up for a game with Broner (67kg), but I’m not that big.
I am small at 63 kg.
I would like to return to the light weight category.
He's gonna have to get the sledgehammer back to lighten up... then we can fight.
The fans want it.
Why don't they do it."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Box would benefit from this game."
Klimas raised a request for a payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko should make her debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel in the match against Linze Jor.
"The match should go in the style of pay-per-view, fans demand," said Garcia, who later said he was open to broadcasting the match through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will get that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not waver in Garcia's praise when he said the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
The two boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game gets that much attention.
And I will gladly put it into the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great game."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car has now been found at the bottom of the Volha.
Two young Russians, Ilya <0xC5><0xBD>irnov and Kira <0xC4><0x8C>erkasov<0xC3><0xA1>, have been missing since December 2005.
There was a huge search for them, but without success.
And the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volha River in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>eboksary in Chuvash.
Thanks to the documents that remained in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The documents have survived under water for a decade, without which the police would have taken much longer to determine the identities of those found.
The couple was last seen when <0xC5><0xBD>irnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car has so far remained anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksary police, who took the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a freezing road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be published after its completion.
The latest results of tests to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been interviewed as older than 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started conducting new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases to the investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests conducted from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be older than 18 years, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the respondent was “possibly older than 18 years”.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests are only applied if the age of the person in question is disputed.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are on the same track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases it was found that “the person in question is 18 years of age or older”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
There were also criticisms of the medical method of determining age, which includes wisdom teeth X-rays and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person underwent puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of age-based measurements are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age accurately, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise,” he told Metro.
Forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision saying, "Generally speaking, the risk of misjudgment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico over the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay for building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that the funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This comes from transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
Immediately in the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was undiplomatically punishing himself for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and urged the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
I think the funding is going to work out and eventually it will work out well.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to see you guys anymore, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall, he said, is the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometer-long wall, which is why relations between the two countries have been strained.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be funded by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
This conclusion was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from international facilities in Pacific island states.
At first, Trump thought the deal was stupid, but later he agreed to it.
“You can definitely say this is not the deal you made, but you’re going to have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump hailed Australia’s refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation became clearer.
“I hate accepting these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They're not going to be great people who go to work for local dairy farmers," he said.
In the interview, he also said that a refugee could become a Boston assassin in five years.
Trump led phone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, often several in a day.
The conversation with Turnbull was the least pleasant of the day.
Before he finished, he said that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In front of the crowd, they executed Rana's killer.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose a small Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the thousand-headed crowd that had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media about his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
The other members of the family were also present, along with the crowd shouting the slogan "May justice live."
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was taken.
The police threw him on his stomach.
One of the men turned his gun on him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every single shot that was fired.
Mr. al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I was standing on the Liberation Square in Sana'a, waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful insanity, the murderer would get caught and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court under the control of the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 lashes after his arrest, but his act sparked such outrage that the judge decided to impose the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after her disappearance on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the Wrath.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, that day we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the murderous parents who suspected their son of a horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
The wound went to play outside with the other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but the wound was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Yemenis were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was detained, demanding immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read to the crowd the record of the investigation to reassure them.
The defendant did not appear to have any regrets for his actions.
Just before the execution, the police read him the sentence, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the Internet that were taken by the crowd.
Governor of West Virginia Announces Change of Political Party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a Trump rally that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the governor said.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce... today, as a citizen of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor."
The crowd of spectators burst into joy.
"Tomorrow, I'm going to join the Republicans," Justice said.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump has already promised the people at the West Virginia assembly an important announcement.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The passing of the Governor of Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way, rather than causing the lifting of our country."
“For a Democratic Party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislature in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last straw for a party that is so far outnumbered without a leader who is in vain to find a positive and unifying message,” said Ronna McDanieli, RNC president.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia’s “sincere” apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for sincerely apologizing for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
The head of Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sports was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost the gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to uphold a ban that came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think today we witnessed very honest responses and presentations," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All the members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think we’ve done a lot today and we’ve moved on to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis staff to maintain the sentence that was imposed on Russia,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones," he concluded.
The World Championships in Athletics, which kicks off Friday in London, will be contested under a neutral flag by 19 Russian athletes who have met strict IAAF rules.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
The drug tests are still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board’s presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was won by the company Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savova.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is suing Sava for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the CzechTrade signed a public contract in April for a four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta by entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savova.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him on the run.
Sapov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was reported by the server Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade had to decide on 60 percent of the offered price and on the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
And it was Savo’s company that significantly helped that second criterion.
According to the information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
It was in the result that it was moved in front of another candidate, the publisher Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of 404,900 crowns per month, the VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
In contrast to the Young Front, however, it received a sub-average rating from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
Tendru was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz under the publishing house Economia.
VLM filed several objections against the tender’s outcome, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their rejection, it was decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
It is considered that CzechTrade has acted contrary to the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public procurement supplier on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," it is written in the application for initiation of the procedure submitted to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
According to Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>my, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the score of the selection committee appears to be an incredible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as improbable and suspicious," he told Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Contractor Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot express ourselves on its course," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, the agency's media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economia hit a competition with an article in Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was stated in that article.
In the tender could help her that it was she who provided the portal BusinessInfo editorial service in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Cuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova accuses the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, by which he caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the YES movement, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is behind his criminalization, which is influenced by Mafra.
Last year, the London court rejected Savovo's appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any clarification from the UK regarding the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to date," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the Prague city prosecutor's office, told Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savav represented Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company controlled by the Czechoslovak brewery Samson, and the Cyprus company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund that purchases endangered assets.
He would also be in control of a defunct company, Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savav was also associated with the expropriation of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker was riding on the sidewalks and the park, he ended up in the curbs.
The motorcyclist caught the eye with a reckless drive through the streets, sidewalks and park paths in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to run away in the direction of the Settlement.
"Police officers with increased caution chased the city when on one of the side roads behind Marianske Lazne failed to drive and entered the field with a motorcycle, where it crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Subsequently, the police found that the motorcyclist did not own a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, its production number was scrapped and the production label itself was removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"The breath test carried out on the spot excluded the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," added the police spokesman.
How football’s financial rules will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs do not affect Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint-Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Following are some financial terms of Neymar’s transfer to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star-studded football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts of money to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he took the UEFA director's seat in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements are ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules diverted its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and spending a hefty sum per player and building a global brand – was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be disbursed at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44,4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG has been fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA pays attention to teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Although the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
UEFA joined the move in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, Neymar's share of PSG's revenue could be paid by the 2022 FIFA World Cup organizing commission in Qatar.
However, PSG and representatives of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have denied the fate that Neymat should become the ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Tuesday, UEFA said it had not initiated any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as he was not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The last published financial statements show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, have sought to tarnish Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG is violating FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's ownership of the club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares the same La Liga stance on funding the club.
"It's a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years," Wenger said.
“Once he becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan defender Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> goes to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan defender moved the game against the Red Star, inventing several goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The flight team, pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening doubles match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else with the match on the Belgrade side?
After the goal was scored, four shots were needed, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, we wanted to raise our self-confidence, so we had to bounce back to the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why did Sparta not get into the game for so long?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The combination of rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we shot maybe once in half an hour.
Of course, that’s very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you need to push opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, this is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We’ve only played three matches and the lineup is still changing.
It’s about the coach finding the ideal eleven to sit on.
Is it encouraging to you that you have already played parts of two matches in a row?
They're still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they went away in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
It was a wonderful visit again, as well as with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember that kind of visit when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a cup-free season be at least an advantage for the league?
We’re fighting with ourselves, we’re playing with ourselves, so that’s not an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, an entrepreneur has to sit for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tom<0xC3><0xA1>n, who is expected to spend ten years in prison for cutting taxes to a considerable extent.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice had violated his fundamental rights, and the factual findings of the courts in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, found the complaint to be unfounded, according to the court’s database.
The Court of Appeal is not another court of appeal.
“It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors alleged by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,” the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where he was also in the decision-making process of the <0xC3><0x9A>S, according to the resolution.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has only a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The <0xC5><0xA0>koda 645 million crowns was created only for the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage according to the expert exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Tom<0xC3><0xA1>n for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT deductions and excise taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in the hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded are related to the businessman Radom<0xC3><0xAD>r Vyb<0xC3><0xAD>ralov, who has been assessed by the justice for VAT machinations in fuel trades for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer to Not Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both characters from the famous 80s; both for the dirty 90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for the more modern era, specifically the year 2001, than the stars like Elizabeth Banks and Paul Rudd to Poe.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
But from the perspective of the franchise, it looks like someone's breathing out.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main point of the joke - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not thus pull themselves out of previous events.
The sequel to “Ten Years Later,” in which adults play adults doesn’t push as much on an emotional level and satire is sporadic in places, including a parody of 1990s thrillers like “Hand on a Cradle.”
At one point, the character finds himself on a pile of junk Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "lots of other things from 1991".
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
Good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still has not moved on through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (a very well-stocked Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best parts of the franchise are many side stories.
It’s especially fun to watch the ever-young Rudd with long hair, aka Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once-respectable Andy character is now an old pepper.
The Frenchman could start moments of random insanity, such as the return of the "Seven Up" series, until he reaches what I assume will be the logical conclusion: "We Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the final scene the whole group goes on the premiere of "Summer to No Survivor."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon meanwhile appeals to another type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series "Such Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Mercy" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene meet.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak directed by Rhys Thomas is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – tough Gregor and idealistic Iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulica, who have won in English Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, that's not much more.
Some jokes will make you laugh (like police officers watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the insidious propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan masked killer - and that's what it looks like.
The six long episodes are too far-fetched and comedy moments are not enough.
With a shorter footprint, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat people eat hamburgers stacked up in a large pile.
A clear message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into a food and an orgy.
Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do this with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not wait for the cancellation of the IAAF ban.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) confirmed at a congress in London the extension of an international ban on Russian competitors’ launches due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The vote at the World Championship, which begins on Friday, is expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 voting against.
The main reason for the refusal is the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, said Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF special investigation group before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned, and trainers with a rabid reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully functional.
RUSADA, however, can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming MS, who have previously shown that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start the championship in national colours and if they win, they will not be able to play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following subdued economic growth and a weakening of inflation that has fuelled speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to remain “in the background” in the context of maintaining the interest rate – despite the squandering of family budgets.
The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain an interest rate of 0.25 percent. The results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported subdued economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the decline in family budgets will continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rents from mobility should grow more in financial markets than expected.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to boost the economy and was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, from next February, the Timely Financing Plan should start paying, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England said that compared to the <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion planned, it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with the pressure on real household incomes and the burden of consumption.”
On the issue of interest rates, the bank said it would need to “pull monetary policy lines” to calm inflation, “to a greater extent” than markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase will be "slow" and "limited".
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The forecast growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hope for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest report on inflation is a small consolation for households affected by rising inflation and a miserable rise in wages. The bank said the situation will worsen even before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” income cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise “significantly” by the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow thanks to strong interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were reduced to 0.025% in August last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that a full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the Bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was putting ever-increasing pressure on the household. Three political actors demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6% from June's 2.9%, despite the bank saying it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said the overshoot relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-mortgage – there are no-fee options on offer, as well as low interest rates they get on the upswing.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
From September, patients will have access to ‘transformational’ treatment for HIV prevention based on the decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial.
NSH agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court upheld last year’s Supreme Court ruling, saying the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexual people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in the testing.
The program comes to taxpayers at <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of efforts to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of the National AIDS Trust (NAT), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.'
Ian Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of testing across the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
“We now have a PrEP trial drug available, and we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays on the part of the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
"It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV, and jointly end the spread of HIV in society."
High-end living: mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - and is a striking example of modern design that takes advantage of the maximum available space.
"I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it was the same height as the ceiling.
I immediately fell in love with him and I nodded at him the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Duck & Shed, a design and design studio based in Notting Hill, and used a nearly four-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps were placed above each other - so the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room of an old copper window frame in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro chandelier Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror rails in the kitchen look like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights so that it can be removed very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage spaces, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is living space -- or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent basically calculates when entering an apartment his price based on the living area."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the electricity distribution in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart will not win.”
As it turned out, high-quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political divide between the red and blue states is widening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid for it and declared a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, U.S. citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
This is because California has banned spending state money on its citizens’ trips to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT, and any expression of disapproval of LGBT lifestyles is considered discrimination.
Tennessee, however, passed a conscientious objector law under which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that have received children from mothers after birth for adoption do not have an obligation to provide these children for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these laws, California has banned the funding of its citizens’ travel to eight states from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposiums, for example, in Texas paid for by their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants to travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the travel of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has been patient and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California’s high tax policy, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's using them as retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same shall apply to any State of the Union which imposes a similar travel ban on another State for any reason whatsoever.
At the same time, he urged the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
Here are the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they will not be allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can’t he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell even pork when the butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave him in the room and not order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policies in jurisdictions that are not federal, according to their own, i.e., according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought to be tolerant of their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of living and letting live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists are striving not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever again express a moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have done so because of political issues, except for the case of one.
Even in the days of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only such case was in the 1950s, the political cause being slavery and the war in the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening, and the United States is mentally interlocking.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin’s critics received a heavy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of the presidential election next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to take part in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin’s chief of staff, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling for people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not take part in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, considers the ruling to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on two members of the Naval election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in every way possible in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing the Kirovles forest plant.
In May, the ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so authoritative, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are dragging on one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has overtaken the common property and commercial property dispute to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being litigated in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, her brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
It was here that the Westco Jeans family founded the company, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is, in Paul's words, the "significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns $316 million of the property while Paul manages the property for $176 million.
For Paul, the division of assets and funds has become a problem.
“Colin’s motion was in my eyes very much in his favor,” Paul wrote in a court of law statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which, in his opinion, Colin cut off Paul.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous subcommittee statement, Colin said he believes in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of subpoenas, e-mails and company reports, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and advocates for both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a grocery store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy.”
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of assets to the sons would be successful.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies. Colin said that Mark was compensated by $10 million on his departure and Luke by $26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back since then, despite being a former AFL board member, as stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only responded via a text message in which he stated that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court,” he wrote.
In a statement to the court in mid-2016, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, all hope was lost.
"Our disputes will be resolved in due course," Colin wrote.
Wind in the Czech Republic.
The teachers shower the children.
The drivers of the MHD are packing water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovec kindergarten in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now attending, they only go out in the morning.
The school has been reconstructed and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the children in the mist.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and draped curtains are removed.
The air is trying to cool with an air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not even have open traffic," said the director of the kindergarten Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where according to her the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows close and we have blinds on the southern sides, which protect us.
'But it won't help much, 'she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hr<0xC3><0xA1>zi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees growing on the ground, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nursery there, there's a table under it, and we're doing different things there," said kindergarten director Barbora Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The teachers try to go to the forest with the children, where there is a bigger cooler.
Children wet hats and have different games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children," said Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The director of the kindergarten in Novoborsk<0xC3><0xA1> Street in Prague’s Prosek Jitka Vilimovsk<0xC3><0xA1> also said that the children’s teachers are trying to keep them in the shade and dripping water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child should have a head covering.
The teachers also remind the children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice and have a drink with water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack always fresh fruit and vegetables, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today one of the mothers brought melons for children," Makovickov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Drivers are given water or summer equinoxes.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
Both tram and bus drivers’ cabins are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokesman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged so far.
A minor damage occurred in the loop in Hostiva<0xC5><0x99>.
At the current high temperatures, we take great care to ensure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternate points and lanes," <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In the carriages and in some alternate places, employees have the so-called sodobars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also provided with soluble protective ionic drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily commutes," the spokeswoman added.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic liquidated 108, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in the fight against fire.
"Fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with the harvesting work, are being considered," said Fire Department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova.
Even the evening weather did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and torrential rains.
In connection with the storms, the firefighters went to 236 interventions.
In particular, it was about the removal of deciduous trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1> continues.
Firefighters also helped in Stvol<0xC3><0xAD>nky in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipska, where 60 people were evacuated from the children’s camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances drove to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the prison.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a feeling of fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the contaminated room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit president's media diet
Many have tried before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it will be the first.
The Politico portal said the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump — including reports in television news — in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is part of a report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with staff on the first day of his new term, he outlined a key problem that Trump’s White House is trying to fix: misinformation that gets into the president’s hands.
Kelly told the staff that he must personally approve all information — whether on paper or verbally — because the president can make better decisions based on the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have brushed their teeth at Trump’s scrutiny and his presentation in the media.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades — and now, as he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by the honest reports, it was convenient for him to show that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media that was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on hold — at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers — is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that praises him.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would be more infuriating if someone didn’t control them.
The tweets that Trump has never sent will most likely never be heard of.
If his employees have managed to keep him on his toes at least several times, then their efforts have not gone to waste.
However, no one has been able to prevent Trump from raising controversial issues on a regular basis.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by pushing Trump’s materials — which may, but may not be reliable — that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the propensity of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
Here is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say the president is often very angry at negative news from the media, especially news reports about information leaks, and is trying to find their origins.
The situation came at the end of February, when someone shoved a copy of an article from GotNews.com — the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson — into the President’s office, accusing Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a “source of many leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson has been forever banned from Twitter for harassment; or that he has not substantiated his claim with any evidence; or that he has previously published false accusations and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter were “trying to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness won’t go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission will certainly make it more difficult.
Tourists negotiate a moat and return to the ‘Millionaire Quarter’
Several of the most mobile home owners in the English county of West Midland are once again engaged in negotiations with determined tourists, who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to re-acquire the field behind their estates.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a burgeoning street in the city of Solihull, dubbed the “millionaire neighborhood.”
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were reported in May. They are not afraid of the moat, which was dug on the spot under the order of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
Tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served as the path.
Insurgents in the neighborhood attacked Solihull's city council, saying it was "unable to solve the problem."
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “They occupied the site on Monday evening after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
Last night, more arrived, and today it will probably be even more.'
She added that: ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to continue paying taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: “It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last of the departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them and this time they brought horses with them.”
A spokesman for Solihull City Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are taking the necessary legal steps in cooperation with local police to successfully resolve the entire issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many local residents as possible report any unsocial or illegal police behaviour at number 101.
This will give us an overall picture that we will present to the court.”
A European woman's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special transports the injured Robert Zit<0xC5><0x88>ansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
Robert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer, according to TV YOJ.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xA1> from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians strengthen their fight against NGO rescue ships with migrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue ships of NGOs that arrive on the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea, unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
“If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities hijacked the German rescue ship Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, greatly facilitating illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates in its first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of the accusations made by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosio.
"For us, the number one priority is and always will be the rescue of human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on all the current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the entire situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring Jugend Rettet’s Iuventa vessel since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting migrants aboard the ship, which was handed over to them directly by human traffickers, over and over again.
According to the applicant’s file, at least one meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The meeting was reported by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta’s MOAS and Spain’s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable, as they do not represent any “substantial change or obstacle” to rescue operations.
The new code of conduct was also rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in migrants in recent weeks who disembark in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Unashamed Messaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: Silicone and cellulite are everywhere!
The hot summer days are quite tempting to take on only the essentials that will cover the most intimate parties.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just crouched, covered her body in a mini overalls.
And just a few normal movements were enough, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
In fact, how many times he cut her between the halves, moreover, he kicked her so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present was certainly not in need.
Michelle Carter Sentenced For Sending Text Messages Inspiring Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months from a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said in court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was kept at large until the decision.
She was threatened with imprisonment for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and cream blouses, Carter stood at the scene of the sentencing with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped and her eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t accept her own responsibility,” she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her performance.”
The applicant read a statement from Roy’s mother Lynn Roy: “It won’t be one day before I mourn the loss of my son.
"I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sister and we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever."
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy has testified that she is "persecuted" by the realization that she will never attend her brother's wedding and will never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is a pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in place that would hurt a person who helps another person commit suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014 poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case caught the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published, inciting suicide.
"I don't care if you're hanging out, jumping out of a building, or getting stabbed," Carter wrote in a text message she sent just two weeks before he died while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "Just hit the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted of charges.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi will adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to the sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW said the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, BMW's headquarters - considering a ban or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have been promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to a large extent to comply with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automobiles to install equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of smearing powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its vehicles, which reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was disabled.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at the engine development department at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and does not apply to him therefore extradited, he can therefore face legal proceedings in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation by the German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to bypass European emission limits – thus widening the accusations Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: a luxury car manufacturer makes up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profit.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
The man and the girl are dead.
The accident occurred on Praia de S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told SIC Noticias that the plane was flying close to the people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped alive and were taken by the police for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even completeable?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unreachable, even though it began to be built as early as 1978.
Even if it is not achieved, it is constantly being corrected.
It cannot be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, Castle Highway D11.
The construction of another section of it for at least a few months was stopped by the Children of the Earth movement.
We easterners get the highway piece by piece, like when they cut the salami.
The wheel will be trimmed and then we will see when and if we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks pass directly through the cities of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or N<0xC3><0xA1>chod, which is not as reasonably an object.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, that is, nine incredible years ago.
Not a beat since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of the unfinished section to Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové and other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> began to be built recently with the archaeological survey, that the construction will begin at the end of this year, you could hear loud banging of slings in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that there will be no construction this year.
And maybe next year.
The Children of the Earth-Klub movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed for dissolution.
The children of Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
Decisions on building permits were made on a full scale.
In the breakdown, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, from the D11 we descend near the village with the eloquent name of Po<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go down, we just go down the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to be included in the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Terrible, constantly clogged road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What do the Children of Earth want?
What is the essence of the problems of communication construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender became a symbol of Provence in the region of southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining as a result of a dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk, because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the shelf life of levandula.
This is also due to cicadas and grasshoppers carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates.”
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from it is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller.”
A possible solution may be more efficient distribution of water and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also the spraying of lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and the breeding of several species resistant to dry weather.
Murder of Journalists Highlights Growing Threats in Mexico
Employees of Riodoce meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the latest news about the unrest in the Sinaloa region, with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the pressure of recent events, they meet mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Choosing them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence does not stop and bodies are being carried out on a pile all over the country; journalists are constantly increasing among them: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 of them have been in power since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection and have been under attack since then; all of them are under federal protection and have been under attack.
Among them is also the co-founder of the magazine Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence, which is linked to the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, even though his presence is pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the middleman points, hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, a smile on his face.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, two suspects have so far been charged.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, and the killings of journalists are very rare.
Riodoca journalists insist that they will report on the violence taking place in Sinaloa; despite the fact that they are devastated and the said territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the intruders and without a view of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoca's headquarters in Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunmen then got into his car and knocked him down near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, the news seems to be spreading fast.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is only a suspicious silence.
Since Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n’s arrest last year and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi and the cemetery is full of sprawling two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "comfort" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, the co-founder and director of Riodoce, still complains that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two errors contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The peace could have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought all copies of the newspapers the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In Noroeste magazine, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up Riodoce together with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists liked to go in search of problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I feared for my life," he said as he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play a fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
The employees of Riodoce miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on his day-to-day routine.
He was always wearing his hat.
He often went to the bar of El Guayabo opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine blame his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like you messing with their wives, kids, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not playing here, shake hands.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "whose sense can be fooled . . . and then there's this thing with Javier."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloae, as they do in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoca employees meet, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in front of a forty-degree heat wave in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, which are located in a four-story building in the Culiacan quarter.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers are among those 50 percent of law enforcement officials who are, according to the government, corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last ventured into mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Sinaloa.
They are also focused on suspicious government spending that took place in the home town of the state governor.
Recently, several kidnappings took place in one of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the Attorney General’s office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were wary when they were going to write about what every inhabitant of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for almost a century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-ranking positions.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about past incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n's sons escaped an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez’s column, which was the best source of information about the abductions.
"Valdez would certainly have solved the case," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Miriam Ramirez, a journalist, grabbed several tickets and went to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor’s office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n state.
Only a burned body has been found, and authorities say it's Adame based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is increasing all over the country. Many of them organize protests and poke at the sidewalks and buildings "SOS press".
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is on a visit to Washington, D.C., where he seeks international support and justice after Valdez’s death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused authorities of monitoring journalists and their killings for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might endanger her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “bound” by organized crime, corrupt officials, and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed more than half of all attacks on police and public official journalists.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macias, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages.”
Next to the severed head lay the keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to end operations, such as the El Norte newspaper, based at the northern border of Chihuahua state in response to the March murder of news reporter Miroslava Breach.
Others continue to do so, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly stalking you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day represents a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It’s Friday midnight, and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office — the latest issue sent to the printer — sipping beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people were killed in a gunfight between gang members and a policeman near a beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens indicate another shooting.
Bojorquez glances at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't reveal it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their magazine - whose middle name is an eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an internist asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature about the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and reported that the dinosaur had a 'problematic past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is “the most well-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the genus Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by the researchers who described him as “really remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the armored beetle is still the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
The find is by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge chunk of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After completing the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“Just a little bit of blinking and you’ll believe you’re asleep,” said Caleb Brown, the head of the work, and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“It will certainly be recorded in the history of history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved species of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank — was highly likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that used many of today's animals.
Experts say that this allowed him to better merge with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a method of masking that is commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far exceeds that of today’s animals using the same technique.
It is possible, therefore, that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution gave the preference of masking over confrontation in survival.
Many modern-day masked animals — such as deer, zebras, or bandits — are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to fight for its surviving literal.
“The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur vividly illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin probably had a reddish-brown coloration.
Researchers are continuing to study the animal and are looking for more information about its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to find its last meal.
It is believed that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta area, the climate was the same as in present-day Florida, and the rivers and oceans were much further inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it’s completely covered in perfectly preserved skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
‘For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to close your eyes a little and it seems like you’re just sleeping.’
During the Cretaceous period, huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked around the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta’s body was washed out into the sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the chenix to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
There were two 50 cm blades protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of modern-day Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native of St. Louis sat on the bed in an Airbnb room and browsed Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else had written her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user retweeted her wall posts all the time.
The St. Louis rapper tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old man shot by a white-skinned police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying unruly on the street, from where no one had taken him after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her and her family.
She put down her phone to come back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim, holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead and his barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, was holding a gun with which he aimed at the crowd and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This is not the type of murder we’re used to and we can call normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes a new documentary "Whose Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and inviolability told from the point of view of people living in the community, who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell engaged in a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral suit and the same floral forehead - on a subject that had been discussed many times before - "about the experience with black people."
“Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?” she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old, and that's not right."
"It didn't come into my mind that I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination... of what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also needed to know the difference between the different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her.”
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on the South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of the activists, who were waiting for the words of policeman Darren Wilson about his possible participation in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared the food in bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell’s eyes, a new type of activism was slowly being born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food to black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met with the document’s later co-director, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?”
This type of skepticism penetrated into the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often forgotten, and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, who is a recognized local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the cell of death.
His participation in the project also intrigued Ferrell and, along with six other locals, who followed the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
“That was important to me – how these people will be represented – because in the same way I will be represented.”
While the goal of the document was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences — in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together,” Folayan said — it turned out to be she who is most open to participating in filming.
"Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking of the first moment she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and polish the blacks, I have to open up."
Ferrell’s story also emphasizes the role of the extreme black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement’s three founders – who created a social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in 2012 in response to the murder of teenager Trayvon Martin – call themselves freaks.
“Black women in extreme positions are ultimately behind the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black, eccentric women must bear the brunt of these events.”
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of disgruntled black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and that Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"That she was in the front lines is no accident, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on a two-and-a-half-year probation to block the highway during the demonstrations.
The social-political atmosphere in the area she calls home has been described as "disorder."
Yet she does not stop in her pursuit, which she has been committed to ever since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
There was a fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters came to the spot, and a helicopter helped.
Near <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at around 3:15 p.m., and firefighters declared a third level of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire spokesman Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, a helicopter was helping to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00 the firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hasit was also helped by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six water joists.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until tomorrow at 8:00 am he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is placed several faces of different skin shades - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them as if from the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from mouthwashes and hairs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning has sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, informatics and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left office.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a shrewd, if not intellectual, commentary on the subjectivity of DNA - as well as on the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the indescribable nature of DNA.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since she was young. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including breaking six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were taken by prison staff, and only one black-and-white, lower-quality photograph was leaked to the public, in which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to add a portrait to the article,” Dewey-Hagborg said at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, they were not allowed to visit or take photographs, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were reunited over a period of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibitions in person.
President Obama did indeed request Manning’s release a few days after the comic was released, a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It’s really interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who seek to publicize government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to instigate resentment in the areas he should be promoting with his tweets.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is pierced with the heart) after the end of "self-acting factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a hundredth of the letters C, G and A recorded by the pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
“I hope people will take it from us that our genome doesn’t matter who we are and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, placed in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging in the King Kong manner from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they prevent you from speaking, they will win," she wrote.
“Never let yourself be silenced.”
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goosebumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition – which was predicted in the comics – but when it does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic likenesses, arranged as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it.”
Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University staffer wanted for murder
A nationwide search is underway these days for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
An arrest warrant was issued on Monday for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records state.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died as a result of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police were alerted to this fact by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a murder, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University for Public Relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university's school grounds.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesperson said in an emailed statement: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole situation and wanted him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department’s public relations department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is on the rise," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a timesheet and victim profile and investigate various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long and that the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
“Currently, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the code - which describes the criteria for RUSADA's renewal - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that should worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls after the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are investigating as our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, so we can’t admit to something that never existed.”
Mutkov’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia’s RSport Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of conducting doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “on the right track” to regain its validity.
The police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting up a Wednesday fire at a rare wooden church in T<0xC5><0x99>inci-Guty in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>steck.
One defendant is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
Moravian-Silesian police director Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el.
He said the police would discuss the possible arrest of the accused.
Further information according to the director cannot be published.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigative staff and the public prosecutor who is supervising the case are actually working on the case," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will go to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Immediately after the fire began to think about the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, additional costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is being counted.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabov<0xC3><0xA1> also destroyed the fire fifteen years ago.
This caused a power failure at the time.
An exact copy was made in his place.
The state is counting on its citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for the associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state counts.
The Ministry of Defense, which received its processing as a task from the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This follows from the proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the defense.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, in addition to the exercise of the defense duty and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would financially or materially support the associations of amateur radio, shooters or cynologists and would enable them to increase the capacity of their members.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country for help at a time of crisis, and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also involves organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One of the possible variants assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state should use their capabilities only after the declaration of a state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of the previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," the statement said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable each citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of individuals, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent the imposition of force by improper conduct," he said.
The adoption of the law would bring a lot of financial demands.
Their amount, according to the ministry, will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office provides financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, it could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military headquarters would have to be extended, which would together employ an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a directive of the European Union on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And even though she promised anonymity to the survey, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, an e-commerce owner of San Francisco-based hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from the outside.
New human resources startups are constantly appearing on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee responsibilities, startups enable companies to make quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer full employee anonymity and a hotline for filing complaints, and in some cases also inform the public about them.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness in three years about what her employees think and feel.
In addition to quick surveys and voting by specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a casual overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies are starting to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the work environment - in case another Uber becomes one of them - which is thrown off in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who give up.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just ahead of Uber’s scandals.
Nearly 600 of Convercent’s clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has also recently taken the plunge.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customisable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The court of public opinion has regulators in place,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of mishandling its employees or unethical behavior — and if regulators fail to act — it may face costly consequences as a result of a customer boycott, employee exhaustion, or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problems, he had to search the phone number or email to the company management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, deputy general manager of Ruby Tuesday, who previously said there was no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it ensures rapid detection and resolution of issues that have never before been addressed to managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints – such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It’s getting closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing risk management.
"We are protecting shareholders from legal disputes by our employees."
Companies stopped taking employee ethics, values, and participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s downfall over employee ethical rights abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “you got social media on the whole thing” that societies began to realize that in the online world they couldn’t simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
“Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan said.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by the bold equity investors who have supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised a total of $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually raised $47 million.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy at their job, they feel their voice is being heard, and that their job is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors make money if companies succeed and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no surprise that there are plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if change doesn’t happen quickly – at worst – it can cause disappointment and disinterest in employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, which has witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
“Because once you don’t get things done, employees will start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to solve the problem within a day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and begin communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long run it will achieve high employment in a field that is known for frequent redundancies.
“If you don’t strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outpouring of customers, the whole company collapses."
Thursday was the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice on Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
He beat Tuesday, which was the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were surpassed or matched.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
Perhaps in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, today’s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records as well as the Guardian came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica there was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk<0xC3><0xA1>, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record was not exceeded.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>HMU website, today's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to rise only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
Current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've had such a mess here.
Billionaires don’t have the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>kovy Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Condemned corrupt and the king of Czech gambling Ivo Valent acquired the Party of Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> was not named by the mayor of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, is a chapter in itself.
The Mayors have also recently caught their billionaires.
It is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, the owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
But the entrance in the old-fashioned suit was not very good for Grandpa.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he told a news conference.
This means that my goal is to make the YES movement, to make the Mayor’s movement win 20% in the elections.
Leckdo smiled.
But my grandfather's retelling is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek is a man of firm opinions.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of voters in the Mayors jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
His grandfather supported Babi<0xC5><0xA1> in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is not a sharp-edged speaker and does not rule by the lovable rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
He is not in politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Grandma will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world, which he has under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new force, he confessed his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said he wanted the mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn’t change his mind and stands by his side no matter what jersey he’s wearing.
Others may speculate that Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is sending the Mayors to build his own casket of someone so impotent.
Others may ask if the head of Jablotron, for example, with the head of Agrofert, did not go out of business in a bad way and is not looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
My grandfather’s first public performance wasn’t just about my grandmother.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they say they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult to put a stop to such a statement.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, a judicially recognized looter, spent millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, TOP 09 and the civic democrats came together to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When Grandpa entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Then perhaps he would not have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
In his first days in politics, he crowned his grandfather with a proposal for a tax benefit for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to us every month for about fifty thousand people.
Those with a base of less than 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in this country's proportions.
The one with twenty poor.
In Grandpa’s vision of society, the poor pay taxes fairly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, in which they do not participate too much.
The rich simply need help not to deal with the misery of the needy.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Granny shake hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are not members of their party or citizens of the state are not entitled to their employees and their country to their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often not even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
With the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
He reported on the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid a place like no other.
But even the merger of a real estate company with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price fell to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands as about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin features 12 full-sized bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
However, with the new price, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, there are long days ahead
The eleventh morning is approaching, and UCLA football players are lining up at the sidelines of a new school playground.
Some of them undress their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, a sure sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members, these few minutes of idleness is a complement to the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will leave for the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting to be held on the upcoming morning at 6:30 a.m.
"The next three days are going to be great for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's jump on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That’s why the first three UCLA workouts are scheduled at 19:15 – to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent as a Westwood coach, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and training sessions are limited during the summer semester. His influence on it also has the decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled for August 20, and formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team begin in September.
Mora was heard to support the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already loaded players' diary.
"For three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everybody's trying. They're great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when you look at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after collecting the protective net behind the goal bar.
Bruins players should be occupying the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our workouts.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security guards, as well as parking no. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe that everything will work out well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook plans to take a closer look at the facts to limit the number of fake news stories
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under the original posts in an effort to combat so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect potential hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the president of the United States.
Political debates are taking place in Europe. French voters are flooded with fake news about the May presidential election and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not quickly remove the angry post.
Facebook said in a statement in Germany on Thursday that it plans to launch testing of a new fake news control feature in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to viewing third-party-verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” Sara Su, product news manager at Facebook, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
The Making of a Graphic Novel: The Story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle played the lead role in Squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher took refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in Kent, England, which inspired the quirky Jamie Rhodes of York County – known for his love of historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“Looking at a man’s handwriting 300 years after his death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library's documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the fingerprints on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months at the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing through the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on a wall and bottles that had been thrown away for centuries in a moat.
He walked around the grounds and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the hajni, gardeners and sometimes also to artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drinked whiskey and wrote."
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “aristocrats of many centuries are throwing up their hands with the words: ‘Put it in the attic’.”
Newspapers, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: “You may think the land dispute is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case where two families were dragging along the birch tree.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and dig deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
“I found a record of the revolt at the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes said.
“The English rebellion actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it’s somehow related.”
Other stories are firmly linked to the castle's history - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a casket with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the casket was discovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the men of that time were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family solved this by taking rich or old ladies - I imagine it was the handsome gentlemen who were fond of biting the heads of the heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, he searches for Rhodes after other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book on El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was engulfed in nature.
This is a very special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
“I thought, ‘Now I’m going to go back to real life.’”
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump about the new immigration plan of the United States, under which there will also be a change in the granting of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 annually as a result of stricter rules on granting temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will give priority to English-speaking applicants who are infused with financial resources and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country,” Trump said in a statement.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should beware
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots appears on the Internet.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are very popular right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look at the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot nails.
“People are pulling out of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids change from inflating pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence, which mimics human behavior.
The user can "edit" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame the Stepford lady as well.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the robot RealBotix can set up different character traits for his replacement wife, including shyness.
And then there's True Companion's Roxxxy Gold sex robot woman, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the "frigid Farrah" who has a shy nature and the "wild Wendy" with a "benevolent" nature.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible,” the True Companion website states.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or be “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - among which there is no confusion about real interpersonal relationships. Rather disturbing are the inferior female character traits and violent connotations - e.g. frigid (even defiant) Farrah.
The company True Companion on its website likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture – a shift away from ideal or gender equality towards the desire for seductive sex with an optional extra.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in the modern age.
And most people aren’t weird or violent until a free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world are exercising their rights and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very defamatory towards women.
The scariest aspect of The Handmaid's Tale isn't what we see - the hanging bodies and darkened eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should look as much as possible like real women (even with the degree of a porn actress).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot can’t replace the real woman.
They can’t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history, nothing that would incentivize their independence or interfere with their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
In the 21st century, service.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose, despite the packed first shot at the premier start among professional golfers.
The double award-winner for the NBA's most useful player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower-tier Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, first round at 74 and will fight for the cut.
Golden State, who won a second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, yet with a balance of four shots over the pair he left a dozen professionals behind.
"It wasn't an ideal way to get started, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it settled down a bit," Curry said, with a huge tremor falling on him.
It was very nerve-wracking to shoot the first shot at the tournament, but that was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to break through with a cut that is likely to be set two under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've gotten rid of the threes, I think it's going to work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
An unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-scale, tear entire families apart.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspaper ran with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
All we're supposed to do is wait for him to let us down.
Less attention, however, is given to Trump’s family’s ability to melt.
I’m talking about it because my cousin, a poet and left-wing fan who lives in Chicago and has paid for a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that face-to-face numbness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family — including all of the Republican siblings with whom she’s squabbled about politics for years — is on the same wavelength.
At dinner at the family table, it’s a good thing; but I’m surprised that in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his crooks may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there’s an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, in opposition to his standards, will suddenly embody what might be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild excesses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it is enough for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest swing operated by the New York Parks Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with glass laminate - clowns and animals are filming and looking at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy view and the zincy music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon fade away: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panoramas are glancing, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you and the reality of the city is not getting to your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn’t get carried away by the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually Swiss cheese – it doesn’t count the themed Ye Olde Swiss Cottage pub – but London’s subway station.
However, the ride in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, have a great time at it.
If I could evaluate the wheel, he would have earned the most points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “inconsistency” on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can put 15% propitious for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to rub in favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized with a smile when I reluctantly assessed my credit card handover with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for stab wounds to his wrist, which the prison said he caused himself after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to re-appeal, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecution Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of the sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young captive panda that was bred in the wild.
The panda rescue program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genofond panda kept in captivity.
A staff member at the Chang Chi-chung Center told the New China News Agency that the panda’s breeding is at great risk from a related cross-breeding.
At the end of last year, there were only 471 prisoners.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to keep the captive pandas from colluding with the wild ones is the first step in helping to protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the Panda's mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met her Chosen One 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males miscalculate the time when the female is ready, moreover, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on 1 August in the early hours of the morning by the Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.

In Kingsbarns, Scotland, the field was beaten one time under par by three birdies and two bogeys.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player hopes to pass the cut at the famous major for the first time.
Entering the competition with a $3.25 million grant came out best to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the field record of 64 runs, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA, according to Reuters, said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, meaning 80 percent of eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also joined the closure of breeding, have not been exported to the Czech Republic recently.
Veterinarians will, however, take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problematic insecticide brands have appeared.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-bladder preparations, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and is looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," laughed the 27-year-old Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in a Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n jersey.
It depends on whether he gets engaged by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to rate it as a school, I'd rate it as three.
The first year I didn’t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've learned.
The second year, I started catching.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more room.
But they brought a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch it all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only got maybe five points, so the coaches started shooting.
At the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
What was life like in Riga?
That's wonderful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a friend there.
We're in our third year together, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play for free.
They shoot less, and although they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done so that you play like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even if it didn't work out, there were a lot of people walking.
Did the presence of Dinamo in the KHL help Latvia to almost advance to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there from the beginning.
And from that time on, their results for the World Championships began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada close to 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Roberts Bukarts took the lead and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not a baseball player, they're really good.
Here teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still not engaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it another way.
The only question is when and where I will sign.
How real is the variant that you will start a new year in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what's up.
Now I can't wait to see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season was not one for me to choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government flight to Let's go on.
In January of this year, I wrote an article about the camp in Lety near Orl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the main passages of the article.
We have been talking about the camp in Lety for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is about, it will probably be best if they look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument South Place Leta.
There, at the beginning of the historical record, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Leta, that from 8. 8. 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1. 1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 it became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were put into Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp was transported 370 people.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, which in turn caused them human beings and twisted ideologies.
There is no question that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is also no dispute that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 70s of the 20th century a pig was built near and on a part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and destroy pork, but this has not happened yet.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to shut down the pig.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
Until last autumn, the government approved the purchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy pork.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably dream of those intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it won’t be a cheap affair.
At the same time, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is apparently not a threat, it would, in my opinion, be a waste of money.
Does the government have any other priorities?
The monument, a worthy place of worship, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wants to can worship the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the lunch place with the utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the entrusted property, i.e. also the taxpayers’ money, with the care of the proper owner.
At least, as in my own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year, I took a look at the site.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own dining area, which is made of stones placed on a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, how it looks and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, it would not be possible to preserve some of the discovered bases and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could exert his efforts.
If he succeeds in the government to push for the purchase of pork for state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support the resistance of the intestines, which is why it has been shown to reduce the risk of developing cancer.
The study’s lead author, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the scales are tilted to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory disease of the intestine can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells that promote body tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one type of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a certain type of immune cell supporting body tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately cells were missing.
She deduced that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome — a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were tested by DNA sorting, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
The mice, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cell - were given the L. reuteri bacteria - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid—without the bacteria—to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of a tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octave acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After splitting the doses of tryptophan, at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
"Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing Nemanj Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his move to Manchester United to be ‘genius’
Manchester United have won in their team "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the defender made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40m contract, claimed a 2-1 win in the first match in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a backer alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> did not have a form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be worked on before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, he's smart and he's got brilliant thinking - he's thinking football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get fit as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindel<0xC3><0xB6>f and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"I thank the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
“Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did the most for me.”
The life challenge of the King of chicken skins Ladi Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The promising image began to be drawn thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Academy.
The pear immediately blew the chance.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to apply to your cooking academy because, hand in hand, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two have been at their peak for several years, La<0xC3><0xB0>a hasn’t forgotten to tease him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is a favorite," said Hrushka.
He is really serious about his participation in Pohlreich’s new show.
It's time to move up the ladder and learn from the master.
'The question is, what's the boss, 'said Lightning.
However, Pohlreich did not express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima reacted to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka's participation in the culinary academy with the fact that she takes the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ko Pohlreich was struck by his first cook in December 2004.
Within a few days, more than 300,000 pieces were sold to her!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcast schedule, is a non-false cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from among the audience and in twelve works he introduces them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the chef cooks in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k had a crossed pear sprinkled on the back of his shirt.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile at that pear - pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," La<0xC4><0x91>a said.
The art of cooking is on its own.
"Cooking according to L<0xC3><0xA1>da Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka is not even considered at home, because at home I will not run a gastropunk," the boss says clearly.
I really appreciate Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Pohlreich, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka did not forgive himself.
He's an idiot!
He's not a cook to me, he's a television clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or a moron," Pohlreich said of Hru<0xC5><0xA1>kov in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand at them, but I don't solve them any more," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door of the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
The procedure of implantation and adherence to treatment procedures is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a door lock replacement service and microchip compatible cars. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House props cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came at $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17th program at the White House, which was a showcase of U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials watched the show of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" incident, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records said.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, a representative of the Navy's Air Force commander, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire site is completely cleared, which was scheduled between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that in the event of a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flights due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening along with the helicopter and with them also a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the weekly TIME - it was not clear whether the second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were sure that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," the deputy commander wrote.
The "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the president advocated health reform, which was passed by the Senate, and talked about trying to keep the government regulations in check.
The use of air transport, such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for the sake of presentation is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was in the background at his first meeting as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is plagued by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which showcased products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials,” said press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn, rehearsing possible flights with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew’s current training, the state official said.
On the same day, the helicopter’s unit was on “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House said no additional props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
Spokesman Sikorsky said the company was not in any way interested in the negotiations for the South Lawn helicopter exhibition.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact costs associated with the parade are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is $24,380 per flight hour, replacing DoD expenses for VH-3D.
The unit's records show a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below that amount.
"Indicate the costs of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said of the case.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for DoD expenses do not include staff costs, but include fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
The then White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the show.
“The idea of this week’s show is to introduce products made in the U.S.,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in producing.
This fact should be remembered.”
It is not clear whether Trump was also seen on a helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn. With certainty, it can only be said that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three of them myself."
A young woman tied up in a swamp by Lake Mach, the police were sailing to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2 a.m.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the urine.
When she decided to ask for help from a police officer on her mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," police spokesman Ivana Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Several police patrols went to the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police officers had to navigate hundreds of meters of raccoon urine before they felt a solid ground again under their feet," Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
And so it was missed as well.
The police were orienting themselves according to which direction her call for help was coming from.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down out loud," the spokeswoman said.
The police found the woman at three-quarters of five in the swamps in the locality of Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the edge of physical and mental strength, showing signs of hypothermia.
That is why the ambulance took her to the Czechoslovak hospital.
Grandfather's connection to STAN?
From the desired bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project, sledameslusny.cz, as if a billionaire was basically telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also claimed that the politically uncoordinated party, rather less known mayors and independents, does not actually have any national program for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after interviewing her Grandfather, whatever political opinion she may have.
This is how Bart started, and it didn't work out very well.
With his drive for decent people and personalities, which may replace some mayors on the candidates, as admitted by Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k, in addition, Grandpa also cancels the popular argument of the head of the STAN that the most important value of the movement is the political verification and experience of the mayor, traditionally the most popular politician and according to the polls.
They are now calmly replacing the quickly collected unknown personalities.
The total separation with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if only a few people suspected STAN of identity at that time, after the arrival of Grandpa, only the game of identity ends.
Not only was Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k long delineated against the YES of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but the Grandfather, who publicly praises Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, stated the following: "My goal is that the YES movement, i.e. the Mayor's movement, will gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is definitely not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babis, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time, STAN has been more reminiscent of a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make the bride she wants even more of a sales girl.
For a while STAN went with the TOP 09, then with the people and now he is looking for decent people for change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police Dogs Trained in Bridge Overflights by Helicopter
Dogs specialized in the search for explosives and search dogs today practiced at the lake Bridge overflights by helicopter.
The police dog must not be fearful and afraid of flying, said Petr Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of police cynologists in the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge, both the adult training dogs and those who are just passing through the training were trained.
In addition to standard training, which was to reveal sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for a missing figure, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter's path.
"The helicopter gets bored, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately on the way by helicopter is excluded from training.
"Most of the time they are left by the dogs, for example, in the garden," added Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The police have 76 dogs in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region with different specialties.
German sheepdogs are dominant, but Belgian sheepdogs are also growing.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," added Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal possible medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and uncaring, it passes the first test in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
Most of the time, they live with their dogs.
Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix's hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar’s killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already been received for the third and fourth season - the first-named has already received the first trailer and the installation of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA will focus on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” with the only difference being that they scale violent acts and pay more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of liaison with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character who recruits American and Colombian rights activists in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
Elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of the society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said hundreds of women are taking part in local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if women are also involved, as well as all related processes related to the elections.
The presidential and local elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activity to the second round.
In this year’s elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government transfers its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer in a restored brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought back to life a few years ago a brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>a near M<0xC5><0xA1>en.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted to steam engine operation.
The years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was done by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and disassembled into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hope shone in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov<0xC3><0xBD>ch.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded with the declaration of a brewery for a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was officially renewed.
If you want to taste a great lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>nska, visit the beer cellar.
When brewing beer, they use coriander water from the protected landscape, malt from the lobbies and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
In the creek you will taste the traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half-time.
The largest artillery fort in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclér, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babi.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by vast underground.
There was to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammunition, material, a power plant, a machine shop and a hospital.
However, the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive iron-concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see here.
The underground is already accessible from 75%!
Part of the complex is in addition to the T-S 73 infantry wharf with exposure and underground and an armed light fortification object, in addition to two deployed infantry wharfs, trenches and the educational path Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's harbor near Rome or the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a huge four-winged building of a convent above a beautiful garden.
The list that he got, but unfortunately belongs to the unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
Survivors, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Evening for the Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k, Ivan Hlas, among others, will perform, you will see a ceremonial performance and you will look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbariums as well as ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered on a walk, this application will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the Center for Ethics and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the project Secret Life of the City.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with their teachers to the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said project coordinator Ivana Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which will then be assigned under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome that after creating an account, users contribute to the application with an image of a plant that does not yet exist in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
Trade unions are demanding assurances from McVitie's cookie makers about a long-term manufacturing commitment at a Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent on any investment in the Tollcross plant for the time being.
The factory has more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, cookies Hobnob and Rich Tea.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes to the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company, the Scottish GMB unions expressed concerns that McVitie's "will not deliver on its promises to finance and modernize production lines."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the builder regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the local factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of jobs, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie’s.”
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “Constructor Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in Tollcross, particularly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local location and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factory, the employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to take their side in their attempt to win back <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of its record-breaking incursion already three years ago?
The Ligue 1 club is poised to surpass more than double Paul Pogba's previous record transfer to Manchester United, which paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world – after tax, he will charge PSG more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has broken his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to comply with Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best players in PSG.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we’ll definitely reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face consequences."
Barcelona seem to have crossed a line when they expressed interest in PSG defender Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will they allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill with the departure of Neymar for his bold actions.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely-understood rules?
Donald Trump has called for sanctions against Russia.
The day before, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And the day before, Trump had written that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat, and that it would not continue to do so.
It also clears up the idea of sanctions like mud from shoes.
These things can't be thrown in one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has indeed embarked on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not doing what the US president wants it to do.
Russia is a chapter in its own right.
But if someone wanted to sum it up in such a way that even an ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, understands what it is and what system of rules the policy of sanctions is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only applies what President Obama has already done, only he has given it an implementation stamp.
So why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the U.S. election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but tightened.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions are in violation of international law.
It's like kosher is just sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions so weak they don't threaten anyone?
The ordinary voter's a loser.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the armistice in Ukraine.
It is now known that this is the EU’s energy security.
The electorate is growing even wider.
There are sanctions against Russia for being too mounted where it does not have.
China is being undermined by the fact that it is mounting little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the order or the rules?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I do not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all the candidates are already ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere with them at all.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian school run by the headmaster and shadow minister of education YES Ivo Vondr<0xC3><0xA1>k.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member of Parliament or a Governor," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> confirmed his earlier position.
You have angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run the towns and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we directly elect the president and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book I do not talk about disturbing representatives, they can easily be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When presenting your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard on my own that you were talking about the abolition of representative offices.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of building little and not preparing large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government, which in our history has been governed by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
I’m not saying they did it well.
The current prime minister is not running anything, he is just moderating the debate.
Then it can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to put it down.
In the program, we only have a change to the one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of ministers and a regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure to prevent unnecessary displays by Members, who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be shown at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that is exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will rule the government, control the House with 101 deputies, abolish the provinces and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, control the entire country.
I'm sure it isn't.
After all, there is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced the reduction of the legislative body by a third, while there are 57,000 French on one legislator, while in our country it amounts to 17,000 Czechs.
Macron, however, is not being accused of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The fees for those who have a parliamentary majority, however, are large, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no threat of this in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for the people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they outvote me and add 21% to the GIBS, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you have thought of that as a prime minister?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency and would like to do business for the money of the state, like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers in the government are not supposed to argue, they are supposed to express their disagreements outside of it.
The cabinet must go to the finished material, there is no room for coalition splits, power voting and business, there it is to decide.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mainly party-oriented?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking the bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and kicked Babis out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has management skills, a similar plan gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even if I don't know what I've done so terrible.
There is so much skepticism out there.
The mayors have acquired a businessman, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the peoples maybe he will win the wing of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
I don't think so.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, who does not exclude the coalition with the ANO, in the ODS V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus ml., who also will not mind.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President YES Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamurovs come to mind as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, he ran as a puppet of V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta for VV, then he got money for his company from Dawn, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a significant personality.
It's a bit brown, though.
If I take his program, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, it can be agreed.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, who speaks at demonstrations with whistleblowers and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about cooperation with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
It is clear that he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the pair.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's go back to your quest to become a company.
But the government just has to be in control, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, he has never made a decision.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ took control of the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ general meeting.
If you became Prime Minister, would you change the staffing of the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not him yet.
It is said that <0xC4><0x8C>EZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for an even better one with YES.
After the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a humble lobbyist or a Rosary, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer it directly.
If you become head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, that is, the institutions you criticize?
I would like <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wants for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look into Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to be in the CEZ majority, he's never run it, he's only been there in numbers, which is bad.
This is a trivial matter for me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, to appreciate them, to push them into the subsidiary, to arrange financing, to make a supplier competition or to acquire a co-investor and to build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don’t and won’t have any competence to throw anyone out.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I’m just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television fees, but they don’t really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at the way these reports are being discussed, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission for leaks from investigative files and to lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousko push me out of the government, which added to the TOP 09 percent, but the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took them.
They are afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of the YES Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek builds his power base by putting his son on the supervisory board of Tepl<0xC3><0xA1>ren Brno and arranging for a related lawyer Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hl<0xC3><0xAD>n contracts with urban and state companies, such as Prague’s Czech Railway Company?
We have a permanent dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I've blamed it on him several times.
Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek argues that the lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>lov<0xC3><0xA1>, B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
If we had any indication of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
