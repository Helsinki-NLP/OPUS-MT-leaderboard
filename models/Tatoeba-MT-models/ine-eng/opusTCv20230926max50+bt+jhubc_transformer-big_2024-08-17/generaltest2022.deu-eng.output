The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the goods value test....
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and so it is not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions on what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs 179<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to take on a role as parents for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help a little, bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be children, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is on its own for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can decide for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours when he falls asleep.
Legally, it’s probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes along.
Because if something really happened like a fire, a burglary, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but the title everywhere doesn’t want to happen to me anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who after a brief investigation to his therapist who operates a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is tasked anonymously before each suicide to go and document the place of the suicide and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately the patients face their fear in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window and another leaves with the intention of dying)
This fear is referred to in the book as “the fight.”
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the rough plot I’m pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone, or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh yeah, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference returned?
Child, 4 years old, splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, has wood splitters under the thumb nail over the entire length (outside).
I tried to pull him with a tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn’t work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chances.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost every locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker in addition to a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders log on to a suitable digital power station fully automatically.
It controls all DCC programming modes, and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read out with matching centers.
For centers that can only program the CVs from 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 rides at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compliant centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the M<0xC3><0xA4>rklin<0xC2><0xAE> braking distances as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU braking commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DC-brake modules or with DC voltage.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC automatic commuter train allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog direct and alternating current paths.

Omikron: Johnson wants to push for freshening
More and more new Omikron cases are bringing politics and science to the UK.
By the New Year, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccination offer.
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on coronavirus vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers than he has been aiming for so far.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was the end of January.
The UK government will also provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the Omicron variant, one is facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's get you excited now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm for everyone to introduce themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step on the feet of an official.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today can't go
Obviously, the chair had an inconspicuous lack of sales.
How can such a padded damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only on the #PRS_ORG# try.
But it has been working since ca.
No more 14 days.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact more often with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A subject that really nudges me and unfortunately is far too common that many victims can not be helped or think we could not help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, I can not reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, in some cases even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to say about "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a stunning look: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was confident.
Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, it did not settle after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the bare result disappointed the way in which the performance was performed.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma was mentioned as a substitute: the three-rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick replied, “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and didn’t implement what we trained.”
To move the ball.
His reaction to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "To win a horny game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago".
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and managed the game of his team.
“The best player I’ve ever coached,” Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already lagged behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there isn’t much time left to chat.
Already on Wednesday (19:00), the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written to them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hit songs from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert was postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned during the Advent period must also be included, as is the case on the singer’s website, which today turns 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then want to catch up on their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in L<0xC3><0xBC>nen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has sung a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow musicians.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of beats and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women this is not a problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and considered etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music landscape is inconceivable.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It will be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check in advance whether it fits in color
It still does not work I can only crave the cover sheet but do not leaf.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created through expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a popular decision in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the Daily Mirror.
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is by the way the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening in rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, “we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps”, stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
The product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it ever come again?

Voucher sounds great
Then I will redeem it independently on the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipment itself take?
I've already cut myself on the finger
This is an absolute ugliness
At Least 100 Killed by Tornadoes in Kentucky
In the event of a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to be lamented.
The pictures are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the U.S. caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, that wherever the tornado had been through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
In Kentucky alone, he estimates up to a hundred dead, with official figures rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that she is sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it taken out of the range altogether?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this is arrived or processed, since I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the German government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have themselves taken the initiative and are offering monetary premiums to their employees for vaccination.
This is in line with the social partners of the <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccine calls – following the German model – is also intended to increase the readiness for corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company that he slandered.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn’t get stuck in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can't do that.
And that he didn’t like you at the time: well, it doesn’t matter.
He didn’t like his job well either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm going to do a screen shot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to you!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on the adventure about the Gripen Pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are invented and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a truckload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action will take place.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins lure the heroes into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the Goblins look up the heroes in a hollow path and flank to each three left and right me arches armed the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject, I have two approaches to the solution
The heroes are all found and healed unconsciously and then by the son of the village school, a half.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half will attack with two of his servants and come to the aid of the heroes in the battle.
The car is still there, everything is great.
What do you think of Deus ex Machina’s solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start an adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to share many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I turned the lamp off again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway
If you can send the tickets back, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage room part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
For the first time today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind the schedule, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else must be limited, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the finish line.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio lines on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this possibility existed for Verstappen.
In my opinion, such elementary rules should be known simply when you comment on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both of which simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, do not like with the artful comment style of Roos, but admit that it is a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant aberrations that make both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of anxiety to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the ad simply takes over at Sky, in the exit round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV because only the German soundtrack without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Also, these two channels in the trainings make less advertising than Sky, and this as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, except for advertising, RTL does a better job at the four races that they are still allowed to transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
To the right: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Ventilation pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model of fan pump, but they also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, soundproof design and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or the like... and it can already be started.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards once the water runs out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, you, like other air pumps, should be covered and protected from moisture
MK Series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we indicate here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is confused, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in forwarding... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate as bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scold these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in bright?
Amazon Founder Bezo Sends Astronaut Daughter and Moderator to Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly-chosen astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: Space Engineer E.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew in like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, sometimes with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-out: On the first of July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In the second in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also in attendance, along with former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I already informed myself before studying about career prospects, but I also thought at the time that I definitely want to study until the doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (student check etc) you hear again and again great job opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That would really interest me:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your feedback!
At the moment, I am really unsure and I am considering discontinuing my studies in 2022 and taking a training course as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience, please write it again :)
Extra stress before holidays & weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That’s why I have a post about it now.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in the company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week Maria was Ascension, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week we had a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails that absolutely had to come out before boarding, order here order there, everything *definitely* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that's not allowed to be?
Or because people want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also very stressed out.
What is this self-preservation for the holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can’t afford them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent on it.
My question is simple: are we the only ones who are Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but still has no gifts.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the party by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
But until the contemplative days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of the mousses and the rejuvenation of the feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the feather damage that occurs in poultry farming is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the feather is made of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during mowing are due to a lack of or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the administration of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR-handlaarbeitmodel Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and missing parts see photos, good function, the series E 95 is a heavy goods vehicle
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally reworked
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tactile bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens shock absorbers with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn amelioration plant Dessau, the reworkability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger numbers were first preferably constructed.
It was only when the E 94 saw that the number of work-up could not be further increased that the E 95 became the focus of the work-up.
[4]At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They came to the Halle P. railway station in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan, mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
Thus, it often happened that shooters remained glued during shift actions.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly driving on this locomotive, had to release the gunner with a hammer and wooden wedge during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of breakdowns in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives in existence at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electric plant was planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter types, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one-many, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visual conditions of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were last replaced by the E 95 01, which took office on 5 October 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switchgear heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time before those responsible for the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was initially reworked with the aim of presenting it for a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operating museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational development of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external coating, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching minor sections, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Hand-made model H0 in OVP, good function, it is necessary optical rework on the locomotive in its own work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare hand-made model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and bearing traces.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent off?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones of the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I have them sent?
Hello #NAME#, can I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech county).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not proceed from a deliberate incendiary attack.
Kripo F<0xC3><0xBC>rstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it will come much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To discourage fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin posted on social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not publicly stated his vaccination status so far.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness had moved him to do so, Shahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
On social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine,” <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me in which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe COVID-19 illness and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not currently legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritization has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to his own information.
Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire broke out at a refueling station.
After a fire with severe damage in a refueling station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to run out of electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities went out of the lights due to the fire.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators had been in operation until the large-scale fault could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for help from the neighborhood.
The caretaker thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their service.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for their tireless efforts," Florian Witt, head of primary technology, said in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will still take a few days, as the Westnetz-Monteurs were initially able to restart some lines only provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 19.15 on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid switchgear station.
There, complex cleaning and repair work is required.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back on.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Rupichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been connected gradually from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the failure has also been available.
Over 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or single people and report to the local fire brigades when help is needed," Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) said after a crisis meeting.
The focus was on the installation and operation of emergency power generators, especially the residents of Altenheimen.
In addition, according to the authorities, care places in schools were temporarily set up for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.

But I can't mount the chassis on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
Of these, there are 3 versions.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t push it into each other and thus shorten it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
Yes, it's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Send me the return e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit score almost impudent.

To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry off.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface area.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
As a result, unrealistically effective surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might come through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal veils can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you put them in.
The models achieve an original look through the decals or decals.
From government badges on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models, the Decals give the model its final touch.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still within reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are in sticking time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and fix it for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly moisten their backs with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then you push the picture just a small piece of paper and put the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Caution: Always check if the picture is correct before you push it off the paper completely so that it does not stick to your finger, crack or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household towel.

Care for children with PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in child care for some time, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, it suddenly comes across.
The order of:
We had applied for the children's wish list in advance at the PKV and received the promise about 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but these did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost of the car and again received 3 further tests.
After a few more attempts (we have made more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are charged with the car) we paid the bills to the car and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the car wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child request is a new insurance case.
However, according to the General Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is entitled here to the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the pledges that with one birth the further attempts will lapse?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts gave their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to best reach them again?
It's all right.
We will not order anything from you anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
You can pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I guess I can't do anything about the fact that the dresser comes to me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to purchase another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find these at your site.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is exactly, for that there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what might not please you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you!
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will give up again soon because it just does not work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a “half victory” in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus’ border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, said the researcher of the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This state of affairs - Belarus does not pay very little attention, but the EU feels like a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a Member State gets in the head to do its thing," as is currently the case in Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A principled agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "Border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
A renewed attempt to cross the border
According to Polish border guards, migrants have once again tried to cross Belarus into Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials had been stoned by the migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border guards tried to cross the border within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk of having attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border crossings.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the limelight and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared to ensure that the security apparatus regularly locks thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi – After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows suggest two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken in violation of regulations.
A second objection was raised against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had reached his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you
Thanks for the support

At the age of 21, he leaves behind Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
At the age of 24, Verstappen celebrates his first World Championship title at the Formula One finals in Abu Dhabi - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final round.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noises at her front door.
Yesterday I gave up the contact form to return an article, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It’s like when a farmer says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both will not admit your i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just let it go completely.
Wow, you’re not as serious as your co-worker.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just cramming nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take any further seriously as a colleague
In order to maintain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatically-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass up to the edge zone virtually free of directory and color errors.
Frequently, magnifiers are marked with magnifications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the package).
Light reflexes are generated on the lens surfaces of all optical devices – even in the case of impact lenses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Sale of fir trees in Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some strange situations when selling fir trees.
Once, a man is supposed to have gone home without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Each year, he plants about 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little bit funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Am I going away as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which by far does not sound so tasty.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit correctly, except for a few failures.
The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLAN module connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, on the other DLAN module, which sends out the wifi, the more the full 500 arrives, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less it arrives (that is, use a socket, which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiberglass so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it’s time to change your checking account
Who would have thought that now, for the first time, there would be rest at the giro accounts, looks deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm their past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she just halved the free amount and even quartered it for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group’s Postbank division – to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Verivox internet portal, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance have even been entitled to this regulation before the Regional Court of Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that even the top authorities declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston takes on a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, has been named the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she gave herself a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a unique chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having bad luck with luck - and still looking for the great love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
She was always asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
Let’s hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen must give up
Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen’s departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre touch, R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after less than half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've calculated this once, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina in 2026," said the double-Olympic winner from the BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Only on Saturday, he defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting slightly and took a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg) and Alexander Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ller (SV Halle), he was ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We went at greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also imported his 22nd win in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to second place earlier this time on to fifth place.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte scored her third win of the season in two bobsleigh on her home field.
After only reaching fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced for the World Cup on Sunday at the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
BRC Thuringia’s Mariama Jamanka came in second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she took the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama is taking me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said, stressing: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around."
Jamanka was a little upset about the not entirely error-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn’t receive it and therefore couldn’t redeem it either, which is why I finally asked.
Because of Corona, I had quite a different problem last year and never had time for it.
And now he said it was over, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare sofa.
I would like to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivered item.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one or the other is like that...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - once apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we kissed a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burning).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now it’s time to do some housework, which we naturally split up.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is just fine, I'm half well treated and I'm fine.
Not good, but I'm fine and almost symptom-free.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the following morning anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, does it all go on?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed out that I need these mental cues because otherwise I’m packing the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do it...
Are you okay with that?
Honestly, I’m infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Thank you so much, I can’t put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think this has a lot to do with women’s mental load and that’s why I thought I’d find a lot of sympathy here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Today I got my order unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed in school at the time that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject such as mathematics or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised a Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just found it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn’t believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Please write in English that I understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd refrain from it
It's okay, thanks.
I expect to receive a response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
The other is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live for himself, I mean.
The transition is, I think, also the soldier's grave.
In the end, both soldiers fight each other.
If that tells you something, I’m grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Just relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around, no cuddly animals, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child while he or she sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it rise from the stomach out of something?
Or is it with the face in front Directly in the mattress?
You can tell if everything is all right.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was like walking and putting the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "customer" with you and have already bought many items
But why do you offer me only 20 euros?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has made a lot of promises.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be held.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just that the politics of this channel is now under all the lash.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno: "You don't want to be a running litfa<0xC3><0x9F> column."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can, of course, continue to offend people.
A Krogman who lacks empathy and tries to make ash at the expense of the action with the exploding rented rooms.
How to find all this well?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a callback as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for cuddling – My little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and release dosed again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The Kirschkern pillow with cover is suitable as a heat storage exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odor, stick or fire spots and immediately dispose of them if present.
Please take the inner pillow out of the cover before warming up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Spread the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking immediately after heating!
Then cover the inner pillow in the cover.
During the first warm-up, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this may disappear with repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Check before heating the pillow in the microwave that a heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow to suit babies (max. 43 °C) at your arm arch!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, haemorrhoids and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is enough for operation.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply plugged in.
After that, I expanded the battery, but here, too, nothing is done.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don’t know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still with a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 liters of capacity also swallows larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need for everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without latching the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to worry about the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is supposed to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting for the email from your support.

If you extend my voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but after all I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year went differently than I thought I could not guess and I just could not redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotating brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined mechanically (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is directed with the balancing of the pane according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tinted discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic characteristics of our tinted discs emphasize the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing boulders in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were set aside, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You’ll look for gold, recruit workers, assemble horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that is more and more "working for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can use fine adjustments to develop your individual playing style.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables the half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players alternately perform actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the Promoter turns to a new location and changes the available actions.
This goes on until the auctioneer has moved five times, so each location has hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is made.

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately looked at it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible can never, never, never! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of the test obligation for triple-vaccinated people
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple-vaccinated people.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the test obligation can be waived for three times vaccinated people," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chair of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is “not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate,” Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Ministers of Health on Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Warning: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page goes to the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be?
What you describe is called “awareness,” meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common are hearing sounds/voices, the rarest are seeing images and the rarest are experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the navel is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned at the anaesthesia appointment.
Certain anaesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 doesn’t help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I sent you an email that you did not reply to.
Again the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver at the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I do not know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Am I not called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian G<0xC3><0xBC>nther R<0xC3><0xBC>hle dies at 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
On Friday, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther R<0xC3><0xBC>hle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theatre historian and journalist G<0xC3><0xBC>nther R<0xC3><0xBC>hle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I already testify here my life thanks".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not charged
New York wins MLS championship for the first time

Routing Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
This was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn’t that good anymore, but I get it.
IIt is about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not come to me.
Would you please check there.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the L<0xC3><0xBC>beck area
For many people, goose or duck is part of the Christmas holidays such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the L<0xC3><0xBC>beck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level and the breaking content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything about "gain" and distortion.
Further above, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve if it goes unashamedly loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headphone or with direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally spend a VFS5 footswitch, you can also conveniently call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tap" the tempo of the accordingly compatible effects.
In fact, this is essential for live betting.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it in others like that.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iran, progress has been made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told IRNA news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement continued after a week-long break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to be above the mark of 1000 at the corona incident on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had last always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value on Sunday was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely behind with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
As the delivery will only take place in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this and stick it on the package and deliver it to the post office, right?
Do I have to click/enter/fill anything here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, that is why I am writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euros return fee is a frivolity in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag be greeted me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of MBundestag you can see one thing: it is not extistent.
We got into a winter hibernation and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it all about?
For the most part, this may simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here, and how we generally look.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many here really still have bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, which has become aware of this project in recent days and has found a, to put it simply, pile of rubble.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we behave outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but that’s not a bad thing, we have the disagreement in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for this and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the ceiling #PRS_ORG#, are there also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the installation?
How long do I have time to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian life for a while, currently probably rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian for several years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also support animal cruelty.
That is why I decided to become a vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that on her side resentment arose, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knows where her meat comes from and you as a vegetarian reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my return on site.
Since I can’t be there for a funeral, that can’t be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly to be found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
The Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, recently handed over a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 grant note to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein City Hall for the new water rescue vehicle for the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving staff, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein you can count on permanently increasing operations: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I’m a bit frustrated because the whole thing has cost me a lot of time and now I’m hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for posing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to comment on this!
The question of the right and the left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in the special uniform and coat of arms, people to the right of conservative magic should not be attuned to it, nor should it be obvious to anyone that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality less clearly, because you have, of course, besides the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and even homosexuals (and by that I do not mean these men are now more likely to have to do so).
But these marginal groups also represent, even if it sounds strange to my experience after a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left politics, even if this policy supposedly supports them or thinks it is necessary to make them right, they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the rights, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that threaten the state is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign service often start to standardize due to negative experiences and even sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certainly also right-wing comrades who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that’s so good in my opinion that we couldn’t afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
It was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I’ve previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More proper by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been working on one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am independent, very little free time), but even during my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it picks me up and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really “that someone could come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, although it bothers me somewhere but most of the time, household simply loses to work and dislike.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet, but I've been working on it for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and e.g. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformation with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting anew and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-assured (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ADHD).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I do not know if the concrete workday is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something less to complain about my code ("already the simplest things are spoiled") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know how to do it" / "I really keep him from working" etc.
The problems I will probably have in any profession but I wanted to have it mentioned in the place.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean, give it back?
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed is broken down by the bird into the individual proteins (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and from these, in turn, builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the mowing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as there may otherwise be disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin intake with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One coated measuring spoon (inserted) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is sufficient until the re-formation of the plumage is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be felled.
So a case application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus also walnuts is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I think so, the only question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just contemplating everything that can be contemplating.
Before I get out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a beginner.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t mention anything more specific here).
But then I was too bored and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the teaching office and I was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now, I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I’m completely drained.
Now it’s a holiday, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the reef I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend and my holiday evening my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in those moments.
Now the family celebration itself is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that further annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref runs well as far as the feedback is concerned and so on.
But I’m completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take some time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but it was not properly paid for and worked me in a team what is now.
But then I wonder if in a year I have not returned to the same place as now and I am dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of crazy, but maybe as an outsider, you've got advice or ideas coming out of this situation that I'm completely done with, and I kind of start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and excuse the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become clear at least a little bit.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly mimics the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only bubble.
With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you’ve always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity can be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stop as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the terminal stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, each VT+ amplifier’s Valve Reactor circuit perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but to win against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104-106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro parts, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
One possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-alien things.
With the Everyday Backpack 20L, drone pilots also make an optimal choice, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," island council president Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava that was several meters thick.
That’s nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landing tongues with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
In particular, banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was severely affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner, and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be revived in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christchild
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were presented in one way or another.
The background of this still-popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Nikolaus the Christchild and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gifting thus shifted to the Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only annoys the few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martins custom with Martinssingen and Martinszug.
Today you can find everything in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyful cuddling about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christ child appears on Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, which is basically a kind of Nicholas, to which over time some peculiarities have been assigned.
This includes, for example, his white barb of noise, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian barb of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fabulous creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the handing over of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man carrying a gun to a bank and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is easy to install and can be anchored with 2 earth spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used all year round in the outdoor area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow in color.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in the same six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic roundings fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He is also doing well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of pre-work: As a solar lamp, »Smart Stone<0xC2><0xAB> does not require a supply line or batteries.
Place the “lighting stone” in any place that is lit by the sun during the day.
Two supplied earth spikes ensure a firm hold when needed.
The matt-white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides “Smart Stone” inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of a break-in at dusk, »Smart Stone<0xC2><0xAB> automatically starts to shine; in which color, you decide for yourself: six attractive light colors are your choice – next to daylight white.
The power-off is finally automatic as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I’ve done this several times and it doesn’t work.

Pill problem
Hello dear ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again, because I have to take enough drugs due to chronic diseases, which I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
On my last roughly two-year break, I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive spikes and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it has burdened me quite nicely and I did not feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and non-ged<0xC3><0xB6>ns is my cosmetics already, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the lovely skin is such a thing.
Had pre-buperpert<0xC3><0xA4>r bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-area lumpy spots and the acne theme.
I also tried everything I could in the course of chronic illness and I hung on to sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that hormonal is just the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop looking for something else that is still wrong.
I already had everything her colleague Semina o. <0xC3><0xA4>.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and then suddenly everything was gone...

110 kV earth cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The planning decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction, which is expected to begin in 2022.
This was reported by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometer long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a freeway mast near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment
Thank you for the message
Why only $20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, so yes the request at #PRS_ORG#, since it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently still have big problems time-efficiently planning my teaching in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geologists).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and I actually stand by myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
And so do the worksheets.
Maybe I can get an earth science teacher to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to finish the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation on the Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed to do so.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains about sales declines.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the trade association Germany (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
When dealing with items of non-daily need, sales declines are to be lamented, criticized HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It works well only in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
“2G shopping is not going to get us in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The tape regulation had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked on 2G (vaccinated or cured) once and would have access to all shops with the received tape on that day.
In addition, in retail - as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at well 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economics Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the Center will try to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, at a central point in the center once provide their 2G proof and after that - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that was tried to be masked with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already wrapped and glued it back into the package.
How do I proceed with the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The colour temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted by a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle that allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work on either the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, one of the storage keys is simply occupied and finished by pressing for a longer period of time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that in the case of new switches, the known situation is restored - very practical in the studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply power to the headlamp via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination can be adjusted reliably by means of latches on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a bow joint is included in the delivery.
It is great that there is also a bag included in the scope of delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates a bold comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two series-winning Hesse were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga match.
But then the SGE turned up, fired within a good hour the frustration of a full season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "pauseal-praise, to everyone who was there".
Initially, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, now in ninth place, still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen 2-0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly great,” the 27-year-old said, looking forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself in a good position regarding the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now you want to "go on step by step and remain humble" and "go through the tasks until the change of year at this level".
Next, an away game at Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach (18.30 a.m., Sky) will be on the schedule as early as Wednesday during the English week.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it rerouted, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and re-order?
Unfortunately, I would say that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women sneeze after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty glances from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at the 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers suffered a landslide defeat and must now run in the quarterfinals against host Spain.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said German coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game for everyone, which we have to delete,” said Captain Emily B<0xC3><0xB6>lk.
In the fight for entry to the semi-finals against the 2019 World Cup second on Tuesday, a significant increase must be made to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," conceded backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look ahead now quickly."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the mark.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 setback after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the intended initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game was run at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarter-finals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and at least five goals until the break.
The silent hope of a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer catch up to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

The title suggests that I work as an inoculant in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, some of them will continue in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as these are not related to a personal one (e.g. "I take medication X, it is compatible with vaccination ..").
In my area of responsibility is the explanation for the vaccination, the indication position (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the corona vaccination order and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, which, however, cannot (should not) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, in the BR television broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been provided for intense reflection.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who "must all go quickly".
This, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably surprised many Upper Palatines.
"The skinner," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian Television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived in some way from the more well-known word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also with some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire selection in the race bike - really so safe?
This morning I woke up full of action, because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare for my bike tour in the coming week.
Said, done and I rode my bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what is waiting in each city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud squealing and my rear tire definitely didn’t want to go the rest of the way.
Due to the weekday I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and replacement hose, I had to turn around with half bad mood and take the first best track home.
Wasn't that bad in terms of fun, maybe it's better if I practice this with the tyre change before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch ahead of me over several days, I would get this problem extremely unnervingly more often.
Now it was really not bad, since even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike took off until 14:00 120km!) and who had already described this as suboptimal, because he has been on the roll with them for several years.
But if I think that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I had a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be instable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> / tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have at the moment on the racing bike I think 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me about other tires on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to my absolute! Do you prefer to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and kind regards!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would be re-launched.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new sprayer and is visually reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a suitably designed foot is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved sonically.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate almost unfiltered sound pressure levels of this size.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight pitch increase.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the greatly increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly outwardly rotated, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that seeks its own.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer once again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate in the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of an upper cutter, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these are now glued the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued together.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if required, if you want to use, for example, finished strips from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated by means of a suitable hole-circuit saw or a forstner drill.
A round cutter is then used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded with this.
Subsequently, the base plate is glued firmly to the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2,5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (aspirate / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In this case, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and it is also left hanging out there loosely.
Subsequently, the frequency deviation is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switches, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in place with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
"Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per turn, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get ready for a cold drink, plan a good meal and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
