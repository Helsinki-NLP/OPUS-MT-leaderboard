We are working very hard in the field today.
Let's get the bus out of town.
We've had to re-paint the blade to add a new color.

We have a small house.
We need to stand up to the injustice.
Your life in the world!
Your life in the world!
Welcome to.
Welcome to the country.
Welcome to the country.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
It's good you did!
It's good you did!
We went there when we were in the French countryside.
We're all students, we're all students.
It's a combination of the two of us.

"Did you love that boat?" "No."
Did you have a lot in the house?
Did you have a lot in the house?

Why did you say you wanted me to learn French?
Why didn't you listen to me?
Why do people go to the house?

Do you want to go to the French class?
Will you be there?
Do you want to work in the office in the morning?
"Do you drink wine?" he asked.
Don't you want to give me more milk?
"Are you going to go down the wrong path?" he asked.
Do you put the milk in the milk?
"Did you see the movie last night?" or "No."
"Do you see the house again?" he asked.
Do you take that?
Aren't you going to the house?
"Can't you see that I'm right?"
Isn't that what Thomas did?
Do you want to get married to Mary?
"Do you want to go to Australia?" "I'm sure you will."

You are the love of my life.
You don't need you.
You're better than the law.
It's your life.
My sister can't talk to you today.
You shouldn't go out.
"You have a lot of French." "I'm not so fond of you."
He's right you.
I didn't invite you.
