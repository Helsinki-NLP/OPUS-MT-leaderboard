I'll wait here until he comes back.
The teacher teaches.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can buy a dog at the store.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It is simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They don't help.
Please contact me as soon as you get to Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later we will all die.
How long will it take?
It is a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn’t go on.
Probably not.
I want that too!
She looks but sees nothing.
You can’t eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I would like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I didn't.
Any universe that is simple enough to be understood is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn’t have to hurry.
Oh, please?
No matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Get up and get in your car.
Bring her a plate of salad.
We are war.
She didn't answer.
I've heard that Mary wants a divorce.
Is it a hedgehog or a chameleon?
Tomorrow my father is coming home.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never lose hope.
Can you give me some salt?
This book belongs to the library.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
When I was in high school, I got up every morning at 6 a.m.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Obviously, you’ve done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
You're to blame.
She rejected my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what will happen in the future.
We made cookies in the form of squirrels.
Everyone likes dolls.
What did you do to deserve this?
Take a look at the example above.
Her smirk looked very funny.
I wanted to become a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come on the 9th?
Why are you calling?
They discussed the problem.
If I had not received his help, I would have been dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here right now?
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence to that on the board.
She greeted him happily.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he speaks.
I don't know what's happening to me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don’t expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he was saying.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't it a wonderful morning?
At least it's a story.
I have more and more gray hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm a sleeper.
The sky is blue.
The old woman collapsed and could not get up.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
You can use my dictionary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
Tom likes you.
He rarely stays at home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom began to call for help.
His son is eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me that he would be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy a pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't leave now. We're getting ready for lunch.
Italy is a beautiful country.
It's an old fool.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas does not speak English.
The school is five miles from my house.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
Slitting on the floor in Singapore is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of roses filled the room.
Sometimes the bad wins.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're to blame.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Who's there?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a snake.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't, let's go.
What's going on with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry now.
I'm going to France for my vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You are an engineer.
The door slowly opened.
At least it's a story.
Are you into any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please, just get out.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you will see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don’t know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are grey.
I still remember the days when we made a stand with you.
When we go to sleep, we say good night.
The scandal has ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know that you know that I know.
Go home before six o'clock.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don’t want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The lights lit up the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
A woman eats bread.
I eat an apple.
A lonely person gets pleasure from watching the turtles.
Who is that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps were speeding up.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you enter the classroom.
They don’t do anything else but complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me as soon as you get to Boston.
Tom got up at 7:00.
This one's for us.
Listen to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How's it going?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn’t stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everyone knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tom's gone.
I can't.
Get out of the class.
Three dogs are sleeping on my mother's lap.
Thomas had already finished the work he needed to do.
If you can’t have children, you can always adopt.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still couldn’t get on the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up as a gift?
Do you like to live like this?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don’t you really have a home?
Do you play chess?
Her boyfriend is a Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many breweries in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
The parents expected too much from their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He entered my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don’t have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students love the English language.
The test was so difficult that we didn’t have enough time to complete it.
That's it.
You have to work fast.
If you believe that society has not created anything of value, then you can say that you believe in mass destruction.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were pointless.
Where's the mirror?
This girl sings very well.
Life is unfair.
Each person has paid a thousand dollars.
Jill is the only girl in our club.
Students do not have to go to school today.
The sun is gone from the cloud.
His parents were happy with his success.
Now it is our home.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
It helped to fix my clock.
No one's worth helping you.
John doesn’t know what to do next.
He suffered from a severe headache.
I want a dog.
I have to find my pen.
Nigeria was once a British colony.
Do not throw stones at the river.
I teach German well.
She paints her room white.
I can't go until he comes.
I invited her to dance.
Have you already done your homework?
John is a professor of French literature at the University of Oxford.
Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your clock's ten minutes late.
They cheated on you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm Irish.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.
He did not pay the debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone, except for her, smiled.
The Queen stood before the King.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She is my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Thomas looks different.
What is the cost of renting a room?
We have to get out of here.
Tom never wants to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They do not pose a threat.
Her advice encouraged me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does this tour visit?
It started to rain heavily, which is why we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look just adorable tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom dressed up.
The oven is hot, so be careful not to overheat.
Did you find your letters?
For the love of God!
I don’t know if the room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I didn't know how to get up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He will do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
The tree grows at her house.
Do not speak in the reading room.
How are you, ma'am?
I changed the yen to dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom's going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you curse them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious. It's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This climb is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why doesn’t anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally translated it.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I never want to be indebted to anyone.
Look at the train running across the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm fifty-five.
Her smirk looked funny.
Don't touch her. She's too young to understand that.
I bought this dress just for this occasion.
It's similar.
Be careful, okay?
That is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
Don't you know the way?
I like it very much.
Tom will need help.
I've printed a hundred pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget your ticket.
Raise your hand before answering.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.
The war ended their investigation.
When spring comes, the days become longer day by day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I had to come earlier.
He only eats what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He lost his ticket to the cinema.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
By the way, what's your address?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants.
What I always said.
He heard her cry at midnight.
Please bring me a glass of water.
He grabbed her hand.
Eat the bread!
If God did not exist, we would have to create Him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very welcoming.
You don't understand.
She has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Tom have any experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You must go there.
What's the reason?
I don't see anything from here.
Since I didn’t get an answer, I wrote to her again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I had a beer and was very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her walk into the park.
You don't seem to be busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bicycle.
It is low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was exhausting.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn’t seem interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog is trying to escape.
Like I said, I won't do anything.
After that, there is a small brown puppy on the table.
Stop them.
Anna really likes chocolate.
I know Mike likes basketball.
I have to cut the whole bucket of apple jam.
He died of old age two years ago.
Bring the chair to your room.
The taxi quickly turned to the left.
Yes, I understand, thank you.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
He was accused of murder.
If you don't go to school, you won't learn anything.
If anything happens, call me right away.
Would you like to eat baked potatoes?
Is there any danger?
It's dangerous for you to swim in this river.
My friends are wonderful.
Gold won't buy everything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please, open this box.
Is it a healthy fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what kind of music she liked.
There are no event mourners.
Is she happy?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She disappeared without a doc.
I'm here a lot.
She continued her speech.
Mike can't play baseball well.
Carrots are often used when traveling in the desert.
Mary is a bookworm.
Have a good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting your time and go back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
To want to be happy is normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
Yesterday my hand hurt.
If I'd been rich, I'd have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father doesn’t eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and wished me a good night.
My friend is here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn a language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that really true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
That's half nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make him a photo robot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Tom's never gonna let you down.
I was in Canada then.
I made this food myself.
Write a pencil.
Someone wrote his name on the wall.
Anything that can go in the wrong direction will go in the wrong direction.
They no longer have sugar.
I love your daughter.
Tom is hoping he won't eat the leftovers again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought I was very tired.
I don't think she wants to eat anymore.
You're either with us or against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Tom knows that he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's scared of the dog.
He went to the store, but stopped at her house.
The snow is falling fast.
We're having lunch here.
Of course, I should read this book.
Tom is currently not in prison.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship disappeared over the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Maria had a problem with her lungs.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did you buy?
The child cried all night.
Can you see me?
She testified against him.
My father grows rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I went in through the window.
The meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Have you heard anything?
Is she your mother?
Can you turn on the light?
He no longer trusts the doctor.
This was the first time I visited the museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom will want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat that green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but didn’t see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The Swedish capital is Stockholm.
They talked about love.
Tom never wants to do it again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror in there.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please keep going.
He was busy.
I am a widow.
I saw him.
I'll teach Lo<0xC5><0xBE>bana.
"Good morning," said Tom, smiling.
I hurt my hand.
He needs a ladder.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in a week.
You have to pave the way for your own life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He slid and almost collapsed.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do this every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I take back everything I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I came in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He promptly wrote down our names.
My son died during the war.
He is unhappy with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> We may as well all go <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
Who is sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They go shopping.
Everything that is genius is simple.
The students are learning too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Get your shoes on. Let's go to lunch.
The birds flew to the south.
This tea is very delicious.
I don't agree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He is very proud of his toy.
That's enough for us.
I'm not afraid at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a postman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of chalk.
Let me do it.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let in the fresh air.
Have you ever offered a saga?
Hardly snowy.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn’t want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she is doing?
He came here before the class was over.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was lying on my pillow and didn’t want to get down.
There are several good hotels in the city.
Why this letter?
He doesn’t want to study today.
We are all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
This is great.
It’s not a method, it’s a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water here is very shallow.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell off the ladder.
He can interrogate people.
Bob was washing dishes at the time.
My brother is two years older than me, but he is three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What is your home address?
Tomorrow he will be free.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom's gonna die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with the red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are basketball players.
These clothes are right for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know that you are stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can’t leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to return home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw someone waiting for her at school.
You don't seem to be busy.
Where's Maria?
A new contract allows us to demand anything we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call each one later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
It's a lot of fun!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city center.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very loving man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very nice man.
I have been to Boston several times.
You're a very nice man.
