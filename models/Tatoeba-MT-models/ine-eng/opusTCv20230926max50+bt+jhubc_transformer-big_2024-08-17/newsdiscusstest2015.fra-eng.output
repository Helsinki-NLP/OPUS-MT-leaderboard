UKIP residents who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You’re talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn’t be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who uses special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing crazies, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a torch is not evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage’s sentence came as a surprise, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You will need to be able to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media is talking about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
In the end, the situation is just as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have settled anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the ''Tiger of Europe'' we were bragging about a few years ago.
We've seen the sequel!
It starts again by reading the article.
We are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing ''pavoiser'' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is on in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on companies.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France from the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If one believes a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and cheap) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily closures since the return.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon catch on.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hang on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it won’t be on one of those two once they’ve been blasted.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay a surcharge for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them with?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy about it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare have only to take care of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport's air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS into Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally teeming with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% tourists.
@Aloes is wrong.
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in a tax-free way.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
Remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allow to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're looping it.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the biblio municipale is open 4 days a week but not we!
This is access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended tenaciously against fascism
the way of life he defended tenaciously against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter’s estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Me neither.
But for 5 years, and only for 5 years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other aristocrats of the government who wanted to discuss an “agreement” with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill at the helm for these five years, just these five years, and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure projects by definition being less renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real French mistrust of dialogue.
Return to the Princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives income from his property.
It is necessary to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his annuities.
A property to rent or even two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of great infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild, therefore brutal, decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or opportunities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then the need for investments is crying: insulation, railway network renovation, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high incomes and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a galloper.
Samsung’s profits are hurt by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-SeptemberTM introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have captivated buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not in favor of Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile phone industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our interest to all.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian fools) could tell us what author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultured.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this topic does not interest me, and honestly I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my arrears, because I am slow but I understand well...
@Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how intimately these studies affect them.
We are no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: When it comes to an idea debate, I thought it was best to go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the only exposition that their detractors make of them (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really envelop the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
It bothers you, doesn't it?
I was in Melbourne then of course I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the Perseid meteor shower week and for virtually all of the major astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds above the Melbourne suburb.
I'm going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
ANYONE watching this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last before you go to bed.
Who or what is going to get you when you are gone?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for posts in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between incomes of labor and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that one can make an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15 the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
However, these are the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are not substantiated.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit of the notary’s courageous attack have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL....
The state is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that guarantee the growth of tomorrow and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors do not make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and “research.”
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or just on prescription.
This reinforces it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite laws that curb them and costly permits needed.
While manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who arrive at a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you ma'am but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of an official of this hospital.
We can't have patents on the grass.
If “researchers” in the social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, one could possibly use their “works”.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
To compare is not to seek.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
One cannot say “the search is over, it must be applied” and then in the same jet “it is necessary to experiment with everything”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can you explain to me how a “researcher” can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory for us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what is right for you, a will to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to distance sophists and ideologues from training, and that practitioners teach practitioners.
Reread the paragraph on the internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads first of all to the reproduction of the current practices, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, one cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Educational theorists must have no place.
Practitioners should have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
To give more weight to the theorists of education would destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally unfair: if I do not want to be operated on by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would still less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement, I’ll just have to read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = vol.
This is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive artists of their breadwinners.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't come true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what a reasonable use should be, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have passed with a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we are full of, the rumour that everything is going wrong....
If it's a PS MP who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are the age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are the speeches like yours.
@gus I have been working in a private company ever since.
I have had the opportunity to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red bullets at the null bosses that I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small companies - What are the French bosses waiting for to do so?
Let the state hold their hand.
This state they accuse of empire?
by Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couple on your part!
Remember me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are booming and waning while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers’ charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given how people still complain about First Group.
From what I see where I’m from, Last wasn’t really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That's not to say that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don’t have the power to do that.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
Well, Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing stopping people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally overturned.
And better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that the workers must all help each other across borders.
We can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Maybe it's because the Dutch are on the right track and the British aren't.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a beating girl.”
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaters", who are no less dead, I know palpated.
Getting out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I’m not saying it’s the condition to manage, I’m saying it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Tired of thinking otherwise, if, having a solid morale probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is above all someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "Lord" it is something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirty, big ones, and if I "battled" as these psychological purposes say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about clenching your teeth, suffering hell, and taking the punches.
I believed that the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE LOWEST rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of this: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was quickly recognized by Western states that then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of earthquake prediction in Greece that works roughly, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to feature detectable water molecules," according to a study by Dra.
A method to follow.
As well as those involving animals feeling a threat to arrive.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for often delighting us with these experimental feats that are realized in the world.
How will the animals know (in advance)?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Take radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the instruments of measurement available to him.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the struggle of two scientific teams, one from California and the other from Japan, to make known the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly on their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me.
Or are we talking about this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should re-learn to listen to nature.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we run into the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake, the red fish turned bizarrely round.
I don't understand why we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected mayor and he didn’t keep one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because it is popular.
Because it's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been inculcated into celebrity worship.
The Londoners voted for him and the same will be true for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the lead of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will crack the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I’m not so sure: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we used to say about the Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the Parpaing with him, smarter than he was.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “Storm Strait” speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the »Iron Bottom Sound<0xC2><0xAB>.
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total fumigation.
Calculate the kerozene consumed to achieve the objective totally decredifies the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
An operation of com more neither does nor does.
The cow is so envious!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recitation makes me see, identifying me a little in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest row!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I do not know if they are still in the team
It's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was mid-field or before in the 70s and 80s and has coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and played as a striker in Velez's great team which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also featured such greats as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful Wel<0xC3><0xA8>ne Ar's teammate).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not a licensee.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little bit of nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to the neighboring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" when two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How ???
What bothers me a little in this "witnessing", is that the only fact that I could, even once, spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a "border line" personality, all of which "witnesses" should be taken with the utmost circumspection.
Undoubtedly, in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought about the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do really and apocalyptically wrong to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
The grandiose.
It would seem that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims who are gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
Testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We doubted it a little.
The "Christian/White/Gaul" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the mususman when he contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendour, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons are irrigating the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freeze of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
As we have seen before, Muslims should not be pushed back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in the fall.
Not as breathtaking as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your grunt who radates clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs from outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrile climax with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and lots of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child benefits , it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from the deciles 8 to 10 .
However , in terms of the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of the half-part concerning especially widows is not at all addressed in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And he's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the straw, of course, but thinkers
For once the PS makes a policy rather left we are not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let’s keep it that way and you’ll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and OCI recycled at the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from hoarding as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is no longer used only to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are one of the richest 20%.
Without a doubt also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which a part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or as much lower arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing .
The utopias of the red Khmer headscarves have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the front desk or face any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone’s house, sleep there, put them behind you and leave.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you’ll need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, that’s not true.
You just really missed out on luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article cite Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Supporting the troops,” sang the Bu$herie on all tones...
Inoffensive weapons.
I am sure that this will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who have died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're in agreement.
Do you think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if “they” were made to work 35 hours instead of 17.
Right now, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing for their program.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework, in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
By the way, it is so much the board at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation that we can not fill the CAPES of maths, come, we are waiting for you.
How come you don't want to be smothered by the ill-educated charlatans whose parents spit on you and treat you like a swindler?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurd population can flourish better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job that needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad for being a London Underground worker, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, do not worry if you do not find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well, or you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan.
I don’t like working in a company so I hope to eventually move either into the public service or into the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This post is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of sleazy fields like art/letters/theatre/media/philosophy/political science, that is to say what we call unemployed diplomas.
I have one of these degrees and I have finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting salary was lower but we quickly go up the ladder because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate about engineering studies/artistic disciplines has been going on for years.
Scientists can not solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people so as to get results.
Are letters, philosophy and art a gift to each other?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about media studies or whatever the absconding field you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and put them to the test.
Wouldn’t it be better for a real territorial policy to unburden Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise end-of-slope doing 80km round-trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner walls and the small belt already have many means of public transport that are otherwise more convenient (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key-closed parks, such as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Much benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for ONE bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delano<0xC3><0xAB>....
Well, it's not right at all.
When we talk to pedestrians and other users of public transport about the reasons why they do not pedal on the road, it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and do not care about the survival of the bikes 2 / we take full control of the traffic.
The cycle paths are apartheid, we need to live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV is right.
The 15% goal of cycling is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens into flour.
Moreover, from what OR reports, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
Not sure how to love the way the world is changing.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority in charge of the security of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching airstrikes against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay overflight fees to the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government / the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in bulk that Putin shot down Flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 International Court of Justice ruling that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this matter go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think Abbott means to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to back up his allegations.
So far, investigators have not said anything like this.
To be called Ricardo and to be such an eco-beautiful bee, it's distressing!
To be called Polar is to lose the north is to be joyful.
There is only one question: is the poor man of today poorer than the poor man of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who criticize Piketty’s book most virulently haven’t read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labor income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the early 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after 1914.
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, one can debate it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue in a single sense in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paper summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this that seems to me pure fumigation.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity been enriched in general?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the award.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighbourhoods of Britain!
Someone thought that his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favor of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide for herself of her marriage.
However, this is someone unusual in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having her say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry on the subject of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of a hard time finding her soy character of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have it all at once than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is especially the risks of staging and editing that appealed to me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the aseptication of today's productions.
I'm a little short of seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things still.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is truly ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end up like 24 hours of chronos what.
Everyone does what they want, right?
That’s why I say “I won’t look at it again” and everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But then, here's my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - coupons rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to saber in spending failed.
Controversy about relatively small spending positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their wishes and during all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
The "debt" is that of assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, almost useless wind turbine subsidies and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you get to a figure that makes the residences look like a lot of money.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 per year will pay around <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 will pay around <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and that's before the VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for a door-to-door job prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed are not looking, it means that 80% are looking and can’t find.
As an unemployed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of that.
In fact, I haven't heard from Job Center in months, does that mean that agents are more busy checking operations than really getting job ads in?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you need to get rid of Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed do their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their title of transport to users of a means of transport, a service chief or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have had to deal with P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
The filing and control is taking over at the moment, while Statutory Employment Pole is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, it is they who pay the contributions.
Politicians and non-wage Frenchmen are giving themselves rights they don’t actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the valorisation of wage labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS from reaching this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hajj in Mecca this year for Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent trips.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world has the same spirit.
Is it heartless to offer to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was common sense but apparently those “who know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed under strict quarantine.
No one's coming out.
Only health care workers can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa despite having taken “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
That he succeeds in conveying the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the totality of the functioning cortexes of the planet.
It’s still a long way from that concept.
It has only been 20 years since information emerged as the given premium of humanity, while religion, derived from the brain, directs our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely in the minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it pre-existed to Christ.
A century before, Hillel had already said to him: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "promoting justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset the moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new game Elite will be out soon.
It doesn't make it up.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If it’s the PC version you’re interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'm gonna go check it out.
Obviously not at work.
The IT department's joysticks block all nice sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Note, however, that the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is void.
It's time to buy a new video card *makes the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid one day they'd wipe it out of your library if they decided to lash out at the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
Thus, France of 1940 was a "putrid land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, one does not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
You will appreciate mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, keep dating Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the terrible ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I’ve been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.

That being said, without wanting to bother you, I think you are moving away from the subject a bit.

Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the authorities, organizations or associations representative, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who does not say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval of the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the delitization of French society.
If there is no doubt, say so.
Who does not say consent, but consent to what?
Agree to a closeness with ISIS or to the condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't have a seat.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “Promise” thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are demanding accountability from their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important than that.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing the pumps from 8% to 85% is not a super election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on issues that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists, and she did it well.
Yet he is still running for prime minister in 2015 and has been since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and all the way to the end.

There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of acid-sucking schizophrenic kids.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it’s actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending there a serious warning of retaliation or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Indian Punchline’s reading is to be strongly recommended to anyone paying attention to details rather than the c*nneries balanced by traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read keeping in mind the previous realistic observations/warnings coming from Iran around 1979 – Afghanistan.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world towards the abyss and I would suggest that those referring to non-existent “moderates” pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be required for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we “should”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend...
Wouldn’t criminals just be old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal were killed just after the First World War in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a poor spot in Central Asia about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding an empress there.

I don’t know why there are so many derogatory comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they’re posted by people who’ve never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of stories that truly reflect the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can keep an ear out if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will once again pass soul vinyls, including full Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.

The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard ...
That it displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...

In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.

Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a relationship of strength!
Do you doubt it?! ...
Plus, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Much of what he says is just pseudo-Chomskyist gimmicks written by no one else.
That proves you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, maybe truths we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloid he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms and instead to vote politically that they should not vote at all - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) is necessary to do so.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that to be politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are puppets who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is furious to see all these condescending answers that do not matter.
His solution is extremely debatable and it would be nice if people would debate what he really says rather than simply label him as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about voting has been completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot paper into an ballot box every five years annoys me deeply because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their voters.
Furthermore, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand’s remarks are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group together under the label of “pseudo-Chomsky bullies.”
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do as Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a porch, with even the nods added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “thread” reveals to me above all that the intellectual debate has not for a long time been held at the RDV of History where trade historians have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of ready-to-think condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a guilty person, a scapegoat.
They develop one and the other of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats who are the key vault of their thinking.
I believe rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the relation to the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchistic, neo-lib and/or libertarian slope (both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing going to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt he does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals cited here.
No support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god of the time, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet gives a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or disagree with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can't stand the passing of allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add to me seems to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of the whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them hold violently anti-White sayings.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians especially have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of Australians about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), I haven't kept bad memories of them, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London have been very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don’t remember who you meet, all the people are worth each other, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always come out with that white one.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly right.
As for the Judiciary Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made on the basis of the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the mandatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to distinguish between error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretense and ignorance are not the subject of objective analysis.
And so if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to enter the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary*.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* that is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The domain in question is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed up to the means of fraud to the procedure* by hereditary genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession gets a good year bad year 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the almost-impunity judicial* of the French notariat.
For an understanding of their mechanism, some of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to become thus sloppy, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lying?
Totally prohibitive pricing.
More equipment to scam disabled people.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires bulky, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean a dog's dung on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price on a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems to me particularly useful.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know we need.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, it is not planned to manufacture it.
I am content that the long-distance wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this broken thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes have been destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza in heavy shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation too, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all Gazan civilians.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh that's not the language of wood, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
The anti-Zionist...
Good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and recognized.
Two million people have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The U.S. has a well-maintained territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Also remember that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Bloc is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the back of the population who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've given it some thought.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and process it directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What does she rent out?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The word “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in real honesty, c'est bonnement) on Airbnb...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The rigs are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our peniches...
Where are you going to tie it?
Marine Le Pen is right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts.
Poverty is on the rise in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be called!
Capitalism will not be impoverished.
High finance, speculum, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food so our food, with the structures of care so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this in favor of some hyper-mega-obese money.
To prove otherwise, FH said, "my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Economy Minister a former Rothschild banker, a history of better defending the interests of the banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else out there competing?
What do you call it: turning back his jacket, lowering his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was scorching at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if that was still the case at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battlecruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped firing, and a chase began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached he saw that it was only a wreck.
N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg, slower than other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, lean and badly damaged but still in motion.
After pointing its headlights at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged the Good Hope to have escaped and halted the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried about reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, experimenting in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they scrambled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several votes are raised at the UMP to ask that it be inscribed in the law that an elected person definitively convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives of the left of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED AN REGISTRATION TO THE WALL OF THE MAGISTRATE CONS
When is the prohibition of trade unions in the protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to tame those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway at around noon with their little banners "for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if unions of the right, or even of the extreme right, targeted the personalities on its side and waged a juridical-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right spends the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed the facts that fall under it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the focus of his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that the left-wing trade union of the judiciary is not the only trade union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
One now wonders whether the "mission" of some judges is no more dirty than instructing.
@Gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to impeach and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most glory-hungry fool realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the judges.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television’s light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But this is what happens anyway to most of the stars who do not participate in the contests.
Rarely are those who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
In any case, most singers/bands can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar shakers who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three chords on a primary school-level poem will surely become stars and the only question is how many albums they want to hit.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us with these distant people as infinitely superstitious and riddled with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to everyday practices.
Except that you interpret recklessly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than say that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Moli<0xC3><0xA8>res do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever.
It's from the ephemeral deco to furnish the emptiness.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw at the nettles not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of the disciplines to make us laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your disdain for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before that archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have such high-performance technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book “The shamans of prehistory”, especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article.
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could go.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the ditch?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn’t watch a musical on that, but it would be too gay!
We could expect to get that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than making fun of these childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go on then.
If these childish “ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Video amateur crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. breaker) was entering the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV rights, pubs, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Of course, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English who was leading then...
You are leaving on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to dig up all your shit.
No, I just don't.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in mortal danger for a far-fetched story of one driver's chance of winning at the expense of another.
It’s not the FOM that brings out the safety because it’s the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In the light of amateur images, the lack of image above all allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How does the Commissioner wave a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one clearly sees one of the commissioners waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The police station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism makes advertising sell.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that in the end it’s just for the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, the pub and the media are good for selling us things supposed to improve our sex life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can continue to control them.
“When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear that it should be ‘derailed,’ not ‘cough.’
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are mad that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much credit.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that nicely and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
That made me laugh.
It's depressing to me that the media is talking about most things with this upside down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without getting hysterical) so that the government can make us skirmish when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to have a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being from this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years .....
Completely useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only do the testimonies serve no purpose: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@traffic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking questions of patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her stepmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what do you base your research on?
On fantasies?
Do you put on the same level fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the canned word flattered by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psys.
Cyrulnik has given us the hit of “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has worked out a reliable measurement scale for us to quantify, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang out?
The only solution that comes to mind is pee-pee humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging out.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Are you still in Super Mario?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I’m looking forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a channel to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we've had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this series every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the esplanades mosque!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and sabotaged it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: “Praise be to God!”
To boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown young na<0xC3><0xAF>ves half-dressed, languishing on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not take photos of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone the Jewish faithful down, praying at the Wailing Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is right, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is by revolution.
Since the economy seems to be winding down, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given increasingly large salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of whining and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don’t fuck people up with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are the ones that make excellent returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link is likely to be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were trade unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself the safe haven of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
They still miss the union of married men, celibate women, married women, celibate men, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French properly, I'm a syndicate.
You've been warned, it's your fault.
For the defence of the categorical interests, protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster is assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for Ignorance Sybille I was alluding to the military and other officials, since this is the topic commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will be: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of companies."
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”. ????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some have been well-seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a win for the least-worst baker; no one ever said, “boom, here’s my fucking cake now, eat it and bow down to your master!”
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives out there has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can’t imagine doing that to myself.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a great entertainment and encourages us to try new things.
Looking forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year’s challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to part with, I don’t know how they were able to pick a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make me want to, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allocated.
There is also cancer that is watching, with solar wind blows.
Certainly, everything is going well for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “throw” ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancer”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man, they have the interest to allow us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and allows UVA and most UVB to pass through.
Do you know that you are not required to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a resident when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am used to melanoma, UVs only accelerate its development.
They don't provoke him.
As proof: not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
That is, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV rays are necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or switch it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if enough force is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication material.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be bent if a sufficient force is applied to it
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we can hardly see how it could return to it.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Most likely, it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want inexpensive products and it is surprising that industrialists produce in »industrial' We put forward super u but all the brands and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want them.
Food, on the other hand, is one of them.
Go without grudge, I kiss you
We call people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is total thought-reason disaggregation.
They are experts in gesturing, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffle farming, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and truffles so do not be surprised to meet often critics about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the écoles because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
It is so badly made that it vaguely resembles a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic ability.
That's art. That's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it’s so easy, why don’t you do it yourself?
There is still much to save: horseback riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty obliges us to say that France is reducing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
This is a bad move for the local authorities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctity?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gagging is certain.
Let all those who have little or enough sided with the military thing dare to come here, eyes in eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will get a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can be a little busy!
Well yes, the savings that everyone agrees to say that you have to do them, you have to see it somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the murder when it happens at home, poor darlings.
It should be done but especially that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with each closure of posts, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for the savings, of course.
It is bizarre, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not look forward to the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment are making the same bad joke.
It’s the depression of scrolling through her Facebook feed and seeing that 80% of her friends started their statuses with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
He will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes there that his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and to grit his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet.”
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling for it!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and unsurpassable genius that emanates from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
We, the citizens, therefore, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner that they have planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown away....
Windmills and solar farms are the Rond points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity through renewables to fight against CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
The electricity from the renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not answer to what I said and like all people on the right demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and ineffective means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count water vapor greenhouse gas with less effect than Co2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapor and a little in the water of rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments do not want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against some Pakistani players participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata Athletic taking 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now to football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The low cost launcher race is paid in cash.
Too bad about such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with a helium too cold.
So maybe we are not in a design defect, but implementation...
Unlike Arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate as many media outlets are looping back the only titles of articles - and many readers are only retaining those titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project while it is only a launcher problem.
