Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) are concerned about the possibility of "being perceived as embers"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM across the political spectrum is concerned that it may make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's AMs explained that their group is concerned about "resonances with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "unique", while "pwp" means "cock".
Party Plaid AM indicated that none of the group "was not satisfied" and has recommended alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to consider the name change, but added that the MWP closely resembled the Muppet, which means "ear".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to English in the Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, informed: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be adopted by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, which garnered widespread support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of AM, the Commission preferred "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM clearly suggests alternative options, but the fight for an agreement could provide a headache for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on amendments will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the laws on the structure of the system of committees and the disqualification of AM.
The final vote of the AM on what they will be called will be taken after the legislative acts have been discussed.
The Macedonians are going to vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised to resolve decades-long disagreements with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives an impression of the claims on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, one of the plebiscite’s opponents on the name change, said he was ignoring the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, object that the name change is simply a matter that must be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are ringing as the churches of Harlem fight for existence.
“As the old people I’ve talked to tell me, there used to be bars and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is no one, no one else."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People nowadays socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer a neighborhood of living rooms that people visit on a regular basis."
Speaking even to the churches, he worries that the money he receives from selling the property will end faster than the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be back to the starting point."
The churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties that will shelter people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the area.
"The majority of people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day is approaching when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who will enter these apartment properties will become members of these congregations."
Both churches were built by a white congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshiped God nearby.
The Black Church of St. Martin took over his blessings during the time of John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers at 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who had refused to accept blacks to take up the job.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the call game "about the calls of poor people".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "the treasure of culture" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Linds (Dionisio A. Lind), who moved to the larger call game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin’s did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around the church of St. Martin reflected a complex relationship between architects and builders, some of whom had been attracted to the work by temporal power, while others by the diocese of the episcopal church.
In July, the parish council, which consists of the temporal leaders, wrote to the diocese with concerns that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent to the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager at lobster fishing site
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday in California who was diving for lobsters and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, according to the news agency.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., near the town of Beacon's Beach on Encinitas Beach.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV San Diego that he and his friends had been in the niris for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy being called for help, and then the group turned to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a thrill for the captured lobster, but then he "understood that the boy was shouting "Cock me!
It's fucking me!"
All of his key bone had been torn off," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he reached the boy.
"I scream for everyone to drop the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammels.
The boy was taken by air to the Reidy (Rady) Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was found to be critical.
The species of shark that has been attacked is not known.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told reporters that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was acknowledged that it was not a species that was dangerous to humans.
Jailss added that the victim was injured in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to the town of Swami's Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation time and security purposes.
Jailss noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry
"Sainsbury's" goes on the attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universal store-style beauty products shelves rows and trained sellers.
As part of the significant contribution of the United Kingdom to the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion large beauty market, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion goods and home-made items are declining, 11 stores in the country will try out larger rows of beauty products, and, if all goes well in the coming year, there will be more.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use shelves that were previously dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offering in the field of beauty care to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space with brand zones, similar to, for example, those in "Boots" stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its "Boutique" decorative cosmetics line, in which most products will be vegan-friendly – which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, fragrance wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to small grocery shopping every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to invest more in order to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that retail outlets will become more and more like universal stores, as the chain of stores tries to fight the discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved the flow of goods and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with Boats was tried in the early 2000s, but the union ran out of money after a dispute over how to split the proceeds from drugstores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, Celesio, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Under this plan, Lloyds will complement the range with a wide range of exclusive skincare products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for consumers, we have changed the look of our beauty products' shelves and the impression they make.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now a fascinating destination on the road to beauty, a destination that challenges the shopping habits of the past."
Peter Johns 'full of rage' after Holly Willoughby gives up <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragon's Den" star Peter Jones "takes over the wrath" after TV host Holly Willoughby refused to make an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus all his attention on his "Marcers" and his new contracts
Viloubia does not have time to devote to their home outfits and accessories brand "True".
The pair's business was compared to the "Goop" brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, a 37-year-old broadcaster, used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragon's Den star Peter Jones in a rage as she left her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute — to focus all her attention on her new huge deals with Marks & Spencer and VIT.
According to the sources of information, Jones was "indignant" when a TV golden girl in a tight house during a meeting on Tuesday at the residence of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, the value of which is up to 1.5 million euros, are not in his favor.
The company was compared with the brand "Goop" of Guinea-Latvia, and, according to the suggestion, it will double the fortunes of Villaubia, which are estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Vilhoubia (37) used Instagram to announce that she was leaving "Truely", Jones took off from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
As the source of information tells us, ""True"" was one of Holly's main priorities.
This was to become her long-term future, to which the next decade would be devoted.
Her decision to leave surprised all the unprepared people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of M<0xC4><0x81>rlov there is a warehouse full of finished goods for sale."
Experts believe that the head of "This Morning", which is one of the most financially profitable stars, the departure can pay the company millions, because a lot of funds are invested in various products - from pillows and candles, to clothes and goods for the house, and even more delay it to the market.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-year-old mother of Willowbie and her husband, Den Baldwin, has maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Viloubia "True" was formed with Kep in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The pair spend the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin TV's producer company.
Vilhoubia must become the brand's M&S ambassador, and she will replace Ent McPartlin as ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business dealings!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He lamented the criticism he would receive from news companies about the comment that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has the president given up so much?
Trump said in his pictured "news dictator" voice.
"I'm not going anywhere!"
He noted that Kim has shown interest in meeting again after Trump acknowledged their initial meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "response" from the US to North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump was much more optimistic in his mother's speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, including the cessation of missile tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to make a president's impression, but instead of 10,000 people standing out there trying to get into this densely populated area, we have 200, look, here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia hit the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the state of national disaster was not announced, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international aid, so that is a known problem," said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children gathers groups to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute to the aid.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unfavourable to the badness of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been established in Aceh, they are rarely found along other shores.
Most likely, the death of the people was also affected by the fact that Palu did not detect the warning sirens about the tsunami, although the warning was in force.
Even in the most favourable times, moving between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had somewhere in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims, is now going to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new station.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia's ruined infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration and he expects a re-election next year.
In addition, Mr. Joko has to contend with the protracted problem of sectarian tension in Indonesia, where a majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: "Liverpool" player Daniel Starridge with the intention of restoring balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League by winning the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starig received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri, who was about 25 metres (30 yards) from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of himself and then moved the ball in the direction of the farthest gate post.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kep Arrizabalaga) on the jump and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get in the position to get to the ball and players like Shaks (Shaq) always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to get myself as much time as possible," Starr explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante (Kante) approaching, touched the ball, and, without much thought, spied."
At halftime, Chelsea were in the lead with 1:0 after the Belgian star Eden Hazard took the lead in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward threw the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> (Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>), before turning to the middle of the field and throwing as quickly as possible on the side of the Liverpool field.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>s fast-forwarded and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful fight between the players, allowing Azard to get into the zone.
Azard beat the defense in speed and finished the combination with his left foot in the farthest pole net, past Liverpool's Ellison Becker.
At 3 p.m. on Wednesday, at the stage of the Champions League, Stadio San Paolo will fight against Napoli in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea and Videoton will meet in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832 people
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the country's disaster agency announced early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high waves, the news conference was informed by a representative of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutohopo Purwo Nu).
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered by rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police suspect a 32-year-old man in custody of a woman
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called in people in the area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite every taxi driver, especially those who might have recorded something in their car's video recorders, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, according to the police, they are dealing with the information of the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He couldn’t say a word when he found out what had happened.
People are told that they will have hours until they are allowed to return.
When a policeman tells a man that the whole neighborhood is perceived as a crime scene, he was heard.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible!"
Two afternoons there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was parked right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC by September 30, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 at 247.
The Cromwell statue in parliament becomes the latest scandal of "rewriting history"
Its abandonment would be ethically justified in view of activities similar to the Taliban, which resulted in the destruction of so many monuments of English culture and religion by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would also become a target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out the stoning of the shrines during the English Civil Wars.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his ancestor, a century earlier, Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell shows his view of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a person that many believe is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Many of Cromwell’s — perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today — regarded him as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in his case, of course, was a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue as to whether this is indeed a perfectly accurate depiction of the subject.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognisable figure who represents one of the parties to the divorce at the time.
What she has achieved as Lord Protector is worth celebrating and commemorating."
A pig-murderer to the death of a farmer in China
According to local media, a pig in the market in the south-west of China attacked a farmer and killed him.
The man — only his last name Yuan — was found dead with a ruptured artery, all in one blood at a pig manure market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pigs are to be injected into a pig pen in Xining, China, on 30 May 2005 in the province of Qinghai.
It is reported that he and his cousin had come from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and found that the door of the pigs’ mane next door was open.
He told me that there was a large pig man with blood on his mouth in the pig pen.
According to the information of the court medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (<0x7E>249 kg) of heavy wasp had crept into the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother — only his last name Wu is mentioned, writes "Guiyang Evening News".
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at about 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him, nor to his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the wasps had been switched on to prevent its attacks on others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to the information, Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
While such cases are rare, other pig attacks in humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man receiving critical injuries.
Just 10 years ago, a 650-pound (<0x7E>295 kg) pig in Wales was holding a farmer at a tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba, CBC News, explained that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to invite, they are very curious ... they do not want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of Hurricane Rose will bring a vast and powerful case to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa, heading across the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico, will weaken.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring flooding in northern Mexico and the U.S. Southwest.
At five o'clock in the afternoon (after the North American Eastern Time), the Pink Wind reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure creek forms over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the east coast of the United States. Rose with tropical storm force approaching the Baja California peninsula, on Monday it will begin to move moisture mass deep from the tropics to the north of the U.S.
On Monday in the pink part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical moisture, interacting with the coming low-pressure deposits, will create a large area of heavy rainfall in the South-West in the next few days.
1–4 inches (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mudflows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Moisture deep in the tropics will be caused by rainfall, which in some places will reach 2-3 inches (<0x7E>5.1-7.6 cm) per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm) of rain is expected.
There are possible sudden floods with a rapid deterioration of the state due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to go to the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain gas.
Strong rains can turn canyons into fast rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local winds and sandstorms.
The low-pressure plume will bring the local strong stuff to part of the Southern California coastline as it approaches.
Rain gases are possible, which together will exceed half an inch (<0x7E>1,3 cm), and this can cause small mud flows and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Separate scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on a late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains will take over a wider area on a late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain on Tuesday will spread to the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and last throughout Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the temperature in the Arctic decreases, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes a dramatic change in temperature over a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Demoin (Des Moines), Iowa, varies by nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, will try to form and expand long-term summer heat.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, reaching temperatures of 80 and more degrees (after Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) in vast areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (after Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees after Celsius), which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that temperatures in the eastern part of the US will exceed averages in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched a hearing in the Breta Caveno case
More than 20 million people watched enthusiastically on six television channels on Thursday, as evidenced by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual assault in the late 1980s, who, as a woman, turned 80.
Meanwhile, political indiscretions continued, with broadcasters halting regular broadcasts to report the latest twist in Friday’s events: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s arranged arrangement for the FBI to investigate charges for weeks.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno had grabbed her in their drink and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Caveno fearlessly testified that he is absolutely sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people watched it all on Friday.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered the interest of the average viewer.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually comes up with problems, counting the people who are watching the happenings in the offices.
To get a better idea, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of viewers of the exclusion games or the "Oscar" ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Caveno's appointment, had the highest number of viewers, averaging 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
There was also a lot of interest after the hearing.
Fleix was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team had issued a statement that he would vote for Caveno, the senator was spotted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he, accompanied by a cheer of protestors, tried to reach the Judiciary Committee by elevator.
On CNN, he stood for several minutes with his eyes pierced, as if he were shaved.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "you own power while so many women are powerless."
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed he was informed that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters were broadcast live hours later, as the Committee on Legal Affairs was preparing to vote on the nomination of Caveno to the Senate.
However, Fleik claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would look at the charges against the candidates next week, which have been demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleik was partially persuaded to negotiate with his fellow Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After negotiations with the Corps and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
The choice of Fleika was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FIB to investigate the allegations levelled against Caveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of political games over Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and the destruction of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her Brexit plan for Britain's future relationship with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that there is a "tariff" to use in the EU.
You’re not alone, you’re not alone, you’re not alone, you’re in control.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said in a statement.
Officials released a video showing Sims clashing with Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After hearing from Simpson, the police informed him that he had confessed to the shooting.
According to the lawyer, he was given a $350,000 security deposit.
The medical team of the East Baton Rouge Parish court expert released a provisional conclusion on Friday, stating that the death was caused by a gunshot to the head that hit the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police’s refugee search operation group, the State Police Criminalistics Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation, which resulted in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement officers for their "honour and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (<0x7E>1.98 m) long striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "disturbed" and "shocked" by the death of Will Wade.
"That's what a person is always worried about," said Type.
The volcano spits ash across Mexico
The ash rising from the Pokatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Reduction Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed repeated beatings and tremors.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Hochimilco, are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital's volcano's activation since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash between pro-independence protesters and public order police, and when thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary since Catalonia’s polarising vote to secede.
A group of masked separation supporters, hampered by public order police, harassed them with eggs and smeared powder paint, forming dark dust clouds on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also disagreements later that day, and the police used steaks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, chanting: "Don't forget and don't forgive!", were engaged in a confrontation with pro-unity protesters, who chanted: "Long live Spain!"
As reported by local newspapers, fourteen people were provided with medical assistance during the protests due to minor injuries.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains under great strain.
Voters expressed their confidence in independence, although voter activity was low, and those who opposed secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan officials, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, and there were vicious clashes.
The independence-supporting groups had protested on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy at the fact that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
While parties that support Catalonia’s independence won a small but significant majority in last year’s regional elections, these parties have struggled to stay ahead this year, as several of the most well-known leaders have either emigrated or are not detained and waiting for a referendum.
The 42-year-old mechanic Hoans Puig, who filmed a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year until the court, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidateing the European elections is the best way to uncover the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Crash in Building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was hit several times against a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings reported that the gate and also the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that the machine was fired from the crossbow at the same time.
Menga blow allows "Livingston" with 1-0 win "Rangers"
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the victory of Livingston
The backed Livingston stunned the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Meng's blow proved decisive, as Gary Holt's team leveled the situation with the "Hibernian".
The team of Gerard did not win the guests this season, and next Sunday they have to meet the leader of the "Hearts", from which they fall behind by eight points.
Before that, the European League on Thursday "Rangers" hosted Vienna "Rapid".
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their series without losses in the division to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't felt the taste of defeat since replacing Kenyan Miller (Kenny Miller) last month.
"Livingston" does not take advantage of the opportunity against blind guests
Holt's team with their direct game, which in a variety of ways made it difficult for the Rangers, should have been in the lead long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but pulled his try in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping on his legs to prevent Craig Halkett's hit with his head across the gate line was unsuccessful.
The hosts allowed the "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And this is how the decisive gates came into being.
The Rangers allowed a free-kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and the Robinsons teamed up to provide an opportunity for Menga, who hit and got a goal from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, Rangers managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had Kelly save the goal.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov missed the goal in the combination of "Livingston".
Centred balls continued to appear in the Livingston area, but two calls for a penalty — after Halket fought for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for hand-to-hand play — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and result of "Livingston".
Each of them was excellent, continuing to surpass expectations, always improving performance.
The style and personality of their game has practically not changed since their return to the top echelon, but Holts has earned great praise for how he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great man, with excellent organized protection, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall would always remain vigilant.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how well they were sometimes subjected to Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they broke into the part of the owner's field — and it's basically a wake-up call for the "Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
What is the difference between the two?
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue skies.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police, as a reason to mention security, blocked a large crowd of 25,000 people, not allowing to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also made their views known, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to take him with them.
The mutual protests of the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guests, some of whom consider the German Turk to be a hero, while others denounce him as an autocrat.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, at a section of road with heavy traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and was assisted by a doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Sunday collision. At that time, the driver left the crash site.
The police department of the capital announced that the police are dealing with the identification of the man and the information of their relatives.
There are closed roads and diverted buses at the scene, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Workers Wounded During Disruption
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff members were injured in the riots in the men's strict prison regime.
The riots broke out at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
In order to prevent the occurrence of disturbances involving eight prisoners bounded by a single wing, the staff of the special service "Tornado" were involved.
Workers were treated for mild facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "In order to resolve the incident at HMP Long Lartin prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not be content with violence in our prisons and we will make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
And in October last year, the staff responsible for controlling the dumps were sent to prison to solve the serious mess in which the staff had attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City are at risk of sudden flooding (it is likely that the drought-affected areas will benefit from the situation)
Arizona suffers from tropical depression infrequently, but this is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rosa will move with residual force across the desert southwest, posing a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southeastern part of California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Flagstaff.
Rosa is expected to make her way directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday with the case.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a Twitter post that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other desert areas in the southwest, including the central part of the Klin<0xC5><0xA1>u Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54–5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, the Pink Rain can become a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
While the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to come in handy, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. drought control (Drought Monitor), slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of the Orc<0xC3><0xA1>n Rosa leads to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rosa still with the power of the hurricane on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km).
The wind meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore subsides.
Therefore, it is expected that the hurricane with the force of a tropical storm will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the rain gas part of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"Rainfalls are expected to reach 3–6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from Lower California in the southwest of Sonora, with rainfall likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and arrive south of Utah on Tuesday late evening.
"The main threat to be expected from Rosa or her debris is very strong rainfall in Lower California, the Sonora Northwest, and the U.S. desert southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudflows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsommer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
Police said the 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in the Redstoke (Radstock) area, Eivonne and Somerset.
Police have called on anyone who might have a mobile phone to report what happened to them.
Trump Claims Caveno Suffered From Democratic Party's "Evil and Anger"
"The vote on Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Caveno has suffered from the Democratic Party's "evil and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the course of the hearing about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of America saw" Caveno's "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote to approve Judge Caveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history of serving the people," he told supporters in West Virginia.
President Caveno mentioned the circumstances when he spoke about the importance of republican activity in the mid-term elections.
"We have five weeks until one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't run, but I actually ran," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have taken on a mission to "protest and resist."
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Caveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior aide of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people have been killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people had been killed, many simply washed away when giant waves hit the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday at the festival in Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the festive beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves hit the shore in the chair, wiping many to death and destroying everything that was in their way.
Tsunami erupted after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still operating on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they became victims," BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Many people crawled into the trees to escape, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photographs taken during the flight of the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
In the afternoon, the coastal city continued to shake on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (AITA) in a statement to BPPT stressed that the energy emitted by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have reinforced the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications "were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongala," informed Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are travelling to the disaster-affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami had visited Palu, although officials claimed that the waves came at the time of the warning announcement.
A video posted on social media says that a man on the top floor of a building is desperately calling people on the street at the bottom that a tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, washing the buildings and machines.
The news agency Reuters was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was genuine.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electrical power, which cut off communications to Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city airport is open only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the World Vision staff, who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Donggala, and now live in the basement of the office yard in the basement of the office building, were on their way to the scene of the disaster.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that were broken down," he explained.
This is very bad.
Even when aid groups have been determined to organise aid for victims of disasters, some have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to go to Pali.
Under Indonesian law, funding, resources and personnel of overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the postal territory is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross representative in Indonesia.
"When the government announces, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been determined."
When Palu arrived on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, still-undiscovered people’s friends and family continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that make the gloomier life during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days, next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's national paraglider team, had been preparing two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped in the hotel "Roa Roa", including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "teach me the essence of emotion."
Mr. Gendon remembered that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paraglider team, he sent messages to the participants of the Palu competition who took part in the beach festival for desperate hours.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages didn't reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the filling of the ATM in the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled the ATM in the Newport on the Levee complex on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man "attended the Brink's employee from behind" and stole the purse from the ATM.
According to the press release, witnesses noticed several suspicious persons leaving the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the rapper changes his name to Je
Reperis Kanje West changes its name to Ye (Je).
Notifying about the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being who previously known as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West has long been called Je, and used the nickname as his eighth album, which was released in June, as a title ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show say that he replaces the singer Arianu Grandi on the show, who stopped working on the "emotional cause".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", who is thinking about the good and the bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more reflective of who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, said this year that he prefers the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesta, has also not used the word sign and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of student bloodletting is approaching.
Lopes Obradors on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to oppress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, a peaceful demonstration was staged by the army unit, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing grants to students each month and by opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into the hands of criminals.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies issued notifications on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks strategies in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a major country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next milestone in artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in the only means of understanding the power of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked to build an artificial intelligence system that would outperform America’s best Othello (Reverse) player, but later he was a senior employee of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government-organized technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with the idea.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that disappoints the leading scientists, but the big companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university graduates to work on artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a doctorate in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that the China National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the U.S. Department of Defense’s Central Research and Development Organization) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “AI Next.”
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for several months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" by taking a step that will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that its northern neighbour's name indicates claims to its territory and has vetoed the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists insist that the changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott has raised concerns about whether voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The question is asked in the referendum bulletin: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
To change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission informed that no irregularities had been reported by one in the afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zajev, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and their son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko (Dushko) cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name that will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at tents, which had been imposed by those who had boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to step in with our heads held high, not through the servants' doors," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the fact that more than 80"percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the result "yes" would "confirm our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) shows that 30<0xE2><0x88><0x92>43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, less than the required activity.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV "Telma TV" found that 57 percent of voters plan to take part in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them responded that they would vote for.
For a referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero slips through all of Brighton's defenses to get a goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton by allowing Manchester City to win the match at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton, and threw himself into the free field.
Then Agvero untied four green shirts.
He guided the ball to one defender, then in the race he overcame several more on the side of the Brighton field.
Then he made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The striker of the English center used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put in the right football boot to catch the goalie Matthew Ryan (Matthew Ryan), hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We with their deliberations played 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he got the goal at the time.
However, it was Sterling who secured the Sky Blues' original lead in the Premier League.
The gates were opened in the 29th minute.
Agvero in it plays the ball received deep in the territory of "Brighton".
He sent the ball with a beautiful kick along Leroy Sane's left leg.
In San Francisco, he made several shots until he entrusted Sterling to deliver the ball to the further goal post.
The Sky Blues centre forward easily hit the ball in the net just before crossing the border.
"City"fights with "Hoffenheim" Champions League group matches on Tuesday at 12.55 pm on Tuesday at "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinnsheim, Germany.
Sherman wants to solve the problem of "Rockies"
Since Nationals did not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart yet.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to use the opportunity against the Colorado "Rockies" on Sunday, but only if the "Rockies" will be up-to-date exclusion games. And the "Rockies" in the National League Western group is led by one game against the Los Angeles "Dodgers".
"Rockies" have squeezed out at least a white card on Friday evening with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but still haven't won their first title in the division.
"Even if we play the same way, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most heated I'll be facing this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but as they say, they are ready to let Chercer take the shot.
If you are a member of the European Parliament, you have the right to vote in the European Parliament, the Council, the Council, the Council and the European Parliament.
Washington's bat is 18<0xE2><0x88><0x92>7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts for 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The President referred to the situation in which his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Caveno, was involved, while at the same time talking about the importance of the activity of the republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done in November is in jeopardy.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious — I didn't run, but I actually ran, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrid, horrid group of radical democrats that is acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, contrary action.
They don't care what they hurt, who they have to break in order to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have taken on a mission to "protest and resist."
"And you've seen the same thing in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil, evil, ugly and untrue."
He named on behalf of Senators of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee on Justice Diane Feinstein, to whom the audience responded with loud cries.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you flush the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait — it was a really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is insufferable to the public
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to be censored.
After all, I am the last member of the Labour Party to date, who was informed that he was not wanted — all because we are not hiding our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was similarly misled because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of an economically responsible policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically, but those were issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Labour meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham said on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MPs were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and promises of a "better, gentler" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate differences of opinion, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues who I think our political views are similar began to expect me to turn around 180 degrees and accept views that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was a threat to the EU or not.
When I speak in public — and what I am saying is not important at all — I am following a talk about social media use, calling for a ban on running for the next elections, exposing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face the current of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to avoid submission.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal the use has become.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn announced that the Labour Party needed to work out a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of views and with every expression of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the last two years, I have often given advice, asking not to go to the ecesis, think about what I am talking about, and then "everything will be fine" with me.
But that’s not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy in response to the neglect of the Techer government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I have set the task of fighting for better public services for those who are most in need of such services — the grassroots.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the previous elections.
No one in the east of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on policy issues and on areas where I disagreed with the current government.
For those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the state is resolutely moving towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But basically, the only thing I want to say is not the "Momentum" of Nottingham, but to say to your voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of denial of candidacy or reminders that no one is going to keep me in politics, no one is going to tell me, no one is going to keep me in politics, no one is going to tell me.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unspoken "Ayr" reaches the highest rows in the table
The last two attempts may have seemed to be the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unsung team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and the much better use of opportunities that guided the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tested all our games and we're still not winning, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "With all due respect, Ayr, they used their chances better than we did."
In the 14th minute, an attempt by Frazier Climo was put forward by Ayr, but the yellow card was given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been awarded the "Warriors" by him, and the number of Begregios was changed to "Melrose" by Begregio.
Klimo increased the management of Ayr with a penalty, right at the end of the half-time, he gained points, then realized a solo attempt, thus Ayr went on a break with 17-5.
However, the Melrose half started with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Begott made, reduced the gap to 5 points.
Then there was a long break, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was carried away from the field on the stretcher, but when the game restarted "Ayr" quickly moved forward when Stafford McDowall made the move.
Ayr's current captain Bleir Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and once again, under intense pressure, Melrose used a superfluous player — with an attempt by Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the hosts rallied, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for crossing Klimo without a ball, from the penalty corridor, McPherson made a touchdown on the back of the "Ayr" pier.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the very beginning, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong into the field of play and sent the flank player Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the hosts.
"Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in restaurant business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems to be planning to get involved in the hospitality business, because it turns out that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show he is creating and in which he participates with his former partner in comedy Greg Hemphill.
Duets has announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and Kirnan is apparently planning his life after Kreiglang (Craiglang).
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at the Scottish Sun said Kirnan planned to get involved in Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, stranded on land, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the docked Fleet Headquarters in Lapas.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
The ships of the fleet base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s 19th-century bloody conflict over resources is still alive, just as it has been long since sailing in the Pacific again.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, with positive thoughts is waiting for the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many citizens of the International Court of Justice will observe the verdict on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that, after several decades of negotiations with interruptions, Chile's duty is to discuss the sovereign exit to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic president of local origin, Evo Morales, who is waiting for a controversial re-election battle next year, is also very interested in Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he said, exasperated at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the judgment in favour of Bolivia is unreliable and, even if it is adopted, no major changes are expected.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and its representatives have expressed that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is handed down six months after the final hearing shows that the case "wasn't complicated", explained the international regulatory expert Paz Zarate (Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate) from Chile.
And the last four years of the Bolivian case have not moved forward, but, on the contrary, delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric in Chile has tarnished the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, disagreed that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to put an end to the 139-year-old conflicts from which both sides will benefit," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used maritime problems as political crooks.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to understand what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will only give up nuclear weapons if it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the meeting of the two leaders in Singapore.
His comments were echoed at a time when it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is ready to resume the deadlocked diplomatic measures to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri claims that they are "fantasy" to hope that the US, still unrepealed by sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War, will ever make North Korea throw itself in the way.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang carries out any significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up its weapons, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim's next meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show Introduces the Latest Massive Headgear Line On The Way To You Nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced the audience to a line of absurd, huge head-wearing items in the spring/summer 2019 collection that graced the backdrop of Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to show off in fashion.
The most outstanding feature of Valentine’s Day was a gorgeous beige hat decorated with feather-like wide edges that adorned the head.
Among the massive accessories were watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapples — but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a selection of strange masks —just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips, and they were more likely to be worn by Hannibal Lekter than by high fashion.
One of the formations was reminiscent of breathing apparatus for diving, with tubes and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue in a massive fashion, then the right time has come.
Style observers believe that the huge ravens are likely on the way to you nearest High Street.
Larger hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn everything from Rihanna to Emily Ratajowski.
The very impractical status of hats as a cult item in all social networks led to yet another big feat on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit-wearing model that wore it.
Reddish yellow raffia bag decorated with raffia bars and equipped with a white leather handle took a special place "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in the spring/summer season 2019 collection of Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to show up in the central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left such an impression that it will be difficult to ignore the whims of the demand."
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for excellence in educational institutions, and it has maintained that reputation in 2018 when, once again, excellent exam results were obtained, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art music and other public events.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aims to ensure the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set themselves the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their life as world citizens.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak in a human language that he understands, it stays in his mind.
If you speak in his native language, it remains in his heart."
This is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
Scottish Independent School Council data on 74 schools show that 72 per cent of students received the highest grade A in Chinese, and the same grade also received 72 per cent who learned German, 69 per cent who learned French, and 63 per cent who learned Spanish.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland for foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as a subject of choice, in independent school programs are valued as high as science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) group subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for their failure to fill vacancies.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increase in job opportunities where language skills will be required, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, by learning a foreign language, they will gain a real advantage in the future, which is provided by such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages spoken.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 per cent did not understand a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, but French was the only one that spoke a double-digit number of people, at 15 per cent.
That is why learning the languages of investment is important for today's children.
Multiple languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common languages of today, while others will learn languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the future of the UK, according to plans until 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field in question.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a language environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages would be regarded as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (This must be done).
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will debut in the composition of the "Lakers" on Sunday in San Diego
Fans have finally waited for the moment when LeBron's first game in the Los Angeles "Lakers" will take place.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's pre-season opening game against Denver's Nuggets San Diego.
But we still have to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one, but less than 48," Volton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James would likely be limited to a limited number of minutes in the games.
Continuing this week's practice, James asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason series.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Time of the Trump myth in West Virginia, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies in Willings, West Virginia today.
This is the first of five Trampling rallies planned for next week, including stops at friendly venues, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump’s goal is to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress following the November vote.
How will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place today and how will it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for seven in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is expected to talk about this week’s hearing in Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno’s case, which has been made too tight by charges of sex crimes, and the expected Senate vote to delay approval for a week until the FIB will make out.
However, the main purpose of this rally is to help improve the situation for Republicans, who are expected to vote in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign shows that the task of this five-meeting next week is to “activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and increase the majority that belongs to them in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible because we are launching a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening’s event, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willings, will likely attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and reflect it in the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Maurice that the president has to come to help improve his results in the polls," Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Raider Cup 2018: U.S. has demonstrated determination to fight to maintain high hopes for Sunday singles
After three "one-word" sessions on Wednesday afternoon in the format of the game "foursome" was possible exactly what was needed for this Raider Cup.
Athletes love to talk about fluctuations in success, and they really believe in it, especially in competitions like these.
So which side do they think is successful now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, because I think that in a way that means success has come to us," Jordan Spieth said as he went on his way.
Europe, of course, has priority because it is in the lead with 4 points, but another 12 will be played out.
Spit explained that Americans believe that the wind blows in their sails and they have a reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas) who played together all day, and each of them can boast of three points out of four.
The spit has been destructive from the point of the first hit to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
Those guttural victory cries became louder and louder as his round continued, a decisive blow was made in the pit to achieve the same number of hits four times, when he and Tomass were behind for two hits after two.
His hit in the pit, which reached their 15th victory, was perceived with a similar cry, from them, for his confidence that the American team has not yet been ejected.
"You really have to run deep, and you have to worry about your match," Spitt said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to get good luck.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple is behind by four points and will not be able to harm.
Molivud was the only couple who survived without a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and in the last nine o’clock hours on Friday morning.
This course and the way in which their energy flows to this crazy crowd and back convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Fl<0xC3><0xAD>tvud with Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It is desirable for both at the same time in different pitfalls.
However, the talk of Europe's triumph was premature.
Baba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) quickly dealt with the character of this morning's "fourballs" in the format of Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogius and the two doubles in the front nine led the Spaniards and the Swedes into the caesarean section, and they were not even close to worshiping it.
However, there is no one on Sunday who will help to cope.
Games in the formats of "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch closely due to the interaction of couples, observing what advice they give and what they do not, and how the strategy can immediately change the situation.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last days is in a distant lead, but this competition in the format of "foursome" showed that the U.S. team is determined to fight for what many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
European team on the last day of the Raider Cup is in charge 10-6
The final day of the Raider Cup will start with a pleasant run after Saturday's fourball and foursome races finished 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were in charge with two wins over the hard-working Taiger Woods, who increased the number of points "Le Golf National" to four.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, to retain the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning races in the format of fourballs, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more vigorously in the format of foursomes, winning two matches, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
The Jim Furyk team needs 8 points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fl<0xC3><0xAD>tvud is the first European champion to score four points in a row with the Molinaires, named Molliwood after a sensational weekend is only the second pair in Raider's Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
In the format of Woods and Patrick Reed's "fourballs", they then easily beat the tired Woods and American newcomer, Brian Dechambeau, in a brilliant game with an even more delicate result of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a great game at times, but he has lost 19 of the 29 matches in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, plus seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning of the fourballs, returned to the foursomes of his partner Henrik Stenson to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka in the first and second innings with 2&1.
Europe failed to achieve its full potential, even though the day in the south-west of Paris was pleasant and windy.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They squeezed 2&1 against Spain’s John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the form of fourballs and came back later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 foursomes after losing the first half.
Only two times in the history of the Raider Cup, the team has played 4 points in the deficit in single games, but as owners, the team Faryk (Furyk) is only enough with an indistinguishable result to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, as it seems, Sunday's counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm in "any" case, without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions has deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea will in no case unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons tests, and the de-escalation of nuclear weapons at the nuclear test site.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the US," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm the first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known rebuke of Washington’s resistance to the “gradual” approach to denuclearization, under which Korea will be compensated for the gradual steps taken, his statement left an impression as it did not automatically reject the one-sided denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to achieve the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the safety of the Zweibr<0xC3><0xBC>cken.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to heed the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that 'denuclearization must come first,' and raises the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve the goal with power, even in opposition to 'the declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could put us on the road is empty fantasies that people who don’t know anything about us have.
However, the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not talk about the intentions for Kim's second meeting with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned when speaking at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically highlighted three meetings with Kim during the past five months with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the other side of this denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, there would be no denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech differed dramatically from that of last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the deployment of North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Bad President Mr. Trump” had called himself “Miss Kim.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but stressed that there was still much to be done, and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea's withdrawal.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what it has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be vigorously pursued without error until a final and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an effort to end the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of "gangster worthy demands".
North Korea's meeting with Moon this month pledged to dismantle the weapons range and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" North Korea wants to see are security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University will learn a subject of study on how to relax enough
A new study subject at Harvard University this year has resulted in students sleeping more, and it is an attempt to address an increasingly popular culture of brutality that includes caffeine-filled study through the night.
One teacher found that the best university students in the world often do not even have a basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a study subject that he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
Inspiration to create a new subject of study for him arose after speaking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why are you telling me this only now that I'm in the last class?'
She discovered that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the taught subject provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievements in learning and sports, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce a course of study after learning that students suffer from a severe lack of sleep during the study week.
The long-term training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the sections is a picture of the dorm doors, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and how important is a bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect health," added Professor <0xC3><0x87>eisler.
He said that a culture in which pride in the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be provided by the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, overwork and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep in the brain switches to starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a subject after attending one of the professor’s lectures last year, Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of study has opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who obtain a postgraduate education to learn a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaisler advises students to install an alarm not only for the time when they will rise, but also when they will go to sleep, as well as to keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, because they can disrupt the rhythm of the day, making it difficult.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's gate bypasses Gerard's viruses
"Rangers" attended another sad game of the guests when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard (Steven Gerrard's confused team decision 1 - 0 loss against "Livingston".
The Ibrox team had been hoping for their first win since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team provided Gerard with his second loss in 18 games since he became the club's manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish opener.
Menga put the ball in the goal seven minutes before the end of the half, and the lack of inspiration for the Rangers did not look at all after trying to level the score.
"Rangers" fall to sixth place, while "Livingston" climbs to third, and in terms of the gate difference it is surpassed only by "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" can be another problem, because the assistant judge Kalum Spence needed medical help because of the head injury, apparently caused by the object from the far end of the throw.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind Ayr, reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holts, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingston, who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-trained team beat opponents in each episode.
The Rangers may have managed the ball more often, but Livingston had better use of what they were doing.
They were supposed to get the goal two minutes after the start, when Meng's first game sent Scott Pittman in the direction of Alan McGregor's goal, but the center player missed his big opportunity.
Then the long free kick of Kegan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was able to send the ball only far away to the rear pole.
"Rangers" took control, but there was an impression that the game in the last third is expected, not believed, to happen.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt that he should have made a penalty kick in the 15th minute after colluding with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Columbian call.
The Rangers made only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't particularly bothered, neither by Lassana Coulibaly's head-butt, nor by the modest attack by Ovie Ejaria.
While the 34th minute might have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already deserved it for their efforts.
"Rangers" again did not cope with Jacobs' planned long combination.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
At the break, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Raina Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately manages to block.
However, "Livingston" continued to force the guests to play as they liked, with Litgov and Halket making one long beat after another.
Holt's team would have been able to continue the lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well in stopping Jacobs before Litgov made a head-to-head kick from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, asked for another penalty kick in the late game after colliding with Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany was born Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, as a result of which, in the end, was a device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has taken its place in science, has also taken its place in pop culture, as, for example, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (the bells of Coronado), in which the main roles were played by the outside unconvincing cowboy-type scientists Roger and Degers:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll be able to hear how the atoms that release these minerals work."
Evans: "Certainly, it really did suck!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named in his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
Within the framework of vaccine therapy, the immune system learns to recognize malignant cells
When using this method, immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" the protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with a variety of malignancies.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize malignant cells experienced ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining from the patient's immune system cells, transforming them in a laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2, characteristic of several tumors, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzovsky said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumors," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectal cancers, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, when the patient acquires immune cells, which "taught" how to attack malignant tumor cells, has been affected by one type of leukemia.
Kanje West after visiting SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked Trump critics.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was cast in the Saturday Night Live show after a controversial performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After finishing the third song of the night, which was called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to chant loud phrases about the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault charge of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media using Vesta's graces.
It is not clear if Rox tried to make West laugh in this way.
And yet the West lamented to the spectators for the fact that they had behaved badly against him behind the scenes because of his scalp.
"They threw me in the back!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head!"
They made fun of me!
And yet they said that I had lost touch with reality," West told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?", and promised to put on "your Superman enclosure," because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try love!”
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the whistles of the audience at least twice, but the members of the show team looked lonely, and at least one person told the press release: "The study was completely silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Arianna Grandi (Ariana Grande), who a few days ago had a deceased friend rapper Max Miller (Mac Miller).
West sang a song (I Love it) that he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
Vestu was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandance Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the strongest people in the spirit: THANK YOU FOR NOT GIVING THE PUP!"
However, conversation show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his 'art') who I believe supports and brushes with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he has now become "a being previously known as Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the casual music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol, but then to "a stage artist who used to be known as Prince".
The accused in the murder attempt for the collision in the Belfast restaurant has been charged
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot dead in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballihackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (Public Prosecution Service).
"Stronger Games" star Kits Heringtons turns against toxic masculinity
Kite Herington is known as swordsman John Snow in HBO's ruthless medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they must be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that she thought there was a “problem” and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that this problem is important to him.
“I can’t think about what mistakes we’ve made with masculinity,” he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem, when they grow up, given the existing problem?"
Kit believes that television, with its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: "Who is born, but who is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because with young men, obviously, there are problems."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not participate in any sequel to the "Game of Thrones" or trick, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "there are tired battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the renewed Sam Shepard's "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife on this show because it was in a way securing my current family and my life from that moment on," he said.
The Pink Emmy Award-winning fantasy series was played by Other character John Snow's beloved Igriti.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual relations, which indicates a change.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked Republican senators' data, lashing out at "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday denied allegations that her staffer had published the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were spread by "ultra-right" wing overlords and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more obnoxious lies," Voters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the leaked information includes the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, at a time when a Senate panel was hearing the Supreme Court-nominated Breta Caveno’s allegations of sexual misconduct.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators had interviewed Caveno.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Voters' office, and disclosed information about Voters' staff, Hills said.
"This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and completely false!" said Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to this fraudulent and false allegation, is in no way responsible for the information leak.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
The Waters statement soon drew criticism online, including criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, this person must not be angry.
He must not be a soldier.
He may not speak out on the accused's motives.
He has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer's task was to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic fall of Judge Caveno, who was accused of overly angry reaction during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is running to get Waters to lose the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great, if true," he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted the authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits are found," she continued, "and that they are found to be legally responsible for all of their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny Anglis 3" review - Rovan Atkinson's parody of spy movies left in the half-hour
It has become customary to look for associations with Brexit in every new British-flavored film, and this seems to also apply to this one that has revived Johnny English’s showbiz comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with “Return to England” and “Return to England” in 2011.
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation, a toothless purge of ourselves, of how obviously hopeless we are?
In any case, incompetent Johnny England, with his eyes open and his face unusually moving, has the right to create a jukebox after the second revival — his name more than anything else signals that he is a broad-spectrum comic character, designed for areas where consumers don’t speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims to charming sophistication, is a bit of a kluzo, a little Mr. Bean, and a friend of the guy who plays one note in the "Chariots of Fire" theme of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also based on the traveler and the international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left a mess on his way.
The youngest Johnny in the English adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny England goes on a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor suit, and the propeller blades flash for a moment against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is well visible, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially because "serious" movie brands such as "007" and "The Impossible Mission" themselves confidently use comedy as one of the intricacies.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion the absurdities of Johnny English are not as creative and purposeful as the tricks of Atkinson's meme film in the skin of Bina.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
The hacker has broken into Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all of Britain’s agents in this area, as a distaste for the active agent — a pitifully small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pompous and conflict-ridden person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Tomsone is doing what she can, with Theresa May partially similar characters, but there is not much to work with in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers inform that, as all active spies have been exposed, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the immaculate Johnny of England, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because England offers to learn the profession from the very foundations.
The Englishman is taken back to Waitholu for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former many-victim assistant Bo, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Bo now has a married husband, married to an underwater commander, a fun character that becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully used.
And so, while serving in Her Highness’ secret service, Batman and Robin have returned to meet the beautiful, fateful woman Ofelia Lodi (Ophelia Bulletova) portrayed by Olga Kirillenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister has dangerously tamed the charismatic tech billionaire, the evil Jason Volta, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer cache.
Anglis and Bo begin their odyssey of wild fun: disguised as officiants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion by sneaking into a Volta luxury yacht; and Anglis causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual reality on the head display to intersperse the Volazpei.
Everything possible is done for the final run, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it has a lot of children's television elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is set to discuss a radical plan that would see the British work four days a week while receiving a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders with the help of artificial intelligence revolution to allocate the saved to workers, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend, while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the senior representatives of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in a day, but a four-day workweek is an idea that meets the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day workweek already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not currently support this hunger.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to give a round-up to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonald explained that he had committed himself to taking power away from the "mass of directors" and from the "speculators" of public service companies.
The shadow cabinet minister's plan also means that existing middle-market shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire package, as the Labour government could implement the "reduction" because of the injustice allowed.
He also approved plans to include working company boards and set up exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of private sector company capital to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes" whether the FIB investigation into the Caveno case could change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the office’s findings could force a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about whether the FIB could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open-minded man than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, when I looked at the hearing procedure, I said that I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened, when the accusation became known, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and clear."
However, Grema's vote is obviously a stone's throw.
"I've made a decision about Bret Caveno, and a devastating accusation will be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will take place the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the Festival of World Citizens will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Great Wall of Central Park to enjoy performances not only like Janet Jackson, rapper Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also the event itself.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international advocacy group the Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or "activities", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or performing some other important activity.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, with 12 years to go to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to get people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "cliché" when people think they can really influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters in an effort to achieve various goals.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than US$37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities for which at least US$10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated to date have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a UK-based investor-executive partnership committed to "helping children grow up to be full", pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's undernutrition after more than 4700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave behind a history of poor nutrition social injustice," said Tracy Ullman, representative of The Power of Nutrition, at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after launching more than 5,000 measures, calling on the UK government to provide better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on their website — "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and a long road in which for a while we will stumble and fail.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have done, we too will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use military fleet for "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
"If necessary, Washington can use its war fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East," U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s activities in Syria — especially in places where it operates under a legitimate government invitation — are a stepping stone to exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason it's in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its war fleet, can ensure that the sea lanes are open, as well as block them if necessary, so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the audience who had come to attend an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they are actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
Claims are made that the Trump administration is promoting exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials and also US President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has once again confirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin said after a recent meeting, the head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) Dieter Kempf.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president after the mid-term elections.
During the session of the Council in Holioka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president.
"It is the right time for Washington to have women who will 'swap' the imperfect government, which also means women presidents," her words reflected in the newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the U.S. presidential election."
Warren referred to President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his chosen Supreme Court nominee, Bret Caveno.
On Friday, Warren said in a Twitter post: "Of course, the FIB needs to be investigated before the elections."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was revealed that the majority of supporters of Warren do not believe that she should run in the 2020 elections.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Studies/The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run for office.
Thirty-two per cent supported such a decision.
The results of the poll revealed that former governor Deval Patrick had gained more support, receiving 38 percent for the candidacy vote and 48 percent against.
Further to the possible candidacy for the 2020 election, such high-profile Democratic Party operatives as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
The Associated Press reported that Baiden has pledged to make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Peilin Quotes by Trek Peilin at Donald Trump's rally
Treks Peilins (26) spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through after returning, I can relate to other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the certain dose-injuries that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilina called his arrest an "obvious problem that everyone seems invisible" and said of his son and other veterans of the war that "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what the soldiers are doing and what they are doing."
According to Dan Bennet, a representative of the Vasilis Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasilis, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a weapon while in a state of riot.
18 states, the District of Colombia met the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum-seekers fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The 18 states and representatives of the District of Columbia in Washington on Friday submitted a brief statement to a court counselor in support of asylum seekers who have faced obstacles created by the policy, reports NBC News.
The applicant’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, launched in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and her violent gang member's son" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Greis described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries with a widespread problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Carlos Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores the national, federal and international laws that have been introduced for decades".
"The Federal Law provides that all requests for asylum are dealt with in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court's counsel said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer said in his statement that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country harm the U.S. economy, as these immigrants would likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called on immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang-related abuse, and said they would not be able to do so.
"The asylum is available to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, ethnicity, membership of a particular social group or political views," Sessions said in his June 11 statement regarding the policy.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, the number of casualties doubled during the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old R<0xC4><0xAB>za Kusuma, calming her feverish baby at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"For a minute, the ambulance service is bringing in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The inhabitants were visible, returning to their destroyed houses and moving the objects that had vanished into the water, trying to save everything that had been found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had suffered from the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had a broken spine and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being cared for outside due to the relentless strong aftershocks.
In his eyes, tears burst as the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which he was standing with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I seem to have been imprinted in the wall debris," Harry told Associated Press, suggesting that his family had come to the city for the purpose of the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Attempting to Scare by Using Propaganda Ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper came out with a four-page ad highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade on a daily basis, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to an appendices paid to China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, but China denies it.
Trump’s outspoken accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, which was a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other’s imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs were aimed at exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion for Sunday's edition of the Des Moines Register, claiming that China "now doubles this scare by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of free speech and free press to its advantage in America by placing a paid ad for the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here in the ordinary newsstand of Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not see the real reflection of such different opinions, which may be for the Chinese people in connection with China's worrying economic trajectory, and you will notice that there is a wide range of
He suggested that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating women's voters from midterm elections, which are involved in the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been the subject of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that in the upcoming midterm elections they will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been ready to give up their vote.
Such things cannot be ruled out, "Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School of Politics, told The Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Ryher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last-minute push to conduct a FIB investigation will be a reason enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and country representative for the progressive MoveOn movement, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate Chamber, when Republicans, who are in charge of the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue with Caveno's candidacy despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, that's right.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban living volatile voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29) who often don't go to the polls even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she presented allegations of sexual assault from the Supreme Court’s nominee, analysts cited a possible failure if Republicans continued to run for office.
"It has become a playful mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a statement to NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how Republicans have dealt with the situation and how they've treated him," said Guy Cecil, the director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps the president.
However, it seems that Americans are a little divided as to who to believe after Ford and Caveno's testimony, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are certain or mostly inclined to believe Caveno’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may or may not have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleika’s urging, the FIB is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno had drunk alcohol at the age of 17 against his sexual assault.
Ramirez claims that during his studies in Jeil in the 1980s, a candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at a party.
Global Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Take Over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the open source platform "Solid" by B<0xC4><0x93>rners-L<0xC4><0xAB>.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses "Solid" technology so that people can create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of works to be done, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available simultaneously in one browser.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal authority through the use of data".
According to company manager John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates in Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change by completely flipping all their business models in one night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an article published by the platform Medium on Saturday, B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-Lee said that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid base".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, B<0xC3><0xA4>rnersam-Lee has been influential in the discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, B<0xC3><0xA4>rners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Marking of the Cross of Victoria awarded to a clergyman during World War I
For 100 years now, it has been celebrated in its native city when the only clergyman of the Church of England received the cross of Victoria during the First World War as a fighter.
Honorable Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellengliss and Lehaukort.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he also did not know about the highest British military award won.
On a Saturday show in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellent symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vens led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and artillery and mortar-fires."
Later he rushed to the firing line and with the greatest confidence drove this line forward before the capture of the gun zone, where he made three groupings.
Lieutenant-Colonel Venu was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vens (72) said that his grandfather's action was "something I could never do, and at the same time it is also a very humble action".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also performed with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens claimed that he felt "honored by participating in this show" and praised that "the value of a true hero is evidenced by the support provided by many people".
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206, but instead waited for Puppy Pep
Imagine spending the whole night upstairs to see the Bellator 206, but in the end you are denied a look at this main event.
The San Jose Post included 13 fights, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live all night long on Channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6.00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were pleasantly surprised by the change of broadcast to Puppy Pep.
Some were in a real misunderstanding when they had stayed up all night until early in the morning, waiting for the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "failed joke".
"The government has determined that after 6:00 this type of content is not acceptable, so there was a switch to the children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator.
"Pussy Pepa," "yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would work on scheduling so that viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts in the future.
"Thinking about re-broadcasting, I think we'll be able to sort it out somehow," Kokers said.
"However, the clock is there at six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, after switching the broadcast appeared a lot of texts, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problem.
We will stick to five fights, not six (as it has been so far). We tried to please the fans, but we overdid it.
This is a failed situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Delile did not feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until the moment he started attending high school.
Visiting the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs" led by Loren Laverne, he said that he began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has been away for several months due to a restful illness.
Appearing to be expelled from society in the first program of Laverne, Deliles said that as he grew up he felt "less valuable" than others, because "in society it is not accepted that both girls and boys can like each other."
He said: "Until today, feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main engine that gave me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" to keep people from despairing when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become the leader of a high-level LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on even more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was a surprise unprepared."
Delile married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, and claimed that the age gap was never an obstacle.
"When you went through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Delile claimed that her "whole perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, all that was important to me was winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things in life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Delile mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Delile about was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, in which he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until the moment he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Delile participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I'd dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of the housekeeper at the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song, "Proud", performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to Olympic achievements and continues to ignite the buzz.
The programme "Desert Island Discs" will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. after British summer time.
What is the most important thing you can do to improve your health?
American Phil Mickelson (Phil Mickelson) will set a record Sunday by playing his 47th Raider Cup game, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
Mikelson, who already participates in the championship every two years for the 12th time, captain Jim Furyk sat on the bench for Saturday’s four ball games and two pair games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has so often been the case with the US teams, the fifth winner divided his day by acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for a tight fight at Le Golf National in an uneven field where inaccurate shots are regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn’t scary enough, Mikelson will fight the exact winner of the British Open Championship, Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the ninth match of Sunday’s match to get to this point.
If the Americans, who are behind with four points, start 12 single-game matches, successfully put themselves in the lead, the Mikkelson match could prove to be of decisive importance.
Furiks expressed his confidence in his team-mate without words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, patted me on the back, put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've imagined him playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything changed the way it did, and that is what we will be counting on.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mikelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played matches in the Raider Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raider's Cup racing career, which never really coincided with his individual record highs.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, 20 losses and seven undisclosed games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic and witty, he likes to talk about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the younger players also liked to tease him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
Thomas Bjorn, European captain of the European team, knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly fade away.
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Raider Cup in the final days of a single game can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Denmark made their debut at the 1997 Games in Valderrama, where an opponent team captained by Sev Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small lead, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were significantly ahead in the lead in Valderrama; we were ahead in the lead in National-3 in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a slight majority," said Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn (pictured), looking out for the Group of the Year 5.
Thus, history will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give yourself everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not be finished until the points obtained are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to win this trophy and we will also focus on it.
I have always said that I focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very well aware of who is on the other side against us – the best players in the world.”
Facilitated by the performance of his players on the golf course, Bjorn said: "I was never pleased with the weather.
There are new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual games are planned, and this is a completely different thing.
It’s great when you have a partner next to you when things are going well, but your golfer’s skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message you have to pass to your players, that is, that they in the next day of the game give themselves everything.
Now you leave your partner, and he should also go show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opposing team, Captain Jim Furrick will see his players show their best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these important final days of the tournament – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later suffering defeat when the European teams gained a sensational success, which later in the golf world is also known as the "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, united his players for the final day of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get into the fast-paced rush that you experienced in Brooklyn, that you experienced in Medina, right away.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates a lot of pressure in relation to mid-games.
We formed our composition accordingly and sorted the guys in the way that we thought was right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack, and he assigned Rory McIlroy to the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram (Jon Rahm), Tommy Flytwood (Tom) and Tommy Flytwood (Tom McIlroy).
"I've sorted the guys in this order because I think it fits best during the tournament," Bjorns said of the selected singles.
The commissioning of the new German warship has been postponed again
Germany’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014, replacing aging Cold War warships, but it won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate class has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, as reported in the newspaper "Die Zeit", quoting a representative of the military field.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the unpleasant post-shipment problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, ordered by the navy in 2007, will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the latest technological warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, will already be obsolete by the time it comes into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unsuccessful frigate F125 was visible in all the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the caraflotte had returned it to the shipyard after the ship had been delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned several significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship unusable if it were used in a combat mission.
The software shortages were a particularly significant factor, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors, which is only half the older Bremen class frigate personnel.
It also proved to be too heavy for the ship, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to make improvements in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said that its costs reached EUR 3.1 billion instead of the EUR 2.2 billion originally foreseen.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly significant, given recent warnings of a reduction in German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy was indeed "starting to run out of usable ships".
The official claimed that over time this problem has significantly collapsed, as old ships are taken out of service, but no new ones are delivered instead.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates had joined the Kara fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the secret life of bats
The new study, which is being conducted at a Scottish Highlands property, is aimed at finding out how bats use the landscape in the process of searching for food.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help in their future protection measures.
Scientists from the National Trust in Scotland will study dandelions, pygmy dandelions, as well as brown terns and night-wings in the gardens of Invereves in Westeros.
Special recorders will be placed in the main places of the property, which will track the activities of the wings throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency of flapping calls and which species perform specific actions.
A biotope map and report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view that reflects the behaviour of the fins.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland development and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the population of fins in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are at risk of construction and development works that affect the loss of shelter and habitat for bats.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and chemical treatment agents for some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, the wings are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a complex echo-location detection method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path. The result is the same.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the problem of winglets very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, check-ups of flappers and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only "Threave" reserve specifically for fins in Scotland, owned by Damfris and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten fin species found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this territory is ideally suited for slingshots.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a suitable habitat in general.
But there are still quite a few things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need for survival."
He stresses that it is important to check whether the wings do not stay in the appropriate place before carrying out the maintenance of the property, because it may happen that up to 400 mothers and their babies are killed due to the unwitting destruction of one mother's hiding place, thus possibly destroying the whole place.
Whips are protected animals and must not be killed, beaten, disturbed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, has called on the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for several of their species we just don't know how they fare."
Ronaldo Refuses to Complain in Rape, Delegating Lawyers to the Court of the German Journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has been condemned as "fake news" in the prosecution of the charges against him, saying that people "want to pay attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese-born and Turin-born "Juventus" football star is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid a woman $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, she told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after these claims were made by Ronald, 33, via Instagram online video addressed his 142 million followers, calling this information “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or award winner said on camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy person, and everything's fine," the player added.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to sue the Der Spiegel magazine over the allegations they have made, which they have called "inadmissible reporting on suspicions of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral harm to an extent commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years".
The incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino, a suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Clark County Court of Nevada, it is reported that after meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he sexually assaulted a woman.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on the road and said that he was "a 99 percent 'good boy'" but fell on this "one percent" temptation.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to accept the terms of this settlement, as the incident left a lasting trauma.
At the time the allegations were made, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he made a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million move to Italy's Juventus.
BREXIT: UK 'forever sorry' for loss of automakers
"The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if, after Brexit, it loses its position as the world's leader in car manufacturing," said Greg Clark, secretary of business.
They are "disturbed" by the fact that Toyota UK has told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production near the Burnastone plant in Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that delays at the borders in the case of Brexit could be put on the job without a deal.
The Burnastone plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union Member States.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a contract and how the intercity trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit, it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the automakers, the main concern is the supply chain at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "time-of-sight" principle, where custom-made cars are delivered to parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company "Toyota" it would not be possible to keep more than one day's worth of inventory in its D<0xC4><0x93>rbij<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>r factory, so we would have to stop production.
Mr Clarke said that the Withdrawal Plan (Chequers) drawn up by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The appeal to this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that rising costs in the long term would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately jeopardise jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and works as the union’s merger coordinator, said his members are feeling more and more anxiety: “From experience, I can say that as soon as a job goes away, it doesn’t come back.”
A government official said: "We have submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House reports
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “suspended for another week” as the battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Caveno’s running mate continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian election, the link between Trump’s funds and Russia, as well as possible non-compliance with the rule of law on the part of the president.
For months now, it has been rumored in Washington that Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and threaten Miller's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording the conversation with Trump and the possibility of leaving the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, where he shared his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "preferably" not release Rosemary, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing witnessed by both Caveno and one of the women who accused her of sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristine Bleij.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Caveno's allegations, continuing to delay the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders visited “Fox News Sunday.”
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are happening around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press informed about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The manager Chris Wallace asked, “Why?”
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to distaste for the TV reporter's "famous charades," though she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are famous charades."
After that, she proposed direct contact between Trump, which would increase the interest of the press.
"The president gets more questions and answers into the sessions than any president before him," she claimed, and without giving further details, moaned: "We're interested in the number of them."
Sanders claimed that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it's certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this, and you see that we've done it over the last few weeks, and it's going to happen in a place where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have demonstrated his reason this week in New York, devoting an uncontrollable and, at times, strange expression to the press.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff of Scottish NHS on Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working for the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish for the resilience of Brexit.
The MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of an agreement.
I know that this is a very restless time for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Kristen Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery
In Tennessee, the defender of the state of "Tigers" Kristen Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) underwent an emergency operation after a head injury, which he received on Saturday in a game in which the result was 31-27 awarded "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported the sports reporter "Tennessee" Mike Organs (Mike).
In Tennessee, the head coach of the state team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury was sustained not long ago.
"He came to the side line and said it collapsed," said Ridd.
While Abercrombie was on the sidelines, the coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put it on a stretcher and took him to further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told the WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that, for the time being, "there is no information about the type/heaviness of the injury," and the Tennessee State team is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after replacing Ilionis against the Tennessee state team.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he had made a total of five blocks, which in this season totaled 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the proceeds will be used to help homeless people under the new "Tory" plan.
Such a step will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased state tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The National Treasury estimates that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million can be collected annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state tax when buying property in the United Kingdom and diverting the proceeds to help homeless people, it will announce today Theresa May.
Such a move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at better prices and by addressing the wealthiest section of society.
The increased state tax will be applied to persons and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money raised by the government in its efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The surcharge included in the current state tax, including the application of a higher level of the fee introduced two years ago for the purchase and rental of a second home, could be as high as three percent.
The national treasury foresees that such a step can complement its budget of up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access their homes.
Many rich national territories, especially in the capital, have become "spooky cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state tax so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to tackle the UK housing problem.
Mr Corbyn has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including reforms on rent control and eviction from housing for no reason.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new housing.
Mrs Meyja said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore the dream of the United Kingdom - that every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means arranging our entrenched housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and organise their lives here.
However, it is not correct that housing can be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, its hard-working British population.
For many, the dream of their home has become too distant, and the problem of severe homelessness is still relevant."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the Northeast club, which currently takes third place in the first league with three points from the top.
This year, he moved to the Stadium of Light following the return of St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that was it," Ross told Scottish BBC's Sportsound.
"But I grew up with my father watching the Scotland game at Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be shown if I were successful in running the club."
Rosa's predecessors in the management of the Sunderland club are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guss Paulo Poijet, and Gus Canio Diet.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claims that he did not feel anxious following in the footsteps of such a large club recognized leaders, rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich in advance.
"My success will now be assessed on the basis of whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
“I’m not going to be able to do that,” he said.
"Returning the club to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I will probably believe that I will be successful here only when this task has been accomplished."
Ross is only in his driver’s career for the third year in a row, having previously worked as a deputy director in Dumbarton and spent a 15-month period in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped the club Alloa recover from a fall to the third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to win the championship.
Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They were probably the true crossroads," he recalls, assuming responsibility for Alloa.
“I really believed that management was my real calling — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I got good success, I was able to live from it and also enjoy certain heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it due to work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. It seems like I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good in my whole life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has caused the UK’s less popular pubs to falter, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The data collected revealed that in July, the sales of bars and pubs had increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents CGA, the business consulting agency that compiled the data, said: "Continuous sunny weather and England's prolonged participation in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e., the profit of the clubs was down8.
Restaurants, whose market share fell by 1.8 per cent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in the drinking clubs and bars was most appreciative, as they experienced much greater upswing than the restaurants experienced downswing.
The food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant staff felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend seen at the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events are the major factors that determine turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the additional ongoing cost pressure.
With regard to food suppliers, long and hot summers could not come at an even more inappropriate time, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperature we usually experience in August will provide the much-needed space."
Total sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decline in brand sales.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the UK’s sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from its 47 operating groups with a total turnover in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and this is an industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account, which it hides from its parents
The survey reveals that for every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, there is a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey, which included 20,000 high school students, revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said that they have the "main" account to show to parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, it was found that the number of fake profiles on the photo-sharing site Instagram is growing rapidly.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "pure main" account to show to parents, and alsodzan private accounts.
A mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders’ Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are building online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eileen Doyle will be a "facilitated voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
At the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors of Eilidh Doyle, he was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a director without executive power.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning indoor and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilids are being given tremendous respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community, and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will gain an immense amount by taking part in their reign," said Bytyj.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a 'lightweight voice' and I hope I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus winning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "On this day a month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time will tell whether and how much I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I can already do agility training!
Thank you for the inspirational words!"
Opinions are shared on the advertising of breast milk pump, which compares the mother with the cows
The breast milk pump manufacturing company has taken care of shared views online in connection with an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to cow’s milk.
To mark the release of the so-called "world's first silent breast pump" into circulation, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a sticky message ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cowhide to a song whose words sound like, "Yes, I've got a tail, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not tassels, they're my breasts."
The adverb continues: "Dry out, suck out, I feed the babies, suck out, suck out, I nurse my ladies."
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page has caused widespread online resonance.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and commented hundreds of times, has received mixed reviews from viewers, and many say it highlights the milk industry's "smiles".
"It's a very wrong decision to use cow product advertising.
Just like us, they, too, have to become difficult to produce milk and have to give birth, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump unobtrusively fits in the chest for lactating women (Elvie/Mother)
In another comment, it is stated: "I understand that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to promote breast milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "Advertisers did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that, in her opinion, the song was "concussive".
“I think that’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had breast-feeding.
Sucking out the milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment says: "It's a fun ad for moms who break down milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like 'goats'.
It is not an advertisement that glorifies or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discover that they all danced with inconspicuous pumps placed in their breasts.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who break milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the pump of the Elvie Pump is completely silent, it has no wires and pipes, and it is indiscriminately included in the bra designed for lactating women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in events outside the home.
Anna Balarina (Ana Balarin) Partner at Mother and Creative Director, commented: ""The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between women who break down milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milking, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and comprehensible way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
It is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the attention.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue in the sight of Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent town near Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border is relatively the same as before each month, and this has been partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policy implemented by the Trump administration, which has made it difficult for children to be accommodated by sponsors.
As a rule, the majority of sponsors were also undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that openly applying to take up a child would jeopardise their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior enforcement official for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors to unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had not been previously convicted.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these people are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute such people," said Mr Albensa.
According to the asylum staff, in an effort to speed up the examination of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules stipulating that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as foreseen by the previous standard.
Many will use the opportunity of a video conference call instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be deemed unfit for the purpose of obtaining the exemption will be promptly expelled.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, reported according to information provided by asylum workers and testimonies obtained from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have argued that these concerns will be exacerbated in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to the tent town without spending enough time on their emotional preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends could lead to injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupier armies" to immediately withdraw their forces
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s ongoing war is already in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "it will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must immediately and unconditionally step down," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", cleared of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops to Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem declared that the conditions were excellent for them to return, and blamed "single Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid to rebuild the country before an agreement on ending the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone based on the last dumping ground in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "is a fixed deadline", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the new committees soon, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, for the first meetings to draft the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualems set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the group's work would be limited to "revising the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, as long as, and on this, many liberal observers, impeachment and scandal may hope, do not put a stop to his presidency prematurely.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
At the moment, there is no evidence of the relaxation of the observers.
Since 2014, CNN’s ratings have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC’s ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers in its most popular broadcast, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is in the highest position in the cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers.
"It's a fire that attracts a lot of people, because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neil Baer, a supporter of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor". This drama tells the story of the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes the president after the attack is put out.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a theory of her own.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told her that I would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he's making me laugh,'" said Scovel's young lady.
The chaos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen to Rou v. Way, whether immigrant families will be able to merge, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it's more than being informed by a citizen at six o'clock to watch an expert group discuss how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort, and the $15,000-a-dove type of bomber.
I, for example, will never catch Super Mario again as before.
"Part of what he's doing that makes the reality show feel like, is that he's got you covered every day with information," Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Pawn Stars" explained about the Trump show's changing team and daily routines.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you’ll be late.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, the time for Kauai on the north coast was sunny, 80 degrees (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in rooms where, without blinking, he watched the MSNBC broadcast while recording CNN.
He was unable to disassociate himself, even when Brett Kavanaugh was due to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court threatens to unravel.
"I remember the days when we made all these crazy shows and when people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleisch told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from abroad flows into the pre-election campaigns of the strongest mid-term parliamentary elections
It is no wonder that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is seeking money thanks to the transformation of congressional districts, which will result in two existing MPs fighting for one seat.
This recently reformed Pittsburgh nomadic area is linked to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last spring in another area.
Lembs will fight another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were reworked.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to a struggle between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became well-known in Pennsylvania when he won by a small margin in the widely-observed March elections in the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts expect Democrats to have a slight predominance.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then reconsidered
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he stayed at a hotel in Panama until his partners walked out the door of the Trump organization’s management team.
Officials from the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", its department representative Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier in the day.
However, the penalties were only considered to apply to El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million euros from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include the reduction of financial assistance and the restriction of targeted visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and the number of murders have reached the highest levels.
During the internal meetings, the officials of North and Central America held a high-level conference, which focused on security and economic well-being, and which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which acknowledged the efforts of the US to prevent migration.
In mid-September, the country's top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending the arguments to punish El Salvador.
Diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to attend the planned conference in mid-October to show how serious the administration is emphasizing the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debate that was characterized by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to negotiate internally if their anonymity was maintained.
Their story was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity will be maintained.
Researching history
The second stone in the garden could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trump may have obstructed justice, which has a great deal of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the second party wins the upper hand in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this structure and possibly also to the jury of his fellow members at the very moment when he is already going to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of "but" and I am not saying that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen with his comrades in Europe.
There are choices that we will have to make for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and those choices will show the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German commanders were ready to take a turn against Hitler, as long as the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We get lost and miss the opportunity to avoid the years-long intoxication.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or impeded.
Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has faced difficulties since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly to record a conversation with the president and thought of his inadequacy for office.
Mr Rosenstein claims that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How can we respond if the newly requested FIB investigation of Bret Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And most importantly, will we vote in a midterm election for a Congress that will call Trump accountable?
If we do not pass all these tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
However, I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewess who was sent to Auschwitz by the very same Nazi regime that once roamed my embassy house.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabata candles on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

"Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about the fight with Vienna "Rapid"
The Rangers will take on Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the win over the Austrians after an impressive undisclosed game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League G group.
The road injury prevented centre forward Grem Dorans from returning to the playoffs until an undisclosed score of 2:2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this score as a springboard to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about that, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game believing that we would be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have achieved them in the end, but overall the result is an honest one.
They were probably better in the first half, but we played in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly difficult, but now we can see new coolness, which I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, to leave last season behind and to succeed."
Women are not able to sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the participants in the survey clearly knew what care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed this issue with family members.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study indicated that they do not talk to a spouse friend about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't do anything to pronounce it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your spouse friend and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known already well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for providing long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with the amount of money to cover these costs, or insurance using your assets — the main thing is for you to have the money.
Develop your own legal documents. Eliminate legal battles even before they have started.
Talk to your health representatives so that you are a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act according to your wishes if you are unable to express them to your own advantage.
Consider also the possibility of conferring powers on finances.
Choose a reliable person for making financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of the payment of your bills, if you can not do it yourself.
And do not forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency help.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you do not prepare.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who's a doctor," Martina said.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure you have a plan like this."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday killed at least 384 people. The number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to the damaged communications, rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala area, located north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379,800 people living there.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is an area that stretches for about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people lived in an area that is part of the province’s administrative region.
Fishing and farming are the economic backbone of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Donggal.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which regularly forms earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nia, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, in the south, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters high tsunami waves that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake near the earth's surface struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing damage and panic, as it reminded of the devastation brought on by the devastating 2004 earthquakes and tsunamis.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed in the burning buildings.
2018: severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peelin’s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Peelin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Peilins, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to call the police to report, as she claimed, the crimes that occurred, he took her phone.
Peilin has been detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and has been given $500 in security, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked whether he had pleaded guilty, he declared that he was "definitely not guilty".
Peilin has been charged with three Class A offenses, for which he can be sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, which can result in a day-long prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that charges of criminal offences have been brought against Peilin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Peilin.
His mother Sarah Peilina called the police and reported that there had been an attack.
This case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, she was accused of domestic violence, delaying the report on domestic violence and carrying a gun in a state of riot in connection with this incident.
His girlfriend claims that he punched her in the face with a fist.
In 2016, veterans’ groups criticized S<0xC4><0x81>ra Pe<0xC4><0xBC>ina for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, returning from service in Iraq.
Earthquakes caused by tsunamis in Indonesia: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake was triggered by a tsunami and has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social networks that show the moment of a collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in Palu, when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saifullo Saipov, who is being held on suspicion of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As alleged, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to launch an attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he shot down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a serious injury, as stated in the statement of intent to demand the death penalty, filed in the New York South District Court.
According to the court document, in the case of both these charges, the death penalty can be imposed.
Within weeks of the attack, the grand jury accepted an indictment of Saipov’s prosecution in 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder for extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organized crime cases, and also charges of non-trafficking.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditated intent", the prosecutors explained, noting that Saipov's attack was "awful, ruthless and inhumane".

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the prosecutors of the New York Southern District Court have carried out an indictment in a case in which the death penalty can be imposed.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in 2009.
The death penalty for the last time in the New York federal case was carried out in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death on charges of involvement in espionage for the first years of the Soviet Union.
The death penalty in the electric chair for a couple of Rosenbergs was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan for days and months, did not show any regret for the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he had also requested permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has denied 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "quite naturally unsatisfied" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty, not to accept the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release, will only prolong the ongoing injury caused to all parties involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
The Conservative MP announces that the conduct of the Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAID<0xC5><0xBD>EL FAR<0xC4><0x96><0xC5><0xBD>
During the protest, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" at a conservative conference today.
The former leader of Britain's Independent Party said politicians should be angry with eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have been a long way off if Mr Farage had been Minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge that Mrs Maya will have to face in trying to unite her opposing party has been demonstrated by conservatives who support remaining in the EU and joined a separate city-wide protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and feels the attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The Allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would make Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Bouna's "Leave Means Leave" at the Solihull rally announced that he wanted to throw May's plan into the manure (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make Mr Farage an ally and entrust him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the saying, we would have already gone," Bouns said.
A Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw away the fertile Mayan plan!"
Basing his opposition in the EU, he said: "We did not fight to be servants!
We want to make our own laws in our own country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the assumptions that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the citizens.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who are actually doing all the work and electing us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening to them."
In a message addressed to Mei, she added: "Prime Ministers remain in their place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally should feel the pressure if they are going to disobey the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and our politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to let the pressure of our politicians who are planning to hand over Brexit be felt.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never let go until we achieve that we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Palicians walked through Birmingham before a two-hour-long rally took place in the city centre.
Unbeknownst to activists, the Conservatives welcomed the Brexit banners after the group's weekend meeting.
Lord Adonis, a representative of the Workers’ Party, ridiculed the Conservatives on security issues they experienced with the party’s application at the start of the conference.
"These are people who claim to us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all of their technology for Canada and, yet, for an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about running for president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is "carefully considering" running for president of the United States after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the town hall of West Massachusetts.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November and running against GOP state Republican Geof Dill, who was Trump’s vice-president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who dares to run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using the town hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to run for president.
To which Warren replied that it was the right time for "Washington to have women who will "swap" the imperfect government, which also means women-presidents."
In the case of the shooting of LSU basketball player Simsa has been arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on suspicion of shooting a LSU basketball player in the Facey Sims case on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Daiteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for help in identifying the man seen.
Sims (20) was shot and killed near the student town of South University on Friday morning.
"The guy Sims was shot in the head, as a result of which he died immediately," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, via 247 Sports.
The way he managed to defend his friend and the Simpsons shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and admitted that he had shot Wayda Simsa.
Simpson was arrested without charge and he is in the East Baton Rouge Village Police Department.
6 feet 6 juniors, who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, gaining 5.6 points and kicking 2.9 rebounds in the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches world champion title after team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetela
From the moment when Walter Bottas qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton it became clear that the work of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
From the start, Bottas started well and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his place on the first two trips and invited Fetela to attack his teammate.
Fetel was the first to enter the garage and leave Hamilton behind to deal with the rest, which was probably the deciding factor.
The Mercedes driver filled the circle later and lag behind Fetela, but Hamilton continued to lead the way after a force-to-force ratio that saw the Ferrari driver incessantly leave the inside free, risking to lag behind after a double maneuver to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and at the end of the first round was seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that he was in charge of a large part of the race, because he focused on the tyres to quickly reach the finish and beat Kimi Raikonen in the fourth.
After all, he arrived in the garage in lap 44, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight laps, as Raikonen was fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump on Saturday at a rally mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her insistence not to release Christine Blaise Ford's letter, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak about Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but made a comment that what happened in the Senate showed that the people there were "bad, weird and unreliable."
"Something that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last few days in the Senate, when there is anger when you see angry, evil, ugly and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
- Atceries?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question...did you flush the document? — “Ah, ah, what did I do?”
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Do we do it... No, we didn't do it," he added, intoning the senators.
A letter was sent to Feinstein in July detailing what Ford is accusing Caveno of, and the contents of the letter were released in early September, but Feinstein denies that this had happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't "publish" her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not liked by the president, who commented on the situation at a rally on Saturday evening: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She probably didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whose three women are accused of sexual assault, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to their advantage.
"They are purposefully tuned to regain power by any means necessary."
If you see evil, discord, they don't care what pain they're in, what they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dvaiers threw two goals for Giants in the game against Dundee
"Dundee Stars" played on Friday's loss in the Elite League against the "Belfast Giants" winning Saturday's answers in the game with 5:3 Dundee.
"Giants" gained early dominance when Patrick Dvaiers and Francis Bovillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kovnye led the hosts before Two restored the dominance of the Giants.
The Frenchman Buhards leveled the score in favour of Dundee before the two words of Luke Lundwald Nielsen secured the team victory.
This was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the guys of Adam Kiefes, who won "Dundee" on Friday evening with 2 against 1.
It was the fourth team meeting of the season in which Giants had won the previous three games.
Two opened the game in the fourth minute, 3:35 receiving a pass from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford assisting Bovilliers doubled the score four minutes later.
After a tight start to the game, Sullivan led the hosts into the game at 13:10 before Mets Markvard pitched for Kovnyy to score a goal and equalize the score at 15:16.
Two convinced that the Giants are regaining control at the first opportunity when he won his second goal this evening in the first period under.
The hosts regrouped and Buhards again achieved a levelling result with the power goal in the 27:37 minute games.
Kovnyj and Charles Korkoran joined forces to help Nielsen put Dundee in charge for the first time during the second half of the game, and he also confidently scored in the final period to lead his team to victory.
"Giants", who have lost four of the five games, the next game will end on Friday, where at home will meet with "Milton Keynes".
The air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on the plane to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he sacrificed himself to get a plane with hundreds of passengers safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a powerful earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The territory will continue to experience strong afternoons and many are trapped in the muddy city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved his life, 21-year-old Antonius Ganav<0xC4><0x81>ns Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport control tower, which was shaking strongly.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower, thinking it might collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take her to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he adds.
Meanwhile, the state authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beautiful will grow, because many more people's bodies are under the rubble, and many cannot be accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reach a height of 6 meters, devastated Palu, where massive funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and the necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old young mother, Sky News said: "For a minute, the ambulance service is bringing in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops are everywhere overcrowded."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the state military convoy: "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was shaken by the earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini"says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which the plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has disappeared, although before that it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
The airline "Air Niugini" announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not answer for one of the passengers - a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local residents by boat helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six people remained in the hospital until Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane crashed into the lagoon shortly after takeoff from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway was overestimated on the plane.
The American passenger, Bill Jains, said the plane was very low.
"It was really good," said Jens.
Jens says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using the emergency exit, as the water was only up to the waist.
He said that he panicked and screamed, and that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship's dock also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years, none associated with "Air Niugini".
Psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events on the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday provided evidence repeatedly in the case under investigation, where a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlets, a psychoanalyst from the US Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the defendants how he used the information obtained from the phone to piece together how the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old inmate Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rovlets said he received location data from several phones that showed Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contesting his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers’s, at the time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another mishap was that Telis said he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovlets said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted the text messages, calls and contact information he received from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Heil.
The defence is expected to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the swearing-in later that same day.
Group "The High Breed": What is conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative views of this genre of music, with their music giving a positive message.
The High Breed, from Bristol, alleges that hip-hop has deviated from its origins on messages of a political nature and those dealing with problems of a social nature.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, the nanny complained over the dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York, the nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an erroneous text message from her mother, who complained that the nanny was "again black."
The couple denies that they are racists, likening the court case to "expelling".
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her distasteful attitude when she learned that the new baby-sitter, Gisele Mauris, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"WARNING, WITHOUT BLACK," Plasko-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, in addition, twice.
Confronting her awkwardness, Plasco-Flaxman's "selfish" dismissal of Maurice, stating that her previous babysitter, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for a Filipino, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one working day and sent her home with Uber.
Now Mauris has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with secured housing, which she originally applied for, in addition to without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected accusations that they were racists, claiming that the termination of Maurice's employment was a sensible decision, because they feared that after her insult they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasko, a husband, told the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you have treated rudely, even if it was just because of a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Similar to the "expelling" of the court hearing, Plasko said that his wife had given birth to a baby only two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"You're really turning against someone like that?
This is not an acceptable action," the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are still taking place, public opinions are quickly courted across social networks, denouncing them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington book were worried that readers would not be able to associate with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It is very surprising now to learn what we know about Padington's great achievements."
Telling that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweetly bitter" after his father's passing.
Speaking of Padington, whom she calls "a very important member of the family," her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and he wasn't great," she said.
"But because Padington was so real to him, it was like having a kid who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Padington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Nedd called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she would not survive," Ednana-Laperuza said.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even faster and it all ended now.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cheer or yell because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
It took me a lot of strength to master it.”
After all, in the midst of the loss of her daughter, Ednana-Laperuza boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I shook my head and cried all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Snoring women attach cards to the bridges to prevent suicides
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, act to help others not to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey reinforce the cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
David’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lidonia, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him with a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lit up" always and everywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have consequences."
Davis created the cards, "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit quietly, you have to talk.”
Humphrey, who has been a friend of David’s for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say that I would feel sad or depressed or that I would feel any quote,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the kids opened presents he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
His death was a great trauma to the children, but they have to deal with it: "It saddens the whole family.
It separates us.
But we all have to keep going and fight."

The future of Breta Caveno hangs in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for — in a time and volume-limited investigation — we might be able to reach a little consensus," Fleiks said Saturday, adding that he was concerned the commission was "sharing" between hardened partisans.
Why don’t Kaveno and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstinence is just a coincidence.
The midterm elections are in five weeks, on 6 November — if, as is expected, the Republicans go bad, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among them in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 seats belong to the Republicans, and 49 to the Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to rule on the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has "decreased" the number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Mergers, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2011, when their number was 2,706.
Parks said stricter border controls on North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea end up being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deports them by coercive means.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation talks.
This came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when, on major trains, they agreed to cooperate to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since those talks.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Caveno "hysterical" and claims he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Court Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Breta Caveno a "hysterical" and claimed he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Caveno's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Caveno emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault to Dr. Kristina Bleazie Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling him an accused of "grotesque and concerted destruction of character" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Caveno's testimony is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a two-sided attitude toward the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such allegations and the attitude with which he is addressing the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to question Caveno if she was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in an existing workplace in court,” Pelosi said.
Caveno is currently a judge in the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possibility of Caveno taking decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way, because she was seen as a conservative judge.
In his confirmation talks, Caveno was scrutinized as to whether he would reject Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical and double-minded person to work in court, but we would be happy to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
But women have to hold hands.
It is a denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "a pair of edges", but she is not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something you don't like?"
She continued, "Once I was helped by a woman who was a manager at a company, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but created a technique — when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm sad.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to go.
And I thought it was great."
The type of discharge of tears as anger is only partially recognized, because they are misunderstandings on the very basis.
One of my most vivid memories is of the earlier work, in which the proportion of men was expressed, when I once cried out inexpressible anger, when behind me a woman of a sorrowful parent grabbed me — a repulsive leader (woman), from whom I was always a little afraid, who carried me to the tent.
"Never let them see that cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you've been transferred.
They think you're sad, and they'll just be glad you managed to get under your skin."
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart to pre-elect him as campaign president.
In 1987, when Hart, who had been caught out of wedlock, left the ship, also known as the "fooling", and resigned from the election, Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to raise was another one.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She was late for the campaign, she delayed fundraising and promised not to participate in the election unless $2 million was raised.
It was a lost battle.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to male representatives, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in the system that made it very difficult to raise funds and speak to voters rather than delegates, and angry about the sexism — in which she was “sniffed.”
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they would write on my coat.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Favorable for Beijing
The main justifications for how the trade war between the US and China has started are hidden and as long as the fighting does not see an end, disagreements between the countries may be favorable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing a tax on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the unit’s $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value, immediately imposing half of the goods being exported to the U.S. from China.
Beijing also responds "welcome" each time, the latest being a five to ten percent rate for $ 60 billion worth of American goods.
China has said it is committed to responding to the U.S. one-on-one, and it is doubtful that the world's second-largest economy could shrink in the near future.
For Washington to step down, it would have to agree to certain demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards out correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the economies of the two countries with each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision has been taken either in Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are indeed more dangerous than previously recognized by observers," said Abigail Greis, a New American Security researcher who focuses on surveillance.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to take refugees back voluntarily and calls for help to restore the country that has been at war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"At the moment, the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Almualems said that the Syrian regime would accept help in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
The European golf team sensationally wins the Raider Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup by beating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost in Europe six times in a row and has not won a Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by Denmark's Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which was needed to beat the US.
US star Phil Mikelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw his T-shirt into the water at the 16th hole of PAR 3, stepping into the match of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of four players who have ever managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament is played according to the existing format.
The American Jordan Spitt lost 5 to 4 sensationally to European teams, according to the rating of the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, who probably had the last Raider Cup.
A veteran of the Eighth Raider Cup, Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't bear tears."
This was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he raised me and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy that we've got the cup back.
It's a team merit and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia commented emotionally after the European Championship victory.
He then gives the name to his daughter, John Ram, who won the US golf legend Taiger Woods 2-1 on Sunday.
"The pride I feel in winning the Taigeru Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raider Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being second to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their chances, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furrick, after his team's unsatisfactory performance, said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This was the moment when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We were fighting.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players led a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raider Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to put on your hats.
We won."
Latest news on the red flag: Concentration decreases in Pinell (Pinella), Manatee (Manatee) and Sarasota (Sarasota)
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee (FWC) points to an overall reduction in redness concentration in part of the Tampa Bay area.
In accordance with the FWC, spotting has been reported in Pinell, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentration.
Red spruce blooms extend about 130 miles from the North Pole to the southern shoreline of the area.
Spots are found about 10 miles from the seashore area of the Hillsborough area, but in some places last about a week.
The red elevation is also appreciated in the Pasko area.
Last week, an average concentration was reported in the Pinela area or its coastal zone, a low-to-high concentration in the coastal zone of the Hilsboro area, a small-to-high concentration in the Manati area, a small-to-high concentration in the Sarasota area or its coastal zone, or a low-to-high concentration in the coastal zone of the Lessor.
Inflammation of the respiratory system is still reported in the areas of Pinela, Manaty, Sarasota, Lee and Collie.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
