Populist right-wing triumph in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a noticeable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, so it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst, literally catastrophic, results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results were heard speculations about the resignation of the president of the party and, to this day, Vice-Chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved as early as Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the election results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same year 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO) was a year for the BZ's unity, but the BZ's was a year for the BZ's.
For this evolution, Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be achieved, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
“If this is not resolved then yes, then yes it would surely come to this cooling,” he noted after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get into legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
He can then request the release of the case and await the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person “legally competent support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I'm approaching an electronic wall map, it depicts Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the exposition and sometimes the complete one.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the firm ground
The countries with coasts have today started to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called continental edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the continental border resources.
"Simply put, the continental edge means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches to the limit of the sea coast, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental edge, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist help committee.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime dominance.
However, New Zealand also achieved this - the seabed area granted to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars for their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental edge ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as "the common heritage of humanity".
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is no gold mine,” says director Mikulka emphatically adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed to other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the capability to operate in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion sites containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the German command of special forces was at the scene of action.
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt are becoming known.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Therefore, at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the Federal police aircraft squadron, the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charitable institution.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the ground.
"Fortunately, that time didn't come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first U.S. Congressional chamber has narrowly failed a major $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones has fallen dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 against the government’s bailout package.
Despite all the appeals of President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, it did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked MPs to cast a vote even though the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t absolutely happened yet,” he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
To allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers report increased number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research from the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed about reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The favorite destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Spa, the beer in jars of a liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, the TV host and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in a tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seem to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets rare looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A nun draws my attention to my apron that I had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widowed."
Oh, God, now I'm hugging from behind to the left.
"All right," he says laughing.
The others don’t care much about the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistically is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after I put aside his glass of a liter of beer that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
Others aren’t very lucky and can’t consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, health care groups run to the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered swings from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: sober people come, drunk people come back.
It is not seen who suffers from alcoholemia degrees and is in the aisles.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’ a health care provider gave me the answer to my question and disappeared into turmoil.
Victim of accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood City, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Its Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers longed to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps inland from Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that’s what the guides say.
The building is positioned at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office is over, there’s no doubt about the company’s greatness that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a “latecomer” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that healed as far as Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has fallen apart and remained on the fringes of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shocks, which produced the cadence of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
That has raised some suspicions in the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits -- men and women -- meet early in the morning to settle/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both.
“But surely at some point,” I ask, “could Turkey be forced to choose?”
"Turkey," he replies, "doesn't want to defy that choice."
Then it highlights a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had almost recited to me from memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States of America as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts return to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (esque, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing our 20s – we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the shape-shifting mythological being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this young choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
Its wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxed, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical shard, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – otherwise, many times I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known war horses around the world."
We will miss you very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff’s author in Beyond Nab End, but is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950–51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda's Oversold
In November, Honda will begin commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a large habitability, this new monovolume presents an even wider interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters in length - that the Japanese company expects to market close to 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz is growing at all levels.
Its length goes up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also increases.
This gain is due, on the one hand to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with the engine 1.4, since the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-litre engine achieves 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which in the past Jazz reached 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car That Prevents Collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important are the bee’s compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object, and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or higher to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require storing information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about memory gigs, not even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Temporarily before taking a mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a pleasant and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
In other words, the Hotel of bad credit... or of trouble.
The tricky aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market share.
A week after discovering an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a price per unit of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible bonds, ensuring a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global transaction would be based on a unit price of $29, or 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
Modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that the participation would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have greatly eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were grueling for the group, which saw its stock price halve while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost declined last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s big investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers bankruptcies and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, estimating it to be between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held calmly, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the State ' s power over the economy, reserving to it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through currencies that send their emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they have been unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said the official, who remained anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flashlight" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and by members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and two were detained.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letras - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to restoring only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with looking into history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is these who are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Head of Economic Competence.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves for more than a year, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will surely sell a part of its business, including especially the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3>.
The shares of Fortis began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow it to break.
The company's shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The management of the Bank blamed the sharp fall in the shares of Fortis on the insecurities of the US market in connection with the approval of the US $ 700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also looked for private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when looking at drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the recipe data in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
The same should be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the program of monitoring medical prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the health status of the customer and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Previously, they sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the identification number of the client easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and state of health of the client.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some drugs are multipurpose, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, require the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not been fined for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data they get more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So that the hens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other largely global issues, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to focus on nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President José Manuel Barroso, Commission President, and Javier Solana, India’s prime minister, welcomed Manmohan Singh, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the European Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi only ranks ninth among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit focused its attention on global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of terrorism – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20%.
India also agrees with this, just as next year’s climate conference is expected to reach a global agreement and cut greenhouse gas production by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt

There will be a meeting with the press in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane was found a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on an plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Nevada mountain range of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
"The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is the very thing that Steve Fossett was flying about on the day of his disappearance," Anderson said at a news conference.
The police said no human remains were found on the plane or in the area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) has announced that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of investigators has been dispatched that has identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing Fossett’s name, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour in a balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had circled the world by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also for having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An off-scheme SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the SUV Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Ellumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
With this formula will be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they’d never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the militants’ city of origin appears: Saturday night they have been pulled out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the actions coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents the attendance of not only Italian stadiums but also those from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Lucky for you!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the interior ministry said.
Therefore, "well-open eyes" especially in view of Wednesday's National match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also count on a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was previously of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste’s head of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - adds the Observatory no. 1 - the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: these too are not a crime, but if they allow, they are not of education either...”.
