In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hangings had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoy, in the place of his residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide through hanging.
It is known that he has already made suicide attempts.
What caused the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at the place of residence, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died by hanging.
Signs of violent death have not been found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
Do you have a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find the money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are starting to see the solution in a small black box neatly arranged on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile traveled by a motorist and pass this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system, undertaken by Washington and state planning bodies.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning unexpectedly gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and even perhaps where you travel them — and then use that information when drawing up tax accounts.
Tea-drinking movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding privacy.
And while Congress can’t yet agree whether to continue or not, several states aren’t going to wait.
They’re thinking about how over the next decade it’s possible to move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It’s not a question we can have a choice on,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state’s miles traveled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for this already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for Highway Construction, funded by taxes that Americans pay on gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply impossible to keep,” said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
Borrowing is called a bad user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the load of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning authorities in California are looking at this system in the course of developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, House Rep. Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market supporters at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to have drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that’s going to go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason’s vice president of policy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a fair payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go this route on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of mileage instead of gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they will be able to make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
“Worrying about ‘big brother’ and things like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were in full swing, the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where the search for low-cost technology is going on, which would allow state authorities to count the miles traveled by car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not involved in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of the type of auto insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded using a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a few big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are keen to develop a taxing device that will also charge parking meters, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automotiveists will be attracted to the participation of the benefits that will be offered to them,” the city planning document says.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering if all the talk of making a payment is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for Highway Construction by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take aspirin,” Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations, said in a statement.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to reach an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of funding.
It does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one degree - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU officials say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
“Negotiations are being held between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world’s megacities since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their redevelopment and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
There is a well-known example of Singapore, where a strict quota has been introduced for the increase in the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, where entry is allowed only for cars with a certain eco-class, also using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunsheng, director of the transport pollution control department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to the level of not more than 6 million vehicles (now 5.2 million), and also increase the use of more than one vehicle.
According to the agency, now motor transport in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year" include the development of an accelerated compared with the rest of the country of the electric vehicle transition to the euro standards of fuel, the introduction of the local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (except for the creation of old vehicles).
The number of car innovations in Beijing also includes a ban for all private cars to move within the fifth ring of traffic (only in the capital of China, the number of cars is six) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration marks for cars on the basis of the lottery (in the first year, the number of cars in the second year, the number of cars in the third year).
According to the current state program "Environmental protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, “moving sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips - a matter that is notoriously unpopular, they can be adopted by society only on the condition of their complete universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - business and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand. (about 5% of the total number of cars).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential construction, the area of road coverage and the amount of road transport.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice less than required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in the parking lot or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking lots, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the traffic part (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the security zone of the historic center (the total area of about 3212 hectares, covering the city center).
Fines for unauthorized street traffic in Vologda will increase in times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of the fines will help to bring order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not undergo adequate sanitary control.
This means that the health of the humidifier is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, according to the press service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely conditioned by consumption, which almost does not slow down the turnover, "said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so most likely, they will be engaged in the optimization of personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - by only 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
The companies have been faced with a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business can not raise wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees away from the side or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia of podder is alive and very fast growth of demand credit.
According to Mr. Graf, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of demand lending, the money is not spent on the economy, but returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is another - at Goldman Sachs expect an increase in overdue on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned,” said Mr Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, director of the HSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources that state banks have, were forced to attract public funds at high interest rates.
In response, state banks went on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state banks do not give up dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
Deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with such a situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, believe the investment bank, - due to the refusal to index salaries of civil servants and military, laid in the current version of the draft budget.
Partly the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing tariffs on natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by lowering inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisite for this is not yet - see the certificate), the growth of consumption will still slow down, I am sure at Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still falling oil prices,” he says.
According to him, the economy of Russia will begin to decline at the cost of oil below $ 90 / bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen, and banks have started to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Grafe said.
The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect, only affects the rates of interbank lending.
“For the Central Bank, this is a collapse of all hope,” said Clemens Grafe.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks use not to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, this means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,” Grafe said, recalling that the state plans to release the ruble in “free swimming” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble rate is now artificially exceeded by 10%.
There is only one way to lose weight, the expert concludes.
But if the central bank plunges into financiers, even if the shadow of doubt is that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
In Chelyabinsk, the Second Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
Here we can set an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no disagreements or disagreements.
We live in full mutual understanding,” says Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result, the Congress passed a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of opera and ballet.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that give no protection.”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads the parliamentary group that oversees the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him and destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, Member of Parliament for the Green Party of Germany, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele said that, according to a lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “safe,” the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the world’s response to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — have found the disclosure of an unchecked system of pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would pay only if they found themselves at the exit for boarding.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should force passengers to take care of payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for that,” she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second bags delivered to baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges are stuffing as much as they can in hand luggage placed in the upper baggage compartments, which is why there is often a lack of space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to spend less on board.
O'Malley said that this new levy is not really for the purpose of making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that finding a place in the top luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the departure of the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures on the Frontier website and at the Frontier check-in counters was intended to ensure that passengers would be aware of the fare before they got to boarding.
The new Frontier manual storage fee will not begin to be charged until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage fees a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not relate to manual storage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual baggage claim three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
According to his estimate in a December 2011 report, the manual deposit fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was curious to find out what he would find on the way out when passengers encountered the unusual Spirit hand luggage collection.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my career with airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth scraping and a fight at the exit to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire bank and that coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to provide water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but declined to do so after seven months, after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than turning to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began giving twice as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the miles traveled.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loser.
Revenue declined 9 percent and flight capabilities declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames "internal error" and not hackers in the termination of the site
The undercover National Security Agency said Friday evening that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, a representative of the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network was “not at all” hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of activist hackers said it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA’s website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the NSA’s super-secret agent, once nicknamed “No Such Agency,” has been at the center of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and within the country — all a reaction to the NSA’s secret files stolen and stolen from the agent.
The growing controversy around the agency has prompted speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier's profit declines with drop in deliveries and number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, said on Thursday it was reducing net profit by 15 per cent as a result of the reduced number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial service by next September would be implemented.
After the first test flight of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results did not justify the forecasts and led to a fall in shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday downgraded his valuation from “over-medium” to “medium” because of the belief that stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transport department’s profit indicators,” Doerxen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and made its first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not yet too many – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify the company’s claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Bodouan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Bodouan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the time of the downing of the aircraft.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to make the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is expected to make a flight in the coming weeks and all others will follow soon, the company said.
And yet analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is estimating the time of commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – though apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that commissioning will be carried forward to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace department’s order portfolio stood at $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” Bodwan said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector had risen nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure from December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Picchett will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 at auction in mid-Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, said on Thursday it was cutting quarterly revenue by 10 percent.
Sony Expects Lower Annual Profits
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, having completed the previous quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced its forecast for profit for the current financial year.
Sony’s results for the period July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected due to a drop in demand for TVs, camcorders and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company's first operating profit in three years of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
Japan’s consumer electronics market is going through a tough time, especially as demand for televisions is declining.
And while competitors seek a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure will be significantly higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of sales of "smart" watches from a Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will allow you to get rid of the need to deliver a smartphone 100 times a day from your pocket.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and earnings forecast, the company's shares at the opening of the torogos in Tokyo in the morning lost more than 11%, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The gene of speech turned out to be a stimulant of the formation of synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein through which the “speech gene” Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have been affected by the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least some of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with speech formation.
This is due to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 citing its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 does affect vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in a mouse experiment.
When the animals’ gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds was also restored.
Previously, the mice were also shown the connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were given a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, managed by SRPX2 is associated with purely "mechanical" sound-forming properties or more subtle processes.
A Cocaine Addiction Lawyer Who Warned the Head of a Criminal Group About a Police Investigation Is Jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditt transferred information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditt gave the criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information about the investigation of his activities on drug trafficking after being threatened due to his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer nicknamed Bash and dubbed a “cool lawyer” among the criminals, he was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to track Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed Scarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a lawyer’s association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was “regularly using” a Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta passed the information to the criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today in the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditt, who works at the legal firm Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, was covered with shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to cocaine possession at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer’s disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough’s activities found that he had been talking to Ditt on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found him approaching Ditt’s home in Blackburn and placing 60 percent-purity drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditt, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers' Iwood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home after the drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta had “regularly used” cocaine after tests found traces of the drug class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, he was also taken a hair sample.
In an interview with the police, he said that along with the workplace, he also had a home office, and clients came to his home for legal matters.
However, it became known to the court that after important arrests he had called the largest participants in the illegal drug trade, a number of which he had previously represented in court, to tell what the detectives knew about them.
In an indictment, Ann White said, “If anyone knows that the law should not be broken, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely gone beyond the normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but shamed it.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed himself to doubt his disinterestedness.
“If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not and would like to pass on the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Lancashire Police Senior Officer Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer into a criminal as soon as he began to acquire drugs from organized crime representatives.”
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the goals of the main actors in criminal groups, who had instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide his profession.
Mr. Ditt's case has been investigated by Lancashire's Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already convicted him of three cases of cocaine possession, and now also of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to achieving a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the machinations were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him over dinner is Muhammad Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready for the reception of 22 thousand spectators, said police officers who were present today at the meeting of the KDC of the Russian Federation.
The ticket program is, in their opinion, about twice as high.
During the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia with Spartak was used only a thousand stewards at the regulatory rate of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were given 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDK Arthur Grigoryants.
The U.S. has been listening to senior Japanese officials.
On Friday, Nov. 1, a U.S. intelligence official who chose not to disclose his name said the U.S. had been wiretapped by senior Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this was during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for intelligence activities, the NHK TV channel reported.
Officially, none of the parties have commented on this information yet.
Recall that the news about the surveillance of the US special services for the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her audition very painfully.
She said that the allies, which, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about Angela Merkel’s wiretapping with employees of the German prosecutor’s office.
The German flew specifically to Moscow to meet with a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria can put grain on the market no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain on the market no earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and there is demand.
"Possibly the grain will be put up for auction, after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, the crops of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550,000 hectares (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012) were planted during the 2014 harvest.
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, the rye has remained at the previous level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brother Circle", to which in the United States was assigned Leps
In the databases of Russian security forces of the group “Brother Circle”, to which Washington attributed the singer Grigory Leps, is not significant.
As noted by “Interfax” in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation, after the media reports about the introduction of the U.S. Treasury Grigory Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brother Circle”, all databases were checked, but such a group was not.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, believe in the power structures.
"Even in the very name - 'Brotherly Circle', there is an element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a PR action," the agency's interlocutor said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced the inclusion of Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky, and Igor I in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brother Circle”.
The individuals on this list are suspected of links to some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps “serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
In the production center Grigory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "crazy".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama named the Fraternal Circle trade union among “substantial transnational organized crime groups” and charged the minfina with “undermining and banning their global criminal operations.”
The inclusion of a person in the blacklists of the American Muffin entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him people living in the United States.
A scandalous video was sent to the police.
Toronto boss Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless outbursts, was caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had a videotape and were ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford’s drug use appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but that he was responsible for its existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-narcotics raid conducted by law enforcement in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video was already written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He just says it's not his fault and he's not going to resign.
The video, found by police, is one of the evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes, Lilly was the driver of Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken manner, allowed himself to make racist and sexist statements.

Turkish Politician Announces Hunger Strike Against Wall on Border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of a partition wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin Aishe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, has declared a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a partition wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly staged protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Guler first denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybin, Ayshe Hekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party said in a statement.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree with,” Ayesha Hekhan said.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of a partition wall is planned in Nusaybin.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by the Bloomberg agency with reference to the government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be established later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President of Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing the prices of consumer products and goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Ugra Andrei Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergey Shepelev.
"The resignation came just a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready," Belmach told ITAR-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by media provocation law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said the new media court would “always be biased as it is a continuation of the government,” and content and advertising restrictions would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media by a dead hand,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “taken a serious hit” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance camera footage of troops being sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo’s reaction was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", i.e. getting a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender’s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “enlivened blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to shut up, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of restraining and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts appointed by the National Wage Commission and restore the size of their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
In the communal payments of the Voronezh people there will be a new line of expenses - deductions for the overhaul of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact regulations will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order the stairwells or even replace the elevator - the residents will decide for themselves.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, we need to put a lot of funds in order - to establish the order of the preparation of houses, to accumulate funds in non-managing companies - which we often register in Moscow, Orenburg, somewhere else, it will be over the state control.
Under the control of the state, it is now part-building.
The law, which protects against fraudsters, is approved by the Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all participants of share construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this sphere, abuses have also started, related to the fact that in 98 the shareholders got the same, and in 2000-ies the same shareholders."
People started making money on it to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens to be deported.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region are at least remedied.
So, last year, a little more than 100,000 foreigners were registered for migration.
However, only one in five has an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There are no ships, and we have to deport them - we have to keep them somewhere.
Such a decision was made by the Federation that at the expense of regional funds to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - it is the Old Olshanka Semiluk district.
Well, and finally, the regional parliament has granted new privileges to many children's parents.
First, families where 5 or more children are brought up are exempt from the transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million - but the same is saved by many parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will issue subsidies for housing.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, their own child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or South-West microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the garden center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.

The goalkeeper of "Neftekhimika" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of the Nizhnekamets.
Golkiper believes that acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority from the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall, today "Neftekhimik" sent Krikunova to resign.

U.S. Secretary of State: U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that when collecting data and wiretapping, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far,” however, the politician noted that the information about wiretapping appeared in the media of 70 million people does not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed during this process, but an attempt was made to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was of an irregular nature.
I recognize this, as the president acknowledges... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future,” he said.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italy's unemployment is breaking records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s residents are now unemployed.
Things have not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 have no employment.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the country’s largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for workers with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is facing an ageing population problem common to Europe.
And economists are not sure that an undertaking with premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
What will lead to the construction of the TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and transfer units (TPUs).
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was built near the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the transport and transfer center is being set up.
All this was very strange, because near "Smolenskaya" no land transport stops and, therefore, it is not possible to move to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground passage through the Karmanitsky lane.
Smolensk is almost finished.
The flower larch disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced with a cartilage.
Here's the whole transport node.
Transport and transfer hubs are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the capital's transport department.
There is no capital TPU yet.
And flats involve the construction of parking lots, the removal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
Actually, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transporters, but professional beautifiers from the department of overhaul of the city of Moscow.
The transport node is not necessarily a complicated design, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes there are enough roofs above the head and a sign to warn about the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, at the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a completely full-fledged flat transfer node.
Let it be without curtains, but with interlocking parking spaces and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number, officials record everything in the TPU.
As early as 2011, the city planned to build all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020, there are 255 TPUs.
One-and-a-half of them are expected to return later this year.
Although the city has a TPU development program, no quality criteria are specified, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
They are reported by the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly, a reduction in the time of transplantation, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the type of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, the TPU sometimes comes out exactly the opposite.
A bright example of metro "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square before the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonautov street.
Farthest from the metro, farthest from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
The gift that the residents absolutely did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
The capital of the TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately ask.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the metro "Planernaya".
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And there really is a pattern of how a transplant node, given to investors for a ransom, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are railings for buses, a shed not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
However, the Chemkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU did not give place in principle.
They were moved away from the subway like strangers.
But there are more places to trade.
Only one clothes 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from zoo products to the car show.
In fact, suddenly who of the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason there is always a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a boycott trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, looking at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that before the subway "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture of merchants regretted and allowed to the intercepting parking of the transplant center.
However, due to the high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was taken down in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's the tipping point.
At the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance of the approach from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to walk around it under the open sky.
However, the constructions on the "Planerna" and "Kaluga" will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the town planning and land commission of the town hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow at the metro "Tushino", it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told journalists: in the future multi-storeys will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-storey parking lots mutate from a third to a half of the area.
Take, for example, the “people’s” garages.
Let’s say that the garage with 258 parking spaces, which was recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars at "Petrovsk-Razumovsk" will need about 80 thousand "squares".
That's less than a third of the car they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go on all sorts of platforms for buses.
There is at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And that's, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railways, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities,” including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for the TPU to officials directly.
Without any contests.
Because, he says, transportation issues for the city are a priority.
The perfect TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadaina station in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleybuses and trams go underground to the metro level and the approach distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no over-trade.
But Moscow officials are throwing in the extreme.
Either we don't build anything, or we're going to demolish 25 floors of offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate to extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to punish for this for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be affected by the insult of state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, has not been worked out enough in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the annual Victory Day debates, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - annually unfolds a real wakhanalia.
Exercising in wit and an “alternative view” of history, some publicists come to the argument that, to say, how sad that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual stronghold" of the nation," - outraged Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotically-minded people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and to insult patriotic feelings can be almost without punishment.
In the opinion of the elected representative, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe in article 282 of the Criminal Code the corresponding punishment.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to a 5-year prison sentence.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The quake's focus was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
Nothing has been reported about the victims or the destruction caused by the subterranean push.
Chile is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of different forces are not uncommon there.
One of the most significant events happened in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, a magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than five thousand people were killed.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained activists, Greenpeace is a citizen of France.
Piero Pisano, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detained citizen,” Mr. Ero told RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Medvedev said.
According to him, the activity of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the production of energy carriers, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "like a powder keg", and reminded about what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN Announces New Targets to Overcome Poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that it was time to “become above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals – the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the powers vested in me by member countries to implement our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on successful implementation of the MDGs.
Mozambique’s security concerns are growing as a result of conflict among influential people
Under the top-down statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want the world to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a t-shirt decorated with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the armistice more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to shrink back to full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy as the opening of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as an investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government has become the custodian of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group’s leader, Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking a soldier.
President Armando Gebuz tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt he was a “failure” to use “all that remains of his power to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo's resignation from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease the tensions that have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have faced the brow,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to secure concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former member Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuz, who was due to step down next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the capabilities of Renault are, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroads for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has exacerbated discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent kidnapping of people, said Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who has to find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want the renewal of the world, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
A series of premieres of "Art-Mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of “Art Mainstream” screenings, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the Rolan cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports, citing the organizers of the project.
The program "Art-mainstream" will be opened by the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital, Maya (Sam Kerichi), who is deported to Morocco because of problems with the visa.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also show viewers a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-Duk "Mebius." Melodramatic Baiopik Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: the story of love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film passed in the maestro "Kiwengo"
The only Russian participant of the "Art Mainstream" will be the winner at the "Kinotavr" festival of Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geographer of the Globe Spilled" based on the novel of the same name by Alexey Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Victor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavra".
Children should study myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
Narratives of the Torah could show that “a brute force cannot defeat a subtle trick,” and legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates a “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favor of introducing them to the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “refuses interest” in children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote a "Collection of Norse Myths" for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
In Voronezh region detained football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening of October 29 at the station Gryazi-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way made a drunken deboss on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty station of the linear police station at Gryazy for the preparation of the protocol on administrative offense.
There the fans repented in their anti-social behavior.
The police seized the administrative material and released it.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for its arrival.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door in the station waiting room with his foot.
An officer of the transport police and a guard of the Russian Railways (RZD) CDP rushed to the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to detain the attacker, who was trying to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern University of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are being checked.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being addressed, said Sergey Olkhovik, Senior Referrer for the Direction of Information and Public Relations of the South-Eastern Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on Transport.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaliy Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Schinnik" - "Spartak".
I am in favor of the organizers of sports events being responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFS.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone to come along and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not quite the right one.
We need to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let the case to self-run.
We have now developed a special government regulation on stadium rules of conduct.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this problem closely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, let the law speed up.
The feeling that it is the fans of "Bavaria" in Yaroslavl came and arranged it all.
We are outside observers.
And it's terrible to see the tribune being poured out of the fire pit.
This is a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we came back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside of Russia to testify on the wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone talks.
According to an Interfax source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions of representatives of the German Prosecutor General’s Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
“In this case, it will lose refugee status and can be handed over to Washington by U.S.-allied countries,” the source said.
“At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Federal Republic of Germany could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or forward written questions to Snowden,” the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the US intelligence services of the negotiations of the Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify before the German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
An ex-CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
For this, however, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival,” Strebel told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on a statement from an Interfax source, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about the secret operations of U.S. intelligence services on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was canceled by the U.S. authorities, who inadvertently accused him of serious charges, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day left "Sheremetyevo".
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client was hired to work for a "large Russian company".
The NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by the German media.
According to journalists, the US began to listen to the Chancellor’s telephone conversations back in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after the publication of this information, said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left "Just Russia"
Deputy of the State Duma from the Just Russia party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted a statement on the withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted a statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the “Spraedrosov”.
We sit down, we drink tea...
“For some reason, many people want to see the painting “Ilya Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table”, but there is nothing so epochal about it,” the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the “Essers”.
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev, Deputy of the State Duma, does not intend to refuse the mandate.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and can not legally leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the Just Russia party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valeriy Zubov will leave the SR together with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty,” he said at a meeting.
Japan’s Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral in nature.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will go to Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
There are cars driving through the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level does not exceed.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the stand-up artist Frank Fay, who worked in a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fei’s innovation over time has been embraced by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“The majority of these headliners started at Carolines and then went on to achieve greater success, to a level where they are already too famous to perform at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Mara, as well as Standup for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Ruth, and others will appear.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example, thanks to shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame for his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (especially the frugal FXX League on the topic of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been cast in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral series Marcel - A Cuckoo in Boots.
Both Croll and Slate, like other young comedians with an original style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jesselnick, vicious, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview between David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central part of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he would sometimes walk down some alleyway between the two houses and think, “Well, if I run out of money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with local Taliban.
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the United Kingdom, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Prime Minister of Pakistan made a statement on the talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed the relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister said that dialogue with the Taliban movement has begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the north-western areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are trying to create an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad had made attempts to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only go to talks if the authorities took troops stationed in Taliban-held areas to places of permanent deployment, as well as to release the arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The price of oil dropped to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large reserves eclipsed a message showing that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark U.S. oil grade in December’s supply fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel on the late morning of European time in electronic auctions on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was reduced by 39 cents, which amounted to a 5.8 percent fall in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to pick up after the third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a benchmark type of international oil also used by U.S. refiners, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London Intercontinental Exchange.
The head coach of "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semena Varlamova from the first minutes of Friday's match with "Dallas", expressed confidence that the recent night behind the bar did not shake his confidence in the Russian, transmits from Dallas sobkor "Sel".
"What are we waiting for?" said Rua after the morning roll of the Lavin.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are sure of it and feel that it will be useful for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation has not affected the goalkeeper's condition?
We'll see today.
“There is no doubt that our players will support Varley in helping him guard the gate, as it was in previous matches this season.
Most importantly, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out in this situation.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: a greenhouse tomato will not replace a soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, a correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who have completely given up animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not tolerate winter without losses for health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them, according to the surveyed on the eve of Vegan Day Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not useful for health.
A complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with vegetable ones.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," - says the dietician Marina Bogay.
It is an example of a fish that contains the indispensable fatty acid Omega-3.
The most abundant vegetable oil is linseed oil.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the dietician.
Doctors are sure that the inhabitants of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In the conditions of our reality, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased caloric content.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, accordingly, he does not get this caloric content,” – says the specialist.
This is agreed by the doctor-dietologist Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared to better assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people do not want to bite a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more satisfying,” – explains the doctor.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is clearly not enough for a full-fledged diet.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in the organisms of Siberians is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May snow falls, is not advisable.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat,” – states the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
"The vegans don't get them," God is sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play in the toys he wants."
He has already formed an organism, a skeleton, organs.
Children should still be fed fully.
If the parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the surveyed medical specialists agree on the low quality of winter crops in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains fewer microelements than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of the products is not that,” says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
“The apples don’t turn brown on the slice, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes tasteless and unscented,” says the doctor, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fibers.
I do not agree with this in the laboratory of the Siberian Physico-Technical Institute of Agricultural Problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to expel more from a square meter, then, of course, and watering will become more frequent, and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
Court suspends execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-seek” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, a federal district appeals court suspended enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-see” program, and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. District Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said that the execution of Judge Shira Shandlin’s decisions will be suspended until the city receives the results of the appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution by implementing a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and orders for corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police department change its work practices and associated training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the application for a stay of the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be removed because she had violated the U.S. Judges’ Code of Conduct and had not considered it necessary to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Latinos under the “stop-and-see” program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the large-scale changes, which included policy, training and control reforms, and also decided to launch a pilot programme to test body-mounted video cameras in the police stations where the majority of arrests take place.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were stopped after a police check.
The debate on the appeal of the city should take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The “search stop” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of them black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all of them representatives of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit in court.
Supporters of the “stop-and-see” program at the New York Police Department say these changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more reliable and effective police service, and may affect how other police departments implement these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the “stop-and-see” practice, which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stop people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
There is a new pedestrian zone in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Throughout the street, street floorboards, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets are installed, deaf fences and illegal advertising are removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to cars - the Ordinsky stop, Big and Small Tolmachevsky lanes, Kadashevsky embankment and Bolotnaya square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Friday Street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Klimentovsky lane, conditions for pedestrians created without removing the movement and cutting the passage part, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the martyr Clement the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, Tverskaya Proezd, Stoleshnikov lane and Kuznetskyi Most street were completely pedestrianized.
Big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, it is decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to hacking the phone to verify a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used a “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke’s novel, which was then serving as interior minister.
The prosecutor, Royal Attorney Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey court in May 2005 that the News of the World had received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper ordered private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby's voicemail and guarded her at home to interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand next to someone’s house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the kind of person who likes to offer history to people to see what they will say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: hacking phones, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors of Clark’s novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source with a sexual interest in Ms. Polby said, “Don’t waste time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape containing voice messages received from her phone at least three times was taken from Mulcayre's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective's computer in which Miss Polby and her sister were listed as "Projects."
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby’s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Turleback and former reporter James Weserap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in the story was in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett about a romance with a married woman while he was dating his match Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with other people to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck, and Weserap confessed to the phone hacking.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to the authorities of Germany in the case of wiretapping
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the authorities of Germany, reports RIA Novosti.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snowden delivered a message to the German authorities.
Strebel had met Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tverskaya Street
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya street, four passers-by were injured.
As reported by "Interfax" with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, the passers-by, who were in a smokey underground passage during the fire, were injured.
As writes RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the capital department of fuel and energy economy Pavel Livinsky, at present in all houses on Tverskaya street the power supply is fully restored.
The fire in the heat collector near house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred in the evening of October 31.
Strong smoke came from the rainwater sewerage hatches, and in the underground passage, located at the store "Armenia", smoke formed.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were destroyed.
At 21:45 Moscow time the fire was extinguished.
U.S. cuts food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 a month
Since Friday, the U.S. has been cutting off the financial supply of food stamps, known as “food stamps,” as the government’s program ends.
On the food allowance, a family of four will now be allocated $36 per month less than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year, the per capita benefit was an average of $133 per month.
U.S. food aid spending has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 percent of Americans rely on free food aid issued by the Food Stamps, which have been so named since the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Food store owners across America are concerned that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how to reduce government funding even further.
Blizzard Releases 19-Year-Old Platformer for Free
Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne on PC for free.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available in Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that currently it can download only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's mercenaries and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously known as Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metro.
But selling tickets to passengers they will not for money, but for seating.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of sittings will be calculated by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket machines will be hosted by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
Recognitions of the National Security Agency increase the paranoia of corporations regarding state surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
Under instructions from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s internal intelligence service, he was tasked with photographing the roof of a U.S. embassy building less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV was hoping to detect the antennas of the eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. does not use foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The latest drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tapped, perhaps for about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it is quite likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technology and Internet capabilities, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are sceptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
And yet the coverage and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, made famous by Snowden’s revelations, has come as a shock to some companies that previously thought China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European company executives are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the U.S. program for intelligent Prism data analysis was unveiled.
Jim Snape, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely where my data is stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and hasn’t changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually don’t like to boast about the retaliatory measures they’ve taken, as this can give an advantage to the enemy.
Large companies have long been accustomed to the idea that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, at least, careless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi, says it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as wiretapping devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that executives of companies consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Pre-paid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV report warns.
The U.S. is warning its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The U.S. national intelligence team in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of violators who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all.”
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager who died by “ridiculous accident” believe their son was killed
Parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a twisted sports mat in his high school gym believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical mat sheltered behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
LOUNDES County Sheriff's Department investigators have concluded that Johnson died by a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old contests this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,” said Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, as well as to common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it’s a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed Johnson had died as a result of “positional asphyxia.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Loundes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras that investigators viewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to unraveling how he died.
"Spartak": For information about the persons who hung the fascist symbolism
On the official website of "Spartak" appeared a statement of the Moscow club about the appearance on the podium in Yaroslavl of the fascist flag.
"At the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We appeal to all those who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offence, with the request to provide it to the security service of FC Spartak-Moscow at the e-mail address fcsmsec@spartak.com.
“Reward is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" several times interrupted due to riots in the stands.
Also in the sector of fans of "Spartak" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
In the form of punishment, Spartak can hold about three matches without spectators.
A committee meeting will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried and hung this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations for schools regarding allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves — most often used for injections with an EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently made changes to the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is going on in my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “The tongue is tickling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “undetermined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender in children born with intermediate-type external genitalia.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be ascribed to the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as “undetermined” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I’m not a man and I’m not a woman.”
I'm going to be a doctor-created flake product with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorders" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovarians or seminal) or abnormally developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and appropriate it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most children don’t have them,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery as to why people are homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as being different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, and typically for both at the same time or is not characteristic of either.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair covering distribution, breast and body; primary sex characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes based on prejudice.
Boys with gender differences now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian man named Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be declared “unsexed” and defended the right to remain in “undefined” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F – X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this brightly-spoken Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning over two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told Baby Zone’s website that she would prefer children to have sex at birth.
“Growing a child is hard enough and without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites — named after a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And only ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything can be erased and then drawn again.
But now many question the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the gender assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case,’” Dresher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents raise a child — interact with a child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as “John/Joan,” his theories came into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision to completely castrate the child, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not,” Dresher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfied with the outcome.”
Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitalia.
The doctors could not determine for sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genitals and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.
Upon learning the truth, he became a man again, getting injections of testosterone and removing his chest.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he stands up for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersex.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child an ‘undefined gender’,” she said.
We're afraid he'll contribute to the intervention.
We think it’s better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven’t yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Temar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
German law implies its attribution at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, an X-ray mammologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.”
Because its androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katy is married and attending a pediatric psychiatry program at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and understand the situation, as well as the time interval before they write “male” or “female.”
In this case, you're fine - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in decision-making and eliminates the anxiety that drives parents because they don’t feel they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which gender he or she is more comfortable with — and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the "Yastrebov" Habibulin first missed six washes from "Tampa-Bay", and then four - from "Ottawa", and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed wash.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven’t been able to do that,” says CSNChicago.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably, it is worth to approach them as a game, and try to achieve a better result.
You need to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowcomb.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
Goalkeepers – I don’t think I’m the only one – always try to have the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in the mood.
It doesn’t matter what happens at my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many washes.
“It’s great that my teammates support me, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to play the next game better.

Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that once the Superjet 100 aircraft is installed in Latin America and Asia, it will be delivered to Europe.
“We expect that in total, we will receive such agreements on more than 170 aircraft of this type,” said Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, speaking at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eyro.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, as this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that one day it will be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister said.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the company "Civil Aircraft Dry" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Energetics of Dnipropetrovsk began a unique program to save... nest of aistov
In ancient times, to bring to the courtyard of the Aistos, peasants on a high column installed a wheel from the cart, and a heavy nest well held on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so the aist loved the pillars of the power lines - the intertwined branches rely on wires, thanks to which the real house stands reliably.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district has been living a real family for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new vents on top, and the bottom layer has already slid between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity that the family of Aistos, who every year nested at the yard, brought out and fed three or four birds during the summer, but also do not want to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm lands, grandmother Anya called Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still held at all, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovsky.
On the wires, which turned out to be, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any moment, the birds could die from electric discharge.
And local residents risked being left out of the light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear monitors began the operation to save the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
Helped scientists-ornithologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of the district networks.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was calculated that there are more than 50 real "apartments" in the area in an emergency state.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was strewn with branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the owners will build their own house.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka Novomoskovsky district.
A new reinforced concrete pillar was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the energy companies nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same new settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district in the yard of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the previous place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has been overhauled.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky regions of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
The other day, the whole area was covered with sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot the swan family, who lived on the local pond for entertainment.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and the four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now the employees of the Apostolic District Police Department are figuring out who shot the birds recorded in the Red Book.
The Russian march is becoming more popular.
On the 4th of November, on the Day of National Unity, an agreed with the city hall "Russian March" will be held in Moscow.
According to a survey of the Levada Center, support for the Russian Marches is growing - already 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the Russian marches: 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions welcomed only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events supported already twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to the "Russian marches" are only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital Alexei Mayorov said today.
This action of nationalists has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia are held "Russian marches" under the slogans of protection of the rights of Russians in Russia?" three-quarters (75%) of citizens responded negatively.
Only one in five Russians knows about this action (20%).
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the “Russian Marches”.
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place in Manege Square, which grew into mass riots.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the right answer (Day of Popular Unity) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
About the same amount (17%) intend to celebrate the 7th of November Day of the October Revolution.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Hall agreed the “Russian March” in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the “Russian March” on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of People's Unity, a rally and rock concert of the group "Colour", also agreed with the authorities, will be held.
How was the "Russian March 2012"
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from Yakimanskaya embankment to the Central House of the artist, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6 thousand.
Report: Obama's campaign staff considered Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton’s candidacy in the 2012 election.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign "The stakes are doubled: the game changed in 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides had conducted “large-scale focus group research and public opinion polls in late 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise fading hopes of re-election.
According to political commentator The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of high-ranking officials of the election headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration Bill Daley, to assess what effect the appointment of the former vice president will have on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book "The stakes are doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately declined this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I was actively advocating for a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, “Oh my God, what are we going to do?”
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary check,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the election staff had invested enough in studying whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“The pre-election headquarters don’t spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they’re serious about something,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about a possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that, “maybe,” Obama knew.
Martin added that the “doubled rates” does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe came to the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he was serious about whether Obama was aware of an investigation into whether Biden could be removed from the electoral roll.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a glow in the dark of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world’s first dark-shining ice cream with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with the idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Liznie Me, I’m Delicious, says: “It’s an incredible thing, but it’s still in the very early stages of production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you’ll get about 2g of the substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it is quite pleasant to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of sesame gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said: “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the ice-crystal-induced refraction of ice, which consists of ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular KHL championship against "Salavata", noted that the Omichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that the "Avangard" needs to pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of the "Avangard" of the word Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of washes, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the course - three wasps were killed.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in the preparation for today's game?
Me and the guys are every match carefully figuring out, talking after the game, preparing for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metalurg.
The game was played and the score was 2-0.
They missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to make mistakes.
Given how difficult the game was, I didn’t see the point in connecting defenders.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now "Avangard" has a long home series, the matches go in a day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is not so difficult to solve.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, for almost a week on the border with Russia in a row are hundreds of furs.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets.
Hundreds of furs were piled up at the border points when entering Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the turn is created by the Russian side, which has not previously warned about innovations.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the deputy head of the Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
The checkpoints are operating in enhanced mode.
The FACTOV correspondent visited the border and talked to the truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside coffee shop at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are increasing every day, as is the turn of the Fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, they were still allowed, and then these rules were introduced, - complains the truck driver Alexey Golovanov (in the photo), who transports goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is transported.
The minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5 thousand rubles (about 1100 - 1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo costing up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and travel.
And the rest of them are stuck - because no one has such big money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a cargo in the amount of only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - none - are set by truckers, who are arranged to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers orientated and quickly screwed them: 15 hryvnia is worth a bar, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
And a coffee one.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, then we go to the toilet.
Not to wash, not to shave...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife has prepared everything for me on the road.
For a week, - comforts another trucker Victor Skotarenko.
Will my car arrive in a week’s time?
Why do you have a liter and a half of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a bottle of crystal or water insists on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the saleswoman's steaming.
After the situation began to be reported in the media, the authorities of the region turned their attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoazovsky district administrations were instructed to provide drinking water to all those who are idle on the Ukrainian-Russian border, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk Regional Administration Sergey Dergunov.
Emergency teams are now on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotoilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional Administration, 32 and 68 cars were unloaded at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" as of October 31, respectively.
"Facts" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in attempt to defame Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “talk” Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania many times and participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also involved in the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov regularly visited Lithuania under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
The day before, the President of Lithuania Gribauskait<0xC4><0x97> said that she knew about the information attack being prepared for her.
According to her, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the country's drive for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in the Kremlin to Lithuania are treated "insufficiently respectable".
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of applying to Lithuania “only requirements”.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian “milk” into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country’s government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, the headmaster of the school shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American high schools teenagers literally led to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take up arms and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw a man’s house with toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the property of the director, he was charged with assault in aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest, California, just across the street.
After that, the criminal took hostage two random passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier in the primary school of the city of Newtown, Connecticut, a shooting was opened.
Adam’s mother worked at the school, she was an educator.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at a U.S. school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Hallowe'en 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and make a masquerade for our area.
Now I look more like a scrotum.
I haven’t had the urge to deliver candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won’t this year either.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for the men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will get into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes they are looking for most often are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't care.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about <0xC2><0xA3>600 million worth of Hershey chocolates, lentils, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar candies.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-seeking children who are ready to conquer our areas.
What’s more, we’ll buy and – let’s not fool ourselves – eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sweets in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly 35 million pounds of them are sold under Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like home with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “Fear Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Voy and Scream” and “House of Shock”.
What’s more, according to the American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you’ve almost described yourself, that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can’t remove, and then the guy who likes the photo looks like you.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we’ve been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, baby fashion in pumpkin started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more challenging tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting out any of their pumpkins weighing in at <0xC2><0xA3>2032.
Estonian Ministry of Defense website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyber attack, the press service of the Ministry of Defense reported.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense on information and administrative issues Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, so far the site has been restored.
“The damage to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions from it, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted a message on the network in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn’t need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone’s slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
“Hands away from Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marines of the Feodosiya separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines will take part in the command-staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the violence, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed due to the students being attacked by... goblins.
According to the local elder, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue classes.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention to a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed due to the fact that medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Announced the release of the Land Rover racing series
Inside there are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to the mechanics of Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the car between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants turning to Bowler have changed.
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We were very happy to develop the Defender Challenge car – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces know nothing about the group "Brother's Circle" - New News
This is what INTERFAX.RU writes with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After the media reported that the U.S. Treasury Department had placed Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate Fraternal Circle, we looked at all the databases, but such a grouping was not found,” the source said.
According to him, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As they wrote earlier “NI”, yesterday the US Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brothers Circle”.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Sin", laid out the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth are indicated.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, it is believed that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money to the bandits on their order.
To this message is attached a photo of the singer and all his data, which correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency said it intends to impose sanctions on Leps.
The inclusion of a person in the blacklist of the US Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him persons living in the United States.
Leps assistant Maya Serikova said that no notification to the singer was received: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Grigory, who everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is media reports.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the U.S. Treasury, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Running out on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details about the identity of the fan, who escaped on the field during the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak" became known.
According to the head of the KDC of the Russian Federation, Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break into the field: "It turned out that this, let's call him a spectator, went to an ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He approached the ambulance - this was confirmed by the doctor immediately.
And then he pushed two companions away and ran to the field.
It ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern tribunes to the corner of the Eastern and Northern tribunes.
He ran across the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Law on Sport, this is the area of action of the stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the tribune, crossed the Eastern tribune.
And at this time, riots began in the Eastern Tribune and on the treadmills," the head of the KDK said.
Recall that the decision of the KDK Moscow "Spartak" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit", and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire crews were called in to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous retreat in his career.
Cocker-spaniel Ruby ran away after falling into a small accident
Three days later, her career stuck, noticed a man walking a dog.
Firefighters descended on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky to be rescued after fire crews were called in to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow got stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope slope.
A nine-month-old cocker spaniel ran away after she was in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappitt's career in the city of Denholm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and posting addresses on social media sites after she ran away into a career after a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog trainer spotted Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet at a career retreat.
A technical rescue team from Clekhiton's fire station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carry-on to lift her up a slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous situation.”
It was right in the middle of a steep slope – 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's all right now.
Then she ate the cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is amazing.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a chance that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and it was found that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The vet said that if she had become debilitated and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson from the town of Kitley added, “We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger Says He Didn't Play With Katy Perry When She Was 18
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backup vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and noted, “He played with me when I was 18.”
She added: “It was a very long time ago and he was very good.”
In a statement Thursday, a spokesman for the 70-year-old Jagger said he "categorically denies that he ever hit for Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrian's shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement across the rest of Europe, although — predictably — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone indicated that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules around as they see fit.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
This is not a worthy story.
And it’s so old that it’s turned into a fossil: for the first time I’ve heard a “trick” that “independence means passport control,” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposing the EU or calling for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party — founded this year alone — emerged from nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus essentially ousting the Free Democrats (an analogue of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments operating in excessive budget deficits, which was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a disadvantageous position in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save money is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacities.
As a result of the set of “green” energy measures introduced by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
This is paralyzingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have already seen in Granjmut.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU’s most ardent supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s ruined economy in dire straits.
The result is the anti-EU right-wing Marine Le Pen’s National Front party just won a decisive additional election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split between the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties receive support in this election, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: the soon-to-be-growing moods against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are coming together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague “Europe (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific, however, points to the likelihood that Britain will remain unattended in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a freer European agreement, provided that we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, strangely enough, the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections to cuts in spending proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer and the incumbent Chancellor of the Exchequer.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Sexual Maturation: Aging Earlier
African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation is close.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the launching mechanisms of early sexual maturation
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form mammary glands and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — usually it doesn’t mean a quick onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Early Sexual Maturation in Girls: How to Cope with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes an actual onset of sexual maturity, but it is considered "premature" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - this is something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may serve as a basis for analysis by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is wary of drugs, but admits that “sex-maturity suppression can alleviate girls’ behavioral problems and feelings that they are different from peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many theories about the causes of early sexual maturation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, as in girls, sexual maturation occurs earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, early sexual maturation seems to affect everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although in boys hair on the face and on the forehead appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of childbearing age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when this happens earlier than expected, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing for departure
Having conducted surveillance flights over the territory of Russia as part of the Open Skies Treaty and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 am Moscow time will leave the air port of the city.
The management of the airport allowed the departure of the board, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
It was reported that the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, according to ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, according to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports of Russia - in Kubinka and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and involves 34 States.
Observation flights are made over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, the enhancement of crisis prevention and crisis resolution capabilities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do deceased celebrities earn - MK in the United States MK
The highest-earning living celebrity ranking in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was “suppressed” by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Notably, he lags behind other celebrities who have gone out of their lives, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "consistent" departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below the author of the comics Peanuts Charles Schulz with 37 million.
The top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
The first boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow

I am very happy to have opened a shop in Moscow.
It’s not just an office, it’s a place where there really is a part of me.
It was with these words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted to... try the models!
Manufacturers of jet aircraft are angry about the width of the seat, when on horseback large orders
A heated dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always in the focus of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class lounges, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and the event on November 17-21 is expected to potentially record orders.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row — is central to the cost-effectiveness of the new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will seat 406 people, based on seats in economy class over 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy-class seats with a width of 18 inches, arranged 9 in a row.
Aircraft construction giants are often exchanged for technical blows with advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly in front of the Dubai air show, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the start of a new advertising war by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, titled “Would you agree to it?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the widebody Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of 1950s seating, when the average waist circumference of those who have recently been called “reactive audiences” was already.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study showing that an extra inch of seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ seat size figures and says manufacturers shouldn’t interfere in decisions about how airlines strike a balance between fares and amenities.
According to her, research shows that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really all about giving airlines the choice and opportunity to do what they believe they need to do to succeed,” said Kent Craver, a Boeing cabin specialist.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for orders for aircraft valued at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of U.S. and European exports.
As the Reuters news agency first reported in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20-percent increase in profitability per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s stated specifications are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat 777 series layout.
The gain in the specific cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seater layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more space and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus’ head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating that can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is driven by a threat from the 777 model,” said Mary Kirby, interior designer, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Around the world, jet aircraft vendors even carry roulettes with them to check out competing plans.
praising the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense layout of the cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider seating at the aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “take off”, but can distract from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May Detract from the Process of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York’s Well Cornell College of Medicine said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” he said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from receiving a nicotine shot.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And mice that were not given the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystall said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements of the Moscow suburbs are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of Sub-Moscow Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
In total, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the revenues of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidies.
Within the framework of budget security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget,” Oleynikov said.
Also, the Deputy Governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the budget revenues amount to more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas of less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipal formations of the Moscow region until the end of November to think about which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or change the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Previously, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of grant rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaysky, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsky, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniky there is a request for the enlarging of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Mosoblduma Igor Brynzalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 regions of the Moscow region are planned to unite everything within the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidised.
Diana Arbenina Celebrates Halloween with Her Children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great pleasure she receives from the upbringing of her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina especially spends a lot of time on creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to fuck with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as possible.
For the last week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
At first, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday I kissed the fans, showing them how to dress up Artema and Martha for Halloween.
We are ready to race on broomsticks! our first Halloween" - so called Diana a photo of her children, dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have something to do with this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an “indefinite gender” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born with hermaphrodites, instead of male or female, to indicate "undefined".
Parents of the child will have the right to temporarily leave the count "sex" in the birth certificate of the unfulfilled.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can temporarily write "X" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to hurry with the operation to "accurate" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphroditism.
Tripod denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied making changes to the leases of offshore properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three state-owned real estate properties.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to extend the lease agreement on Serkyular Ki, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without tendering after their expiration date in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in the properties, following testimony given to Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynn Ashpole, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions beginning in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for open competition.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the contracts for the leases of the companies on Serkyular Ki, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of open tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged changes to the Government's rental policy.
The ICAC's deciphering of telephone conversations included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
“Was the question discussed during these telephone conversations a question of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willi’s assistant, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obey.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for “authenticity”
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified positions or as a loophole for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKay criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
"The loud statements like 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'first job for Australians' represent a very unpleasant retreat to a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criteria are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined to determine “whether the application is genuine under conditions where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person relevant to the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of 457 subclass visas, as previously, enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving by boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old son, who was killed in the crash, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship since his father’s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities rushed the man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semena Varlamova Yevgeny Vavriniuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavrynyuk filed in court for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the guilty to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested but later released on bail of $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrynyuk.
He is also facing up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic effect for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Stage in 2026
Baroness Kramer, the transport minister, said the project would “unite Britain”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first stage will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements to rail capacity and a reduction in travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unanimously” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, which is already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Is Thorium a New Hope for Nuclear Energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet their energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste in the recycling process.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
The rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to soften the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required U.S. airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently does not have specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times, and passengers to comply with safety rules that are communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the extension of use on board its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of permitting the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the spokesman said.
Qantas said it would abide by the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change them anytime soon,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAU’s decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft is resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review the manuals, training materials, hand luggage regulations and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms the resilience of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group’s recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the anthem Kubani notes of extremism
The football match between Anzhi and Kubani resulted in a political clash between the authorities of Krasnodar Krai and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kubani sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday suggested that republican parliamentarians go to court because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for interethnic discord, in particular, calls for a war with the "Basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"Remembering you here as a mother, an enemy, a basurmanin, we go to the battle of death" - for what such words to write in the hymn, to poison some believers on other believers, - expressed solidarity with Abdulatip's Speaker of the Parliament Hizri <0xC5><0xA0>ihsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck the missiles of Russian production, which, according to reports, were intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition – to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the U.S. not to conduct a military operation that they came close to this summer.
More about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president, our chief international correspondent Richard Engel will tell.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poisonous gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the declared factories for the production of chemical weapons.
A longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it is about a thousand tons.
Earlier, Washington had said that Assad’s days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets, and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are hungry.
Some people have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a man ready for cooperation.
Today in Washington, the U.S. Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be any easier than not being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is still there.
And he's changing weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Residential Complexes
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry that oversees construction and housing and proposed to head his former governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a face-to-face meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Mene at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Mene did not refuse to head the new department.
The press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all the functions related to construction and sanitary facilities are transferred to the new Ministry from the Ministry of the Interior.
Mikhail Men, son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Meni, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995 he began his political career - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergiyev-Posadsky district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Region, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
Singapore’s pawnshop owners are doing well, while the middle class is having a hard time.
In a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemir shopping centre, Gianni Amirthalinga puts on a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its trade, this week became the third pawnbroker registered on Singapore’s stock exchange.
A loan secured by jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, Singapore’s pawnbrokers charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
Millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by the rising cost of living and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to make up for declining incomes as their economy slows.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family’s credit rating, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income scale] will be looking for ways to top up their income wherever they can,” says Song Sung Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people put their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed in the 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest pawnbroker, has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion, using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on Singapore’s stock exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Customers are putting in items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
At the same time, pawnbrokers are not only used by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, laying gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of existing medical institutions and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of health of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013"., reorganization of medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and obstetricians.
Thus, after joining with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGCB for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, modern equipment, corresponding to world standards, appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the overhaul of premises, 112 units of equipment for the amount of 42 million rubles were purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the surgical section of the caesarean section, the apparatus "Cell-Sewer" is used, allowing to collect blood from the surgical wound and after special treatment to return her uterus, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
The department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
In the women's consultation, there is an electronic registry, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic maps and stories of patients' disease.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns with regional specialists.
The Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens have been arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
According to reports, the bandits ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then beat and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old previously convicted native of Chechnya.
Bavaria defender David Alaba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he overcame representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - a ski jump from the jumper Gregor Schlierenc<0xC3><0xA4>uer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Ex-wife Arshavina is resting with actor Andrey Chadov
Former civilian wife of the footballer of St. Petersburg "Zenit" Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya is on vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhna, her fiancé - figure skater Sergey Slavnov, and actor Andrey Chadov.
Photos from the joint walks of couples are published on Instagram Anastasia Zadorozhna.
This is not the first photo of Andrew and Julia together.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a photo in which the couple stands hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, havbek "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Julia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently, it became known that Arshavin is dating the ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
A $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be complemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government doesn’t waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and limitations of the system.
The funding decision was made after four years of consultation with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per Blitz campaign for planned operations.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without prior registration, in Hobart and Lonsest<0xC3><0xB3>n, to improve the quality of after-care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of systems of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will build on the ideas put forward by leading doctors on how best to help Tasmania’s health care system,” said Ms. Pliebersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would operate under strict accountability and accountability.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds, and to report monthly on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable footing.
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the prime minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the removal of this state’s health care system from critical condition,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely offset recent reductions.
But federal health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is “a decision similar to a leukoplastyr.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labor government has ripped $430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government rips off almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend that it’s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The film adaptation of Denny Diderot's novel by Guillaume Niccolo boasts exceptional staging and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should be.
The film, set in 1760s France, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadistic boss and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never sinks to the ground or the sensation – and that’s the whole problem.
Because of its solemnity, the story risks becoming a test for the audience as well.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons, Says Monitoring Group
Syria has destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the country’s civil war nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the
the deadline of 1 November set by that organization based in The Hague for Damascus to destroy or “make inoperable” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with the production of poisonous gas and filling them with ammunition.
Completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles is yet to begin in Damascus.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production facility, as well as its storage sites, according to the UK-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
According to the government, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of them linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, adjusted by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of toxic arsenals, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all of Syria’s declared critical production facilities and mixing/refuelling equipment.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria’s statement, “abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program contained in them were moved to other reported sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safir was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said Ahmet Uzyumdzhi, director general of the observer group, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, the branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the verdict of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators, who appeared before the court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he receives a conditional early release.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, though they could insist that a man dubbed a “subverter” for his reputation as a master at making explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back her tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the shooting team,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have any more grandchildren and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into operation in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the three other members of the terrorist cell “Jemaa Islamia”, responsible for the bloody massacre – the Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the perpetrators of the Bali terror attack to appear in court.
He hid for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent revealed that the intelligence evidence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” Ms. Cortin said.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Passengers should not expect the change to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU Administrator Michael Wart told a news conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device layout rules to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does "good".
Passengers should switch off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and driving, FAU said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “on duty at school” when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there are still no “Words with Friends” — an intelligent online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a notorious case: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device at the time the plane landed.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stored in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not FAU.
FAU may lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can create interference for cellular highs when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by FAU to look into the issue recommended last month that the government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAUs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no good security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by FAU as being resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years now.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners have been adapted for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Warta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded an entire airliner with their devices to read Kindle e-books and flew on it to check for problems, but did not detect them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said he believes device interference is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only separate messages from pilots confirming that the devices could create interference to aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to turn off the devices during landings on devices in low visibility conditions.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a common-sense step towards the passengers, who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, director general of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Auto schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining driver's license
Driver’s license exams can be taken by private companies with their own computerized autodrome.
About it writes "Kommersant" with reference to the draft government resolution "On admission to the management of vehicles".
According to the newspaper, currently in Russia only about 30 such autodromes.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" motor schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Auto Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theoretical exams and more than 20% of the site students do not pass from the first time, such a school will be deprived of the privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorhomes contained in the draft government decree will come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains training requirements for driving two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, owners of motorcycles to obtain category A rights will have to pass the exam in conditions of urban movement.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such employees will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird tossed in the air into a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild
The bird, flown to shore after it was found in a depleted state on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water heron was placed on a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, and was then taken out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at a rescue centre in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird became impotent and was able to find shelter on the oil hill.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes Britain’s wealth and jobs creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of business in the UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are at a standstill.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on a long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the trading zone of Europe, – agreed even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a course of treaty change and trade-based relations with the EU, not politics.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is insisting on a “significant change” that will bring power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving treaty changes and more favourable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as our survey results show, for business this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activities.
U.S. special services are listening to the Pope's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful eye of U.S. intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all of the previous Pope Benedict’s talks, and is now closely watching Pope Francis.
His phone started ringing before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under scrutiny.
What the United States has given special importance to.
The special services connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who had gathered in Rome to choose the next pope.
The telephones of the residence where the members of the conclave lived were also heard.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
The magazine “Panorama” writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the conclave was completed on March 12.
It is claimed that in the United States since 2005, the Argentine archbishop Bergoglio has been singled out as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence was also lagging behind in the negotiations surrounding the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, extracting information about policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has acquiesced to the fact that it does not care about American wiretapping, even if it happens.
From the leadership of the United States, the holy fathers have no secrets.
The snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday released a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But in the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from a banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free stock photo StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a tutorial on Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue-blue gamma.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Hot Bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from the springboard, but in the end chose a snowboard, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion about the widespread spread of the image of a snowboarder with an Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
Head of the press service of the State Sign Natalia Nikiforova told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will turn right, in photos on the net - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
A person in a photo session to create a bill was taken from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - a characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
The recognisability of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - says Alexey Popovichev, Executive Director of RusBrand.
Proving the 100% similarity of images on a bill and in photo banks is quite difficult, so lawsuits against intellectual property on this image are unlikely to occur.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative 10 yuan banknote was issued for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Law bans have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although the businessmen initially expected to grow.
After all, this year is a failure for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps, told about all this at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute “The Goods of Daily Demand in Russia”, which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer, a drink with a low alcohol content, Sheps told listeners.
No country in the world has such a strict beer market restriction, unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer visited that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have a special impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The sickest among the producers of beer hit the ban imposed since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” said Isaac Sheps.
Next year, brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps talked about: sales of foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties designed for the mass consumer, to the class "premium": beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of diseases of alcoholism remains at about the same level," said the doctor-narcologist Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use strong drinks, as well as those who "sit" on alcohol-containing tonics like "Jaguar", increased, while ten years ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevologsk.
As they say in the unions, all the dismissed received compensation.
However, far more acute than the problems of workers, the question of reducing industrial production in the region arises.
Deputy of the Regional ZakS Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that at the factory of the company "Ford" in Vsevologsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened back in September: then, under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the factory.
Workers, who decided to resign on their own will, were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority have left jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is an entire night shift.
I don't think this case will be limited.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs in the next two years to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction of jobs.
At Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolzhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known back in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As a reason at the plant called the drop in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, at the end of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States will be able to use mobile during takeoff and landing of the aircraft
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules will come into effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet connection for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the risk of interference from aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will still be banned.
Passengers will thus be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, according to the example of the United States, the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised in the United Kingdom.
For the "Russian mafia" in the United States has finally established a new name - "Brother's Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America was supplemented by new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the fraternal circle.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspected of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, the United States blacklists 22 people involved in the “Brotherly Circle” and six affiliated organizations with it.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization really exists.
“The ‘Brotherhood Circle’ statement is more like an attempt to bring together disparate criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
According to him, the “Brotherly Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
"I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," Galeotti said, according to the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
I agree with Mr. Galeotti and George Mason University Professor Liz Shelley.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, not an organization,” the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brothers Circle” unites more closely Russian thieves in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Father Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhariya Kalashova, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandfather Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals have nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his opinion, they were all rather united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the “Brotherly Circle” attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the spokesman of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today there was a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over a contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price once the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries located further along the pipeline’s route by the end of the year.
The pipeline’s annual design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsk region, the driver of the car "Peugeot" went to the opposite lane on the 115 km of the Odessa-Reni road, and collided with a bus, in which there were six people.

Two YMCA employees charged with sex crimes before charges against Jonathan Lord, as reported by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual crimes against children before being charged in 2011 against a childcare worker at Jonathan Lord's Care in Carrington, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children said.
But the commission’s opening statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Philip Hayre was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA in its opening speech to the commission also admitted inaccuracy, arguing that “there were external YMCA audits recognizing that the YMCA was at the forefront of child safety.”
The evidence submitted to the Commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible end-to-end evaluations based on a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed to hire Lord and had failed to provide a clear understanding by staff of their obligations regarding reporting of child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
The staff testified that they had witnessed the violations, including Lord being alone with the children, taking care of them personally, putting them to his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowing them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the guidance of Lord and asked to teach her how to protect the children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child care manager at the YMCA in Carrington, who was a hard-working Lord's supervisor, "and a very hard worker."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff’s explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord drove them away from the thought of having to report him.
Mr. Hare said he presented his view to the New South Wales YMCA Council that the lesson for organizing the “Jonathan Lord incident” was not “about providing information” from employees, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations appeared was made by YMCA’s Director General of Child Care Liam Whitley.
He said that this was meant to prevent the destruction of evidence, but at the same time “exasperated” and this decision was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organization during Jonathan Lord’s 2009-2011 work on it, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearings were postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Her homeland is considered not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle B<0xC3><0xBC>ndschen left her job for a while, being distracted by motherhood, these days and this week she came to the parade specifically.
The long absence did not prevent her to keep her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world’s highest-paid supermodel.
This time she participated in the Colchis fashion show.
The end of fashion week is usually the most interesting shows.
Like what the stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of the pre-a-port luxury class, the model actively works in theater and cinema, designing performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, in the final week of fashion in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo took part more than 30 thousand firms and companies that are related to the textile industry and the fashion world.
This is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, it employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair has said he will take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admits that a return is unlikely.
On the eve of the evening in an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his departure, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since retiring in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it’s unlikely to happen, so...”
The head coach of Milan Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret about the poor result in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of the leading players.
I am very sorry that we failed to win, - Tmw quotes Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second Roman added, but in general I can not say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we did our best to get into the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of horse racing events going to Cardiff to fight for the prize of the “Horse of the Year” knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he had made his first steps, this little boy with his pet Shetland pony Toffee raced wildly through three laps to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, of the same height, received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sannibank equestrian center in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Coming to the general view against the background of men and women in elegant slippers, he unbuttoned his hat and proudly spent around the circle of two-year-old Toffi.
Judges praised Fenton for his innate ability to handle horses that had not been developed over the years.
And Toffee got the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffie on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been engaged in Shetland pony riding every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Phenton and Toffie are a great duo.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rookie.
It was only his second appearance with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
The completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, “The whole audience was stunned, and everyone was shouting out their endorsements and clapping.”
He ran across the sand the entire length of the arena, and though he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens to take care of.
Judging by how he started, he will soon be taking part in “Horses of the Year” — and I’m sure he will perform well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffie for their appearance and for how they presented themselves in the show ring.
They appreciate the harmony between the pony and the breeder – Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
Chinese newspaper’s call ‘to be restructured’
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the first strip a call for the release of the accused in defamation, should be reorganized, the press regulator reports.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made an unexpected public statement with a request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false articles about a state-owned company.
Now the “New Express” has to go through “the process of full error correction”, as the regulator reports.
The order to “correct errors” came from the Guangdong government in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group’s newspaper, New Express, published several false reports about Zoomlion’s stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of the New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it was decided “to impose an administrative fine on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to fully correct the errors in the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the responsible persons of the newspaper and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television, acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying that the newspaper had failed to properly check its reporting.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of making confessions in China is still widespread, despite the recently passed amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-referencing.
A U.S.-Mexico drug-transport tunnel has been discovered, equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
U.S. officials have described the four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most difficult secret moves they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, the zigzags of which make up the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were imperceptibly transported through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
The three men, who according to law enforcement officials were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life in prison.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the harvesting of marijuana in October, which put drug cartels in a difficult position to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.

British police give Assange a notification of extradition.
British police today handed over the extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had given the 40-year-old Australian “an official request to surrender” with a request to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply with that request, he would continue to be arrested.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his powers under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking for political asylum from this South American country.
“Scotland Yard has given a 40-year-old man an official request to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on a day and time of our choosing,” the spokesman said.
It still violates the terms of the bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible espionage charges after more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables were posted on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
A driver driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howey of Tiptry, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry him between his legs.
In Colchester's World Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver's license led to a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 in costs and an additional <0xC2><0xA3>100 fee to help victims of crime.
A tax on foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% state duty rate for homes worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual payments to buyers who decide to own homes in goods.
At the moment, the <0xC2><0xA3>708 million estate tax on residential real estate in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea in the 2012/13 financial year is already in excess of the total in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West, Yorkshire and the West Midlands.
Mr Cook said: “After the increase in state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is low regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy a property in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The price of first-class real estate – the top 5–10% of the housing market at a price – in London’s rich south-westerly belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a Savills study, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but were eclipsed by the city’s booming “domestic market” with price surges in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%).
Scientists have shed light on how a dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
Early studies have shown that satisfied dogs tip their tails to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs tip their tails to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tail curling and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigar, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people’s left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just as in humans, dogs have the right part of the brain controlling the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the versatile tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes turn in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and steer the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw that the dog was not expressing anything at all moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog squeezing its tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mostly to the left (again, from the point of view of the dog's tail tipping), their heartbeat was racing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn’t think dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried about, and what they should not.
He notes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs, and often their tails tipping in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
The researchers say these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting scientist at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to test whether dogs matter to the left and right sides.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
In another scientific paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was tipped to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite behavior toward the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be a useful study of how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a gig in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was scheduled to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The band's statement came after it was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to move the show to Birmingham’s LG Arena tonight and following an appeal for medical assistance, the Arctic Monkeys are also expected to postpone the show at the Hydro venue in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and, unfortunately, he is unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro venue will take place on November 21.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this has caused them.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will raise the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his term of office on February 22, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – this is the prerogative of a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the ceremony.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a Consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said the pope usually calls as many cardinals as he needs to bring back the number of cardinal electors to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Consistory next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we weren’t in this situation before – it was all for us for the first time.
Valero said the popes were usually raised as cardinal bishops from major parishes, but Francis “is full of surprises — so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls a number of new pickup trucks in the U.S. to refine seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address issues with manual seat back tilt adjustment, according to a notice submitted Friday by U.S. auto safety regulators.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with the federal standards for the safety of motor vehicles on the head restraints.
“In the event of a rear-end collision, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notification posted on its website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
Production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into serial production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickup trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to consider notifying owners of a 16-day government shutdown that reduced car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model year series, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday rose 1.4 percent to $37.47.
Obama Voter's Cry of Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says Obama has allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to nullify praiseworthy efforts.
Obstructionism can’t justify problems with Obama’s reformed health system website, drone attacks
The memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me in times of sadness in the second year of medical school and give me a renewed sense of hope.
It’s called Courage to Win, and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people, and speeches could have captured the spirit.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents were guarding all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning is now a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I could not even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule, the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after countless times I’ve been on the side of the Obama administration, defending it from colleagues and peers, I’ve run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or the drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers exposing the government’s illegal actions.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or failure to comply with the limits of state funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He can’t justify the report’s findings that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, it can’t justify not being able to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that working in an elected position is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by opposition political parties and such random events as the massacre in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have listed above show that they were largely the choice of the administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented an incomprehensible and crude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, having freed himself from the pressure of future elections, justified the hopes that we have heard about for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much harder to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have flown away.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a stupendous defeat on Obama in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain true to their purpose.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer argues that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of leave to care for a child.
Billionaire lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unsettled dispute over a $6 million carbon tax, made the statement at a time when he was trying to shake off questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in making a decision to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get a leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for the seat from the Sunshine Coast of the Fairfax electoral district with a majority of 53 votes after the recount of votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral vote counting procedure to speed up the process.
She is the daughter of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on this election be made two months after we have voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system so that we can come in, input our data into the computer, vote right away, and get the result at 6:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for marking in bulletins.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring opportunities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would be “very serious” about his new job.
The public office implies service to society.
“We are not seeking any awards other than the gratitude of history, for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS removes two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended the work of two traders in its currency operations unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further confirmation that the global check by regulators of alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be removed in the course of a unfolding investigation, which echoes the scandal surrounding manipulations of the LIBOR interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from regulatory authorities.
“Our ongoing investigation into the matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, whistleblowers said RBS had handed over records of e-mails and instant messages it received and sent to its former trader, the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave for his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to insiders.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s antitrust body Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that the bankers conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also begun internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, officials familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been looking through instant messages and emails for several years in search of crime cases.
News of the checks has stirred up traders in the sphere of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at a very small price”.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had sacked one of the traders in its London Stock Exchange trading division this week after it caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama’s health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, are constitutional under the government’s taxing powers.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The court also left the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law in force and further ruled that the health care law’s requirement that states increase compliance with Medicaid requirements, otherwise they will lose all federal funding for Medicaid, is not unconstitutionally coercive.
The bill has been blocked by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football - the reason for the differences?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the “Open Tribune”, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - some scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society”, politics and the media must be correct in their statements.
Perhaps he was referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if there is not want to limit the birth rate ...
All the speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples who inhabit Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Birulev are "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and instances responsible for these questions", and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been practiced against migrants in Europe, according to the publicist, has failed, and we need to find our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified textbook of history.
“It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennadiy Zyuganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility for "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If in the United States say on the radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to burn.
As usual, in everything he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to the public discussion: “In the dust of controversy, is there not much to say!”
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "paper" and agree to conduct talks on this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can be assumed by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for the inter-ethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm about this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, the subjects will treat the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and the methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gadzhimet Safaraliev, proposed the creation of a special department with the terrible name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valeriy Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, abolished later, opposed.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a “minister without a portfolio”, to whom you could turn, if anything.
“We are walking along the edge, the shells are breaking down nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work should receive worthy information support,” said the representative of the Russian Federation on relations with the society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the state with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should not, in his opinion.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be looked for, but they are pushed not the way, not the way," he said.
"Not the road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten by the whole crowd, then the flags are burned, then the comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in this kind of sport!" - said the right-winger.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened immediately.
You'll offer them more kerling!
It is necessary to know the national features, it is like Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer"...
In Yaroslavl, the wild behavior on the stands was distinguished by representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football will be banned across the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation Artur Grigoryants said that "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles, reports the House of football correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied to the burning of the Dagestan flag by fans in the stands during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
At the meeting there were representatives of both clubs, a man from RFPL.
We looked at all the available materials.
For the unlawful behavior of the audience "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei filed lawsuits against Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone makers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it broke at Nortel’s bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, has filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare search keywords on the Internet with their corresponding advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the foundation of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and gave no comments.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running on Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was partly Motorola’s patent library.
“Despite a failed attempt to acquire the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google, as it claims that the patent infringement by Google is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president to be sworn in
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence has been a banned organization of other governments that has served as a target for other governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small procession shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak’s time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the usually busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “replacement wheel” by the Brothers, his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamists, but also of all those who want to bring to the end the cause of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubar.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in a wooden paneled hall where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra, performing a state anthem, during which he stood on the stand “smirk”.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present at the meeting.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan “Army and people – one hand”, which was chanted by hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to restore the powers of the president, whose office was stripped by the military council that took matters from the deposed leader.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as it is accepted, he fulfills the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Tyumen Region Mechanical Engineers Association was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of the company Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welding pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the factory profile and install equipment for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, which allows to increase the assortment.
The factory produces both a small profile pipe, which is used for the carpet-personal household, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in plans to purchase new equipment - an increase of personnel by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the already existing ones.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new steel longitudinal cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another condition, with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing and utilities.
The management of the enterprise sets the task of closing up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing to the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of mechanical engineering enterprises.
This also includes forms of state support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission to review the subsidisation contracts will accept the documents from the companies by November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.
Up to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, since the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the mineral production tax, which the oil companies paid into the regional budget.
At present, they do not and subsidies become the region ' s direct spending obligations.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers direct support to industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders have expressed concern about the current situation in relations with the oil industry.
The subsidy on the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete with the price of the middle band of Russia, where the cheaper labor force.
In addition, it is unclear the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which has not yet placed its orders at Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and applications for its extension have not been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Uvatsky region will be received into the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist role in the social network
The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a resident of the city, who posted on the social network a video of extremist orientation, RIA Novosti reported on Friday a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page in the popular social network video, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
In relation to him, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at incitement of hatred and hostility, as well as at the humiliation of human dignity committed in public".
"The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a punishment in the form of 240 hours of compulsory work," the agency's spokeswoman said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians the collapse of the prices of goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
This will also mean that prices will have to go down.
"This applies to goods that come from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should be no price increase either.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that association with the EU is a rise in prices, it is not quite so, or more precisely - it is not so," Azarov concluded.
Investigators are checking information about the abuse of a child in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that the educator of one of the kindergartens of the city of Biska for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Investigators are currently figuring out all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment to the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of insanity, Yevgeny Vasiliev spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyev, to whom the attention of the media has been tied for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about both the thefts in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with the former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and about the price.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of “Oboronservisa” violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information regarding the former Minister of Defense."
I was blackmailed into testifying or I'd be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We'll go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of victory.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that, perhaps, most of all, Vasilyev said that it does not matter with taste.
It is probably meant the statement of the official representative of the SC of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which collected the figure of the case of "Oboronservice", were found fakes.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the mistress, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expert appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes,” Markin said in early October.
Some of the paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I have bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just an indefinite limit,” Vasilyeva says.
When asked if she admits her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes she is accused of, Vasilyeva said: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today’s statement by the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is avoiding the investigation of criminal case materials, the lawyer of the defendant stated that he and his client “do not allow the investigator to get acquainted with the case materials”.
What was the reason for the revelations under house arrest Vasilyeva, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps, how could a woman not be able to answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the Komsomolki journalists right, who claimed a couple of days ago that she “fell into even more trance under house arrest” because of news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family’s bosom?
The well-known military observer "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "Followers do not rule out that after such a shock she can become more talkative at interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took on some charges of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.

Do you think travel agents have gone into the past thanks to the Internet?
In the company Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects its main full-year pre-tax profit to be $325 million to $340 million, compared to a previous forecast in the $305 million to $315 million range.
If current benchmarks are met, this would be a 12-17 percent increase compared to the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre made 8 percent of its profits in the first half and started the second half with good figures, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and for some of them a record high profit is expected for the full year before deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, the leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre’s leisure business was doing well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her U.S. business has compensated for losses sustained during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, the shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents to $ 38.20.
On October 31, Barnaul police identified two gambling halls.
The first worked in the Industrial District on Vzletnoy Street.
At the time of the inspection, there was a game.
There were 24 cars in the club.
Another gambling club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
Twenty slot machines were used here.
UMVD of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials on the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling" have been prepared.
The tech's out.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who brutally assaulted two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after the fire extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralskaya street, found the bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
The identities of the victims were soon established.
It turned out that they are sisters, one of them - a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The apartment burned down a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies work out different versions of the murder, check the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose women rented an apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar.
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British literature beginning in 1914.
The exam will also feature “non-programmatic texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with strong recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curriculums in English and Mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
The separate regulatory body in the area of OFQUAL exams will present a revised structure of secondary school graduation exams, with a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to regain public trust,” insisting that school graduation exams would be “more complex, more ambitious, and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students work about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on a math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school mathematics graduation exams combined with an increased coefficient in the rankings table will likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training on the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe tourists will start to carry ships on the air cushion.
For those who want to travel to China, this means additional expenses.
A ticket on a cougar is traditionally much more expensive than a boat.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
The passage through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season the tickets did not travel: at the same price the cougars drove tourists and last spring, and a year ago - autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia's GDP growth rate is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
This year we planned to increase GDP by 3%, maybe even a little more.
It will be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us this is not much, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business get normal loans at normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

A trip through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking in hundreds of patients.
In this West African country, there are not so many doctors – only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of CNN’s top 10 heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to become CNN’s Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall back into unconsciousness, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that resembled itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said George Bwell.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
A lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would be out of pocket.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the health care costs in this country are private.
“The only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 other people are stuffed into vans, tied to roofs medical supplies and drive across the area to visit those in need of help from the village.
They don’t always have luck.
Many times they had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are met like real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that only the locals can offer.
The free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwelle with his wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates—documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, municipality, or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to free up space for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operational and sanitary treatment of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an indefatigable pace, but the dedication of the brigade usually helps to support the village musicians.
“They’ve been drumming all night so we can stay awake and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia treatment he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Kathy O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O’Malley coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity for practice that they would never get at home.
“We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medication.
But upon arrival in Yaounde, their food, transport and training pay Bwell.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, a near-constant workload is not a hard test.
Helping to live a happy life for others, to fulfill the promise given to his father is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this so that people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden has agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretapping
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebel met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Prosecutor General’s Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by US special services.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knew a great deal.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makey at a press conference following the meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Akhmet Davutoglu, reports the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the public administration bodies of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other,” said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, following which the protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the areas of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, new forms of energy, and energy.
“The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented and I am convinced that the current minutes will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners,” he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that during the talks, the heads of foreign policy departments of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, should be increased and brought to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And all the necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will be created,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to talk about health care
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday went on the heels of his often-repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified of the termination of services by their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama slightly revised his original public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “revival in the news” about the end of services, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it shouldn’t surprise anyone that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage doesn’t meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been “horrifyingly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
I want to restore your trust.”
Irritated Sibelius overturned this phrase, which was caught by the included microphone, sitting behind her assistant at yesterday's hearings in the chamber after a heated debate with House member Billy Long, a Republican from the state of Missouri, about whether she herself is obliged to join the program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The agency "Rosbalt" deprived of the status of the media for an uncensored fight
On October 31, the Moscow court decided to recognize the invalid license on registration of the agency "Rosbalt", - writes "Lent".
Roskomnadzor insisted on the deprivation of the status of the media agency - for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing the publication the right to make counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Information Agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened its second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognized private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, “Rosbalt” has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive publications of the agency were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the closeness of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was said that the head of the project was Natalia Chaplin - wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplina’s role in the leadership of “Rosbalt” is not completely clear: she is most often called “the project manager”.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citations nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of visits to Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes of the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Joke", pogroms in the capital Birulevo.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, which prohibited journalists from indiscriminate fighting.
The agency found the banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Gigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated the oil rigs").
The following pages describe it differently.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the found videos, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and appealed to the court with a request to withdraw the license from the agency.
Rosbalt stated that the claims of the department are incorrect: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the parent words in them were masked, and, third, immediately after the warning the videos were removed from the site.
The agency’s representatives appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims to the world court – and when the Mosgorsud accepted Roskomnadzor’s claim on 22 October 2013, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already on the 25th, the world judge made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each film.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow court - if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been prejudged even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the statement on behalf of the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 signed 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CPRF).
Vsevolod Bogdanov, the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Pavel Gusev, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, and Mikhail Fedotov, the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, said of the illegal closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that the case will not come before the revocation of the license.
The court over “Rosbalt” showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a media outlet in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroys chemical weapons equipment <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
By November 1, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisons for use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the poisons are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time – not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons – and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian claims will be scrutinized by Western intelligence agencies.
They will be willing to advise inspectors of new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a matter of the hands of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership – in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia – destroy or decommission all the capacities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and for filling the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be the destruction of the Syrian army’s existing chemical weapons.
It is assumed that this arsenal can contain more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisons, skin-splitting mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable for action for the first time - it takes two weeks.
OPCW Field Operations Director Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors were “personally watching the destruction of the equipment.”
“They no longer have the ability to further manufacture or mix chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the factories for the production of shells and poisons were either destroyed or put into disuse.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was “particularly difficult,” as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, the time to celebrate this has not yet been found by the inspectors - they were too busy with work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. spying “went inappropriately far”
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of U.S. surveillance defense tactics by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases, U.S. espionage has “went inappropriately far.”
The secretary of state also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was guilty of being “on autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden’s loud revelations about the NSA’s spying activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually perceived some things happening on autopilot because such an opportunity has already existed – both during World War II and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, September 11.”
He then became the first senior U.S. government official to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone unfavourably far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a feeling of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good motives and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, explode people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to find out about those plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the U.S., the Senate subcommittee on European affairs chairman said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Murphy, a first-time Democrat who serves as chairman of the Senate’s subcommittee on international relations for European affairs, in an interview with the Washington Post.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger about these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other disclosures included documents released by Snowden that showed the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended spying on the Allies as necessary and said it was a normal affair on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office is organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators are expected to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the travel program is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help improve the relationship, he said some degree of “hardness from the best of motives” would also be manifested.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spying programs they have used for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry must travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the problems of hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new composition of public observation commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new composition of public observation commissions (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
INCs are public bodies that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhayev, the unrest in the colony of Koper - it is through the ONK that most of the resonance events behind the grid get publicized.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists of security forces for control of the ONK.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the ONC, I proposed making the selection of human rights experience a criterion.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed without developing the criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev - the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders engaged in prison problems.
As a deputy of the State Duma from "Yablok" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OP Council must vote for the composition of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than 1,000 candidates applying for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donation for vacant places.
The IOC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borschev, in the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes to 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital commission.
However, the representative of the “Fighting Brotherhood” Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the IOC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, by appointing their chairman of the IOC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of security forces is coordinated by member of the ONC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on a rope track," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies that he is lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list is now voted in the OP.
The publication of Borshchev's information he considers a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONC.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year’s Copa’s unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the Rostov-on-Don ONK can go from human rights defenders to security forces.
Out of the new lists, the human rights defender "lost" the chairman of the local commission, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
Lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers the "muse for Kopeisk".
The revelations of Hope Tolokonnikova did not affect the IOC of Mordovia, which is considered "forced": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the contest.
OP Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favour, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the preparation of the lists of the ONK Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of FSIN.
Gryb told RBC daily that he does not believe it is right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions have enough authority to obstruct the work of its members.
Mushroom does not take to predict the results of the voting of the OP council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman files appeal against jail term in Thailand <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bemford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of filing a false claim after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after a break-up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bemford for two days before she admitted that she had fabricated the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bemford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term at a general regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a women's prison for adults.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
The Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously it was a worrying time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bemford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently vacationing in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources reported that Bemford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court increasing her sentence to up to two years and forcing her to serve an adult prison term.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Recall, this is his novel became the finalist of four awards: "Clear Polyana", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the award of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard, built on modern life material of stories and stories causes hot disputes among critics of different directions.
It can be argued that the collected articles on the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand by the word “literature”, what they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not include most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in the abbreviation in the sections "Paragraphs ..."
