A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially proved promising in the field, but formal studies have shown less effectiveness than hoped in preventing deaths.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a means of control, i.e. scientists used it as a reference and compared it with the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need on the part of the Olympic community to strive to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has stated, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by carrying out a significant change within our organization, and not by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has promoted an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described with so much courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides greater detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur plumage is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rickets, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the rickets are probably the result of evolutionary development following such characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chicken feather.
According to the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult-sized plumage and not that of a chick.

Brightness is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the number of Rossbys, the lower the activity of the star compared to magnetic reversals.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction force on Earth that generates tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to debunk that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that “normal” matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a sort of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

The government has also promised several million vials of vaccine against encephalitis, to ensure that next year health facilities are not unprepared.
Vaccine delivery plans in the historically worst-affected areas this year have been delayed because of a lack of funding and because they have been given a low level of priority over other diseases.

Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: “Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground.”
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the chosen candidate.
After verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988 the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of the voters are entered, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to assist at every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers perform the calculation of votes under strict control, in accordance with specific procedures.

This morning the head of public prosecution, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Mr. Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in government by Mr. Ed Davey MP. Mr. Norman Lamb MP is expected to fill the role of Minister for Enterprise left vacant by Mr. Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court is scheduled for February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and the driver, 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla has sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, he is blind from an eye, he lacks a skull section and his face has been rebuilt into titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two single championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the race.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's group of the category "sit", with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first ranked, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place Gye'ung.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police were able to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her mobile phone and her laptop".
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, Adekoya is at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing his own son.
She is detained pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be contaminated, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system has other parameters, as the Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos to be potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “Journalists who post photos or other suspicious subjects walk on mined land.”
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for the court proceedings, has specified to journalists that no new comments will be released at least until the formal act of indictment.
According to the leaked document, the subject of the document will be the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such presence for only five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program, NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly took an oath in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “absolutely depreciable.”
The earthquake shook the Mariannes at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported to the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After completing her training in obstetrics, she entered the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving in the hospital, in his spare time, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight records.
His wrestling teammates also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, exactly like her. A strong woman."
"Moon was weird like me...maybe even more...I love her and I'll miss her...We hope she's in a better place," Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia’s transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, interim prime minister Julia Gillard said he believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents say that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he accused several disorders that caused him to doubt his fitness.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, or matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he put his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing more than "chickens and political idiocies".
A candidacy for the presidency is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than outdated ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking on site.
Fears related to the absence of the means of transport have raised the possibility of having the game played necessarily behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, USA, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic Darwinian fringule, Geospiza fortes, and the gilled gills.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin wire, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into foil.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
It is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the juice of red cabbage it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been ripped out of electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, put them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewerage networks have been discovered.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public baths, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partly distorts the light and the visual.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-living domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows him not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large cats), even with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of howling and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (preds) thanks to the smell, spinning on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then plummet them on top.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island, thus making it difficult for them to return), they will likely find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to stand as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his age and therefore he feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
From his long jaws emerged more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus a further row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it is possible that he had the bifurcated tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for several strange or unusual occasions, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together lying on one side while they ate their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Mystery of the Templars,” you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measured 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be laid down.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only affixed as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive was called Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
“Civilization” means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is, citizen, and "civitas", that is, city or city-state, and in a certain way defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being so recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on the often uncooperative state authorities for the enforcement of its acts.
It did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles needed the unanimous consent of all the states, who, on their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
Almost 7,000 islands are part of Japan (the largest being Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors transiting from there soon recorded the name of the island with the name of Formosa Island, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that involved the production systems of aboriginal cereals and hiring Chinese artisans to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 thus relinquishing Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It still occurs today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was entitled to be examined.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European states for over a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power has affected everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the Church’s monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain was undermining international waters to prevent any boat from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and effervescences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to earn a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if one knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has not yet come to ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, hosts numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arc up" resembles a V and the indication "arc down" resembles a scratch or square without the lower side.
Upward means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it results in a stronger and more decided sound.
You can decide to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the archery signs you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in the grip of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young sons (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they made their way back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds oscillated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 A.D.).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that the fate of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the framework of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time the customs, customs and culture associated with that geography have emerged that, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similar to Paris, now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of biological type, that uses preserved seeds originating from the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures share individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures differ according to the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who have grown up without proper socialization with adults due to neglect, failure, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "virals" or savages. Some of them have been segregated from people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally bred by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small Microsoft Office graffiti assistant.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt, and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are entrusted for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nutrition, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that the affidavit represents a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The rent is supposed to meet all the unsatisfied needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and express variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in a way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery from sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice using a relatively silent wake-up call to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (lighting energy) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the split between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, from mercenary armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved obsolete, however, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral, international treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time opposing the same ability of the enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is represented by the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it did in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually reared in herds left free to move on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Wagons were built in England in the 16th century.
Despite being simply made of parallel wooden axles, the wagons, when compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the period, allowed the horses that ran through them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 they made their appearance the first rails completely in iron.
The first means of transport known to man were the legs. Humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upstanding man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
In order to try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and we can also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, today known as "The Dunlap Manifesto".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the post was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 known Dunlap borders are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many people tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that they share with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of coded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check that the label contains first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both the murderous bed bugs and bed bugs are nests, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) causes about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases that affect young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are twofold compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides in fact most of the scientific investigation.
But it’s not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations helps guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relatively to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting the natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and getting to know the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small country to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic andirivenii, all are somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why do they get rejected every day? Are they designed by engineers who are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to stand out from the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small infestations to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeras.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don’t have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Rio delle Amazoni is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Rio delle Amazoni river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and the waters of thousands of minor tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of the size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These are in fact more like the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and they never have to approach a tempera matite.
We can only wonder what fate will have the keyboard when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the functioning of the fission bomb.
In practice, it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill, so by further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the furthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the rise of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are centered on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and drive them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most common content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to direct their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put disciplinary actions into practice, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire operation of the team and do it himself.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
For what reason should an organization have the will to face the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you can effectively use all the resources available in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is at the heart of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that can’t be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by the technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of the museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poorly curated grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "encourage students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them". The need to feed public interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the evocative and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the opinion of foreigners.
The vast northernmost areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness lands.
If you do a population comparison, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent of its own.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that all declare that they are married, regardless of the actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it as the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookah and a lot of pottery, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's roads, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document yourself well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a wedding-wedding (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu ended up becoming an exotic and distant land metaphor.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In PBS's Henry Louis Gates special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which gives sustenance to a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development has focused on the heavily populated reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal band of mangroves. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to have 400 Bengali royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trenches have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group that lived in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were seminomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and U.S. dollars.
It is likely that on the peripheral islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a lower temperature than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meter from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meter from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: buffalo, elk, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining a proper distance. It is necessary to leave to these animals a suitable space since they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous 1889 naval blockade, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the trees of pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a bit 'busy, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can take a bath safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australians and New Zealanders might be better off taking the trip.
The tap water of the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, the bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. The 'expresso' is black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and injuries to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask for advice from the authorities, follow the instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear them and tend to stay away.
The saltwater crocodile habitat consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer inclusive breakfast packages, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and gain a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, since crossing the ice causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to explore the city. Passengers on cruises are granted exemption from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything possible to increase the time and money spent by their guests. In general, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests’ moods up so they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered from the house. However, the state of intoxication alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you can’t drive like when you’re on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time to keep you stuck.
Even precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the hub of many visitors’ vacation.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to trips made by land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes scary, so you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first of which was held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among themselves, however, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while regular tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are found to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, in addition to transmitting poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to purchase duty-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers headed to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the coverage level of the mobile phone service is much higher than that found in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German oven cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich-tasting desserts, you can orientate on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, curry in the inland regions is commonly used for yogurt; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the rider’s feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet remain blocked.
If a youngster is jumped by a horse but has a foot embedded in the bracket, it could be dragged by the horse running away. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially those of the English, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are blocked.
Peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Free-diving snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very common and involve sliding on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts multiple enthusiasts, sometimes also referred to as "ski bums", who devote entire periods of holiday to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings with the depiction of human skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on the skis: the activity is also called off-piste, skiing mountaineering or hiking on the skis.
It is connected, although usually does not include them, to skiing touring or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat more than those covered by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus obtaining a saving of time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact a piece of antiques. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences with respect to the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America with respect to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived on fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in the S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the territory of the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of trip cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Aversive weather conditions" is the general term used to refer to any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social distress or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, higher than normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to storms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal high-intensity weather phenomena include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of adverse weather conditions that affect their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a potentially significant country as a war zone, must support professional training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using hands-on experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travelers who are planning a surgery to change sex abroad must make sure they have the valid documents with them for the return trip.
The intention on the part of governments to issue passports with no indication of sex (X) or up-to-date documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections of security controls also became much more scrupulous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The ripple currents consist of the return flow of the waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths are due to fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, returning to swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescues, based on your abilities and whether you have been sighted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes have difficulty re-adapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is how much more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a volcano still active filled with water of origin to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, because to call you have to find yourself outdoors with the view clears up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to your home country.
Usually, enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
There is no need for a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Nautical is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground you will not need a separate visa (from 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, in addition, the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or on not being in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class, the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox one.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smirne spreads over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the city breathes an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church sanctuary, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions celebrated all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived in these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made them work to death, whether Jewish or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or about the Nazis.
Avoid misrepresenting these places by smearing structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by almost everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and conceited.
Although it is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris is still to behave at your best, relating yourself as a "well-educated" person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The harsh exterior appearance of Parisians will fade quickly if you show off some good basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mostly beech, pecci and spruce, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster, along with several other animal species more widespread.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stables for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants all the way down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "You" used for the courtesy form that stands for "You", always begin with the capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing quite complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in a different way: expensive means well-loved, while carriage means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the times regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
These days, pre-modern observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit a garden in Italian, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you to move away from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy to tour city; you can buy pretty much anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place for the patriarchs of the Bible, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inside of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of hiking trails and well-known cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands arrived there by swimming, flying or swimming.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals were unable to face the journey. This made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
In the Galapagos were introduced numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats after the arrival of man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
The office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the well-being of their superiors about every decision, and they are expected to stick to the instructions without asking questions.
