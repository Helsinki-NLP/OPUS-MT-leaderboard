"MG Baltic" case: new Gustavinio lawyer says he has not yet been able to get acquainted with the case material
At the 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday, all the defendants met: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the accused.
At the last court hearing, the state-appointed new lawyer Alexander Doroshev told the panel of judges that he had not yet been able to access the case file.
Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, a lawyer at MG Baltic, said that in order to ensure full personal protection, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to access the case file and asked for the court hearing to be postponed.
"In order to ensure the protection of a person, he must have access to the material of the criminal case.
It’s not just a formal sitting,” Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The new lawyer A. Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev noted that he was unable to get acquainted with either the indictment or the entire file of the case.
Before that, at a previous court hearing, Gustainis, the suspect, announced that he would abandon his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The lawyers of the accused are angry that the audio recordings submitted to the court are of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated favorable decisions for the company in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the decision of the winners of public procurement, recalls the ELTA.
The pre-trial investigation interviewed more than 150 people, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 surveys were conducted.
Gustainis is suspected to have received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 bribe, Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys - more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>27,000. E. Massiulis is suspected of taking more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106,000 bribe.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and influence-trading, the Liberal movement is suspected of bribery, influence-trading and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of the purchase and influence-trading of these parties.
It is suspected that the policy on bribes consulted with the vice-president of the MG Baltic group, R. Kurlianski, and later suggested or supported initiatives favorable to the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Guardians of Ethics: Board of Liberal Movement on the Right to Conduct of the Vilnius Department
"The decisions taken by the government are in accordance with the statutes," its head Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas told BNS after the commission meeting.
“Our decision was not a new one.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when the issue of Pag<0xC4><0x97>gii and Utena was raised.
Then we said that according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence of the board.
And if the board decides that a department can do what it wants - go with the committee and the board approves of it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision that all the departments form parties.
And if you do not meet with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the party's board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17th, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party cancelled the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with the list of the newly elected election committee.
According to the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, decisions of the board.
Until October 31, the Vilnius chapter had to cancel the aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn’t do that.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Au<0xC5><0xA1>rin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already left the Liberal movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, promising to seek another term as the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
Municipal councils and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Villagers in northern India drove a tiger to a tractor that had previously killed a man, officials said on Monday.
Forest watch officer Mahaviras Kaujlagis said the tigers later on Sunday toppled a man who had worked in the fields, surrounded the beast, and drove it to the tractor in an attempt to escape.
Residents say that this tiger about 10 days ago also attacked and infested one young man.
The village is situated in the Dudhva tiger reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the capital of Uttar Pradesh state Laknau.
Galabyti tigers are prohibited in protected areas.
Security Director Ramesh Pandey said the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Utar Pradesh state beat another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Protection Act, tigers are considered a endangered species.
Last year, government data showed that at least one person died every day in the past three years from encounters with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflict with tigers has been on the rise since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection program, which established a national park sanctuary and began to criminalize the targeting of big cats.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the censuses show that the then population of about 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Cats and dogs are required to be labelled with microchips
The Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips and their registration and labelling should be organised by the local municipality, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - even cats, so the population will not be worried and the costs will be covered by the specially provided state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price for the provision of microchips and services, which will reach around EUR 5, all pet owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling of all animals can reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million annually.
It is envisaged that the funds for the labelling programmes will be allocated through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenues this year as a result of the increased redistribution of taxes and funds on natural resources.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the practice of mandatory labelling, which is common in almost all countries of the European Union, makes it possible to protect the animals themselves (because they can easily be returned to their owners if they are lost), and has saved the time of the producers of the animals themselves, when a large amount of time has to be devoted to the search for a stray and stray pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges us to take responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
The previous proposals for mandatory labelling were met with resistance as the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the public.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased incomes in the environmental protection support program and the right to label by granting not only veterinary doctors, but also publicists, i.e. individuals of animal welfare institutions, who have heard special courses in the project," the authors said.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas factions - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
A spokesman for the provincial governor, Arif Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were injured during the attack on a joint army and police control post in Choghan district.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed in the three-hour battle with Afghan forces, and another ten Taliban were injured.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid released a statement to the media in which the movement claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Gazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Morning" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the FIBA European Cup fourth round match will take place at the Vilnius Ryto arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
Dwikova will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Warm relations with the Ukrainian basketball team will be welcomed by the team of Cherkasy Cherkasy Mavpy and Prishtina KB Prishtina on November 7th under their roof at the Ryto arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were not able to hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," said Maksimas Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from Vilnius.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team after the first round takes third place with one victory in three meetings, and the Kosovo team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be very important for Group E, as only two teams will enter the next stage.
In the past, both the Ukrainian and Kosovo national teams competed in the selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship in Vilnius.
The 100:61 victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball enthusiasts will be able to enter the match on Wednesday for free, and the start of the duel is at 7 p.m.
"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobait is persecuted by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-haired actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> is once again getting roles related to the lies.
At first, the series "Women Lie Better", then the play "Lies" and finally the comedy "Lies".
In this film, Brigita plays the square wife of the hero of Song Kazlauska.
“I really liked to film in Lies, because I’m more of a theatre actress and I rarely make films.
A wonderful team of colleagues from the very beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I’ve never been a fan of these small, decorative “fifa” quatrains.
However, during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and finally I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully," the actress smiled.
The new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" was produced by the producers Paulius Virbickas and Stasys Baltakis from the very first minutes of the comic and intriguing adventures of the family members. The new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" was produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys..."
Your loved one just announced - she's waiting.
That would be great news, but... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Unable to announce the "good news" to everyone, the parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such a feat.
Not all heroes are what they looked like at first glance.
In addition to B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97>’s comedy “Melagiai”, the four-time movie stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Luubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gediminas Girdva are in a good mood.
Comedy "The Lies" - in the cinemas since November 9th.
Decides whether to write off <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in unpaid taxes for emigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday agreed to consider an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of the Living Place prepared by the "peasant" leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis.
56 Members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will then consider the amendments on or after 6 December, after receiving the Government’s conclusions.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years, one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such people.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys lamented that in this way the Seimas would "call on some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no fees would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a member of the Conservative Health Committee, noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment when paying a small health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as the residents who pay this fee.
The amendments provide that those who leave Lithuania will be considered as those who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area countries or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the head of Sodra, has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of emigrants and Sodra’s activities.
A video posted on the Internet about a sliding teddy bear reveals a serious problem
As the mother of the bear climbs a straight snowy slope, the baby keeps climbing, slips down and again a persistent copy.
The video has received a lot of views and comments.
People admired the persistence of the little bear - he repeatedly slipped down, he was back at his mother's.
He succeeds not at first, but the baby does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is a real eye-opener, but it also reveals the threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to get to know wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"It's clear to me that the bear drone was very scary.
You can see from their movements that they are panicking.
If there were no drones around, they would probably have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," environmentalist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones work with bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
When the drones were approaching, some of the bears were running away, others were not running anywhere, but all of their hearts began to beat more often from fear.
Scientists advise drones to use animals for filming responsibly, not to fall too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The president was contacted by the newspaper.
The Kiev court on Tuesday invited Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to attend a trial for his alleged treason in an unusual way, a call was published in the state's official journal.
In a court summons published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a criminal trial session on November 19th, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to participate in the meeting by video link.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced the conclusion of the debate in the case of Yanukovych.
Yanukovych's lawyer, Alexander Goroshinsky, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers by November 19 so that he could attend a meeting where Yanukovych is expected to have a video connection with his last speech.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia through a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula, which belongs to Ukraine, and a war between Kiev-backed separatists and Russian-backed separatists began in the east of the country.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of some 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure long-term ceasefires.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of Conservatives to the Vilnius City Council
The Conservative candidate for the year has already been approved by the former Minister of Economy, parliamentarian Dainius Kreivys.
At the weekend, during the primary elections of the Conservatives, the party members rated the list of candidates to the Vilnius City Municipality Council.
As reported by the party, V. Benkunskas, chairman of the TS-LKD Vilnius chapter conference, became the leader of the Conservative list.
The first ten candidates were Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adamas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kien<0xC4><0x97>, former Member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives’ League Arduin Mannskas Bentas.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will be held on March 3 of next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants complained to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CJ) the decision of the rulers to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) of the Seimas announced that the group of Seimas members had turned to the Central Committee of the Republic of Lithuania to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties with the Constitution.
"Parliament stresses that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste incineration plants that are already being carried out, by instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km away from the residential area) before the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas for the construction of waste incineration plants," the statement said.
"Parliament notes that, in view of the way in which a prohibition on the construction of a waste management site is formulated in the law, the prohibition on the construction of a waste management site does not involve the imposition of a country's State property (i.e., the definition of a 'residential area'), it is concluded that the prohibition is disproportionately restrictive or even unlawful.
The application states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The KT has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards according to an indefinite criterion.
When such a legal regulation is established, the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law, are violated,” the petition states.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
If the current projects are stopped, the state would not only suffer hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses and the inhabitants of Lithuania - the heating prices would increase, the pollution of the environment would increase due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The petition was signed by members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic factions and Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, a senior member of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Party.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>, which envisages the right of the Government to stop the construction of cogeneration plants that have already begun, and also set a limit of 20 km for the construction of such plants.
The amendments to the law, which have been re-adopted by the Seimas, will come into force from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to suspend already started projects is not planned to be waived.
KT will examine this case in order - not earlier than a year later.
LeBron James Reveals His Stats at the Lakers
LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he expected, the organization and fans of basketball.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start has led to rumors of the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
Still, such speeches were calmed by the president of basketball operations Magicas Johnson, who said that he will not forgive the coach, but it is necessary to play better.
The biggest star of the team, L. James, should also turn to himself.
Although the statistics of the striker are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 effective pass.
But she does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other figures have also emerged, showing that the Lakers play better when there is no L. James on the pitch.
The striker does not like +/- statistics showing how many more points the team throws or misses when there are certain players on the pitch.
While L. James is on the field, the Lakers have spent 30 points more than their rivals this season.
When he was sitting on the ground, the "slugs" earned 19 points more than the competitors.
Currently, the Lakers are in 13th place at the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region," Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air policing and air policing reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter destroyers were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai was in May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>o: I believe in the innocence and protection of the law
"For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, perhaps, the services are doing the work they have to do.
We all do our own work.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no dishonest actions of his should be done," - said V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>.
A<0xC4><0x8D>a was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the Raseiniai municipality administration, took a high-value bribe, and in exchange could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipality's bus company Ra<0xC5><0x86>as.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly buying R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a or participating in the masking of bribes in various financial transactions.
The Raseiniai District Municipality Council dismissed R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as from the position of head of the administration in April this year on the third attempt after the expressed distrust.
The former "order" in March of this year became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilos, he suspended membership in this party on Monday.
A few years ago, A<0xC4><0x8D>as unsuccessfully ran for mayor as a representative of the election committee "Tavo Raseiniai".
A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy for mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether to participate in municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian Peasants and Green Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she is waiting for further law enforcement action - it will depend on whether she will withdraw from work in the commission.
“I’m not going to make a decision this week, I think I’ll make a decision.
I will see, if there is a need, what charges to make, of course, I will make one or the other decision.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - everything will put time in its place," she said.
Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97>, the representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, called on the Seimas President Viktoras Pranckietis and the leader of the “peasants” Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis to separate themselves from the statements of her colleague Vida A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
She claims that A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>’s further work in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would “cause public mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission”.
Sensual "Coldplay" music interested and famous Lithuanian couple
Many music and film lovers gathered for the premiere of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams on Monday night.
The event was attended by all kinds of famous people: Jonas and Simona Nainia, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain’s most popular pop bands, Coldplay, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
The documentary’s director, Matt Whitecross, met the band’s guys back when they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen viewers.
You can see pictures from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or free time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later - and drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released their first record, Safety, which contained three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, the majority were distributed to radio stations, producers, and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety went on sale.
Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums with over 100 million copies sold.
Over the past two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy Awards.

He scored 19 points and won 9 balls.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 utility points.

J.Grantas, the Klaipeda Nept<0xC5><0xAB>nas striker, who played a powerful match in Vilnius, also came to the top five.
The American threw 25 points in 25 minutes (10/11 doubles), won 4, took 3 balls and thus accumulated 29 utility points.
This appearance of the legionnaire allowed the clowns in the capital to triumph against the local "Morning" 78:66.
The greatest incidence of influenza - in one of the major cities
The incidence of influenza and acute upper respiratory tract infections (UTIs) declined across the country last week.
According to the Center for Communicable Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), on October 29th to November 4th, the total incidence rate of the Lithuanian influenza and Avian Influenza was 49.9 cases in 10 thousand inhabitants.

Palestinian man stabbed to death by Israelis on West Bank
The military "has blocked the way for this attack because it identified a terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) officer," the Israeli army said in a statement on the incident at the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron.
“Kary set fire to a terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not harmed,” the statement said.
A spokesman for the military told AFP that the attack was carried out by a Palestinian.
After the incident, the video footage shows that he was not seriously injured.
A wave of similar attacks by Palestinians began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but it is rumoured that a new wave may arise.
On 22 October, a Palestinian was shot dead by a knife attack on a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments by European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate conditions for foreign imports.
At the opening of the trade and investment forum in Shanghai, Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed that, given the signs of economic slowdown, the overall goal of Europe and China should be to "unify efforts to stop the spread of protectionism around the world" by applying a "substantial increase in trade wars" that would lead to "increasing competition".
"For the European Union, China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
She stressed that the transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements - this must be an essential issue for the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China’s import exhibition is trying to soften criticism that it is avoiding opening up its market and protecting only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50%, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>820 million.
Some officials are concerned that China’s investments in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing’s exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is tearing apart the unity of the EU.
Disadvantages to solve: mobile signature service is already in operation
The Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, a mobile signature provider, reports that the mobile signature system malfunction has been removed and the service is operating as usual.
The mobile signature started working again at 2.28 p.m.
The mobile signature system crashed on Monday at 9.52 a.m.
These failures were experienced by customers of telecommunications companies Bit<0xC4><0x97>s, Tele2 and Telia.
The cause of the SK ID Solutions malfunction has been identified, but is not disclosed for security reasons.
The company apologizes to consumers for the inconvenience.

The cause of the crash of the Lion Air plane revealed: relatives of the dead infuriated
Data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air indicates that there has been a malfunction of the speedometer on at least four of its last flights, the researchers said on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) said a similar incident occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fatal one when a liner crashed in the Sea of Java on October 29 just after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board the plane were killed.
A number of media outlets reported irregularities during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed of the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Tjahjono told a news conference.
"The data from the black box showed that on two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta there was the same problem," he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social media.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (the data is left) about four flights, during which there were problems due to the air speed meter," - said the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with the family members of the deceased, Tjahjono said that the information of the recording device of the flight data corresponds to reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight of the plane had changed in an irregular manner.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said that after a technical malfunction was detected on the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport, Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials supervising the search for the remains of the plane and the victims, as well as the investigation into the disaster.
However, he got up and bowed his head when angry and soul-stirring family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, who founded Lion Air in 1999, present themselves.
“Lion Air was acting inappropriately,” said one man, posing as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane was flying.
“I want Mr. Rusdi Kiran and his team to pay attention,” he said.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any compassion."
After this meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long process of recognition of the dead.
Police medical experts were handed over almost 140 body bags, loaded with parts of the supports of people.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives asked why the airliner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although there was a malfunction during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which, among other things, led to the sudden descent of the plane, which frightened passengers, immediately after taking off.
Lion Air said that this malfunction has been removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked one of the sons of the deceased.
- If not, the appropriate technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not say that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond in accordance with the law, so that the plane crash in Indonesia will not happen again.
Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris had spread over a fairly small area showed that the liner was likely to have crashed into the water at very high speed.
“The plane was in one piece when it landed at sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the engines of the plane, when it touched the water, acted in large turns - this shows all the broken turbine blades," the official explained.
The Lion Air plane crash is Indonesia’s biggest aviation disaster since 1997 when the Garuda plane crashed near Medan killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers led the rescuers: the victim and the minor
On Monday evening on the road V<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>ai<0xC4><0x8D>iai - Plung<0xC4><0x97>, near Accidents cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz".
The car collided with a man, three people are reported to have been injured.
It is reported that a BMW driver, born in 1999, drove on the opposite side of the road, and a cockatoo crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car, which was driven by a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz had her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
The Presidency: no artificial easing of the referendum is needed
After the Seimas approved a proposal by the ruling party to reduce the referendum cartel, which currently has greater protection for the first section of the Constitution, the president will amend the veto, says her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97>.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that's a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It is not difficult to predict that the president will really veto," Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>, an adviser to domestic politics, told <0xC5><0xBD>ini<0xC5><0xB3> radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic elements of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore reducing the necessary number of votes to replace these articles, according to Ling<0xC4><0x97>, would create a "negative precedent" and "would not open up".
"In the president's opinion, there is no need for any artificial relief, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people," he said.
The Seimas is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on an amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote approve it in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution by a referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
The proposal came after the Seimas approved the presidential veto in September on amendments previously passed in parliament that eased the requirement for the number of votes to change citizenship in Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to reduce the cartel in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, it should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Immigrants after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, currently, with some exceptions, cannot have dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community of the world seeks dual citizenship, but is afraid that under the current conditions, a referendum will not take place - not enough people will come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", so they need to be updated
Lithuania’s airport and road infrastructure is starting to crumble, so it needs to be upgraded, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
“Air transport infrastructure is already a mess because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We have to update the Vilnius airport - this is not even part of the long-term planning, it is the minimum that we have to do," Mr Masiulis said at a transport conference held by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we must complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipeda, arrange airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, already start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,” said the Minister of Transport and Communications.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
“The situation on the roads is still not improving, because there is insufficient funding.
We expect to build new roads, but even the essential maintenance, such as on motorways, is lacking.
We have to set the amount that should be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Mr Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport services exports grew by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market was Germany, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis has once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers be required to return tractors to the country of registration on a regular basis.
“We need to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd to suggest that tractors should be allowed to return home at all times, because empty trucks, burning fuel and increasing emissions would be the driving force in Europe.
Most of this will be achieved by the railways, because the costs will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with Heritage Guardians
Last week, Mr. Masiulis informed the Seimas Economic Committee about the start of negotiations on the change of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - this would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis called the discussions of Mr. Masiulis a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixth decade of the last century is a value, entered in the register in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"Extracting that old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step in order to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal to make Vilnius feel like a modern country, rather than an interesting one, really unrepresentative of our country as innovative," he said last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also announced that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport with the "Rail Baltica" line, building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026, after the completion of the construction of the Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Next year, direct flights to Madagascar will start from Vilnius
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger plane "Boeing 767" flying on regular flights will land at the airport of Vilnius, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, based on the information of the travel organizer "Itaka Lietuva".
It is announced that passengers of Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be accessible directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, General Director of Itaka Lithuania, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
The new holiday travel directions for the summer season 2019 have been prepared by other travel organizers.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to prepare for tough times.
What I want to be happy about is that for the third year in a row, we are accumulating reserves for the first time in Lithuanian history.
But it is also a very important thing not to talk about the disease," Shapoka said in Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> participates in the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting dealt with issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or are planning to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to tax the revenues generated for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as non-compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has made use of this option.
For more information please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: options for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the ESM functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
It has recently been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and landscape artist Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>nai County, then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai Governorate.
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-sustaining national revival brought many Lithuanian people, including their brothers Bura<0xC4><0x8D>us - Bali, Jona, Broni<0xC5><0xB3> - from the very depths of the countryside to all creative powers to participate in the development of our cultural traditions.
B<0xC4><0x81>lys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, who spent more than 50 years travelling around his native country with his camera in his hands, presented a broad and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing blocks of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, Lithuanian landscape, castle hills, everyday life and holidays, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a considerable part of the Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D> legacy, devoted to the description of national working customs and related traditions and, most importantly, to their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupations.
In the manuscript of the book there are extremely rich descriptions of the works of interwar <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija, especially the Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>kians, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kians, as well as the works of the inhabitants of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kiai, their festivals and other traditions and customs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>.
Out of the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs have been selected for this publication, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are characteristic of the Kupichians, Dz<0xC5><0xAB>ks, other districts of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija.

Tragic fate of the couple: died just after a few hours of marriage
A newlywed couple died in a helicopter crash just hours before they were married in southwestern Texas.
William Troy's Butler, 24, and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steve Kennedy.
The strange thing is that the accident happened after flying about 24 kilometers, just as many newlyweds were years old.
The 76-year-old pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The couple studied at Sam Houston State University, located in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi and after the wedding party flew out with a helicopter belonging to the family.
The accident occurred after the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The brides-to-be flew to St. Anthony's International Airport, where they planned to board the plane and fly for the honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
“It’s a very rugged, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high,” Kennedy said.
G.D. Lawrence has been piloting the family aircraft for many years.
According to Kennedy, he flew helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be made clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
Its wreckage is seen with a wide beam on a rocky hill slope, and the body remains “dangerously suspended,” National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) flight safety researcher Craig Hatch said at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators plan to take out the debris and then inspect it thoroughly, but it won’t be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that location, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined and the preliminary NTSB report should be published after two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister Calls Entry of New Sanctions on Iran ‘Historical Day’
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his Likud party's parliament, his office said.
“Today is the day when under President Trump, the United States imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran since the beginning of the effort to curb its aggression,” he said.
Israel's Defense Minister Avigdor Lyberman said on Monday that the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls “the toughest sanctions of all time,” came after Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program, which was controversial.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran’s oil exports, which have already plummeted by about a million barrels a day since May, and to cut off Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of the sanctions has enabled Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow it to establish itself there militarily.
Other parties to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the U.S. decision, saying the deal, as planned, has so far prevented Iran from buying nuclear weapons.
The court again narcotic the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
Upon the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern city, the court will hear the testimony of the witness after the accident.
The Vilnius District Court decided on Tuesday that in order to find out all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26.
In this case, a justifiable sentence has already been issued, but the prosecutor’s office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius city district court acquitted the driver of the car of 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, who said that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius County Prosecutor’s Office asks the district court to overturn the district court’s ruling and claims that the accident is the main fault of E. Osipov and the district court’s conclusions are unfounded.
A lawyer for the family of the deceased motorcyclist is also asking for the annulment of the sentence.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015 at about 3 pm, when the car driven by Osipovo “<0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia” from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>nai Street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>nai Street and collided with a motorcycle driving on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the rules of road traffic, which are intended to give way, and caused a traffic accident - a man killed on the main road motorcycle "Piaggo".
Initial police reports indicated that the driver of the scooter had died, but later after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equivalent in power to a motorcycle.
Vilnius city district court judge Rolandas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas BNS has said experts have found that the motorcyclist was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permissible speed at that location - 50 kilometers per hour.
“The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would run at such a high speed,” the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the vintage car claimed to have driven at a speed of only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The motorcycle driver, who had seen the crash, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before crashing into the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, had to give way to the motorcyclist.
"Novaya Gazeta": six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian military personnel and six people belonging to the Vagner military company.
This is reported by the Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian military corps is located in the said territory, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" have joined.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry with a request to provide information about the fate of the Russians.
The former King of Belgium will have to take the paternity test
This decision is a partial victory of the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a brief romance decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to the station RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to a DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the former husband of Delphine's mother, is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
For the relevant investigation, Delphine applied to be recognized as the "real" daughter of Albert's father.
Will distribute money to the parties of the VRK, but will not give anything to social workers
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to allocate almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million to the largest political parties this week.
This spring, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Parliament’s Vice-President Gediminas Kirkils, is yet to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be granted in the near future by a separate decision of the CoR, if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityte, President of the CoR, informed V<0xC5><0xBD> that "this Thursday is the scheduled meeting of the commission, which is planning to adopt a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly budget grant to the parties".
According to her, the ECJ must take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary parties, are expected to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Democrats are expected to receive more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.2 million in the E.U. government, less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.2 million in the E.U. government, less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.55 million in the E.U. government, less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.5 million in the E.U. government, less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.4 million in the E.U.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which will guide the CoR in distributing budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
The party has not participated in any elections so far.
True, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the coming elections next year, even for three elections - the local government, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to the laws of the political parties and this year’s budget passed by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the ruling party, Mr. Kirkil and the leader of the Peasants’ Green Party, Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, claim that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the president’s objections.
However, it will not be possible to do this until this Thursday’s meeting of the CoR, so, according to Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityt<0xC4><0x97>, “grants will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed so far”.
However, the head of the CoR did not reject the fact that if the Seimas rejects the veto of the president this or next week and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties takes effect, a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, may be considered in the commission.
"In making the decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive body that has to implement the laws that we have adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties, having additionally borrowed the corresponding amounts.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: the perpetrators of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and there are more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked in accordance with the examination procedures.
As president, I don’t have the opportunity and I don’t have to get information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement agencies must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most concerned that Handziuk’s murder would be clarified and that the killers, crime organizers and perpetrators would “take the necessary responsibility”.
“After this case has been reclassified as a murder, they are absolutely right and reasonably at risk of life imprisonment,” the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public’s demand to investigate this case openly and impartially.
Poroshenko stressed that statements by law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the government is determined to hold criminals and murderers to account, whoever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on the subject will not help to clarify the situation, and even more will confuse everything.
“I call on all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to use baseless arguments and, God forbid, not to use this assassination for public relations,” he said.
- On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so as to build public confidence.
There is simply no other way.”
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country," he said.
Handziuk, who fought corruption, was attacked and acidized in the city of Cherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of the southern city of Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko issued a resignation statement on Tuesday after police and prosecutors failed to explain the perpetrators of the attack.
After her death, officials were accused by public activists of failing to properly conduct the investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am submitting my resignation statement today," Lucenka told members of parliament as she read out her report.
Parliament has yet to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenko accused activists of pressuring the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk’s murder.
Bill Gates has introduced a toilet without water.
In presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to a water-free one to the 1980s computer revolution.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has unveiled a high-tech toilet in Beijing that doesn’t need water pipes, according to Reuters.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilizers.
“The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years,” Gates told Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the help of a charitable foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the course of seven years, work was done on a device that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water, for which the fund spent $200 million.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
Now the machine is finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is willing to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation conditions around the world.
Fighting poor sanitation issues, such as cholera and others, is increasing spending on health care, which already amounts to $233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates goes to the toilet to present a glass jar with faeces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in the small example "there can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs".
S. Slyva elected president of the Association of Mass Football
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian association of mass football took place in Kaunas, where Sergejus Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Following the request of Anatoly Stetsenko to resign as president of the association, an extraordinary general meeting of members of the association was convened.
It was attended by 13 of the 15 members.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates participated in the elections - Sergei Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
11 members of the association voted for S.Slyva, two members voted for V.Rastenis.
S.Slyva will end the term of office of A.Stechenko, which will last until January 2021.
Worry in France: People's deaths are a cause for concern
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide, raising concerns about several dozen people being poisoned in the country's west recently.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide was taken after a new safety check, launched earlier this year, at least three years before the outbreak of poisonings in the Department of Art and Luar.
As a result, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes are used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Anjou region, where many lettuce juices are grown, complained of eye and throat congestion, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not hasten it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told Ouest France on Monday.
Metamo, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe, is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to be a "probable human carcinogen".
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
“There was no choice but to take him out of the market, regardless of whether he had alternatives,” Weber told the paper.
“We understand the difficulties that will arise for lettuce growers, for farmers in general, but public health is more important,” she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government’s decision last month to halt the use of landfills in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce juice consumed in Europe each year is grown near Nanto.
The next season will be "much less salad dressings, radishes and pairs", after the government halted the use of the shot last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nanto growers' federation, told AFP.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million invested in the shopping centre with an overview wheel in Tallinn
Next weekend in the Estonian capital, a new shopping center "T1" is opened, to which the local real estate development company "Pro Kapital Grupp" invested 70 million euros.
A total of 130,000 square meters, or 55,000 square meters of leased space, will operate in the shopping center of 150 shops or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, the developer said in a statement.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Acropolis" (combined with the area for offices) amounts to about 110,000 sq. m.
"T1" - the first shopping center with a review wheel installed on the roof, says the developer.
It will start operating at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: next to the tram stop, intercity buses will soon run.
The main rail terminal of the Baltica is also located nearby and is expected to serve about 1 million passengers per year in 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global business of shopping malls is undergoing fundamental changes, and in the development of T1 managed to find itself in front of them.
“We have created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experiences that are not available online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a gateway for travelers, an impressive and worth visiting object and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a statement.
Great attention to entertainment.
According to the manager of the shopping center, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltics.
A total of 12,000 sq. m, or one-fifth of the total rental area, is available for entertainment.
Exceptional accent - a viewing wheel is installed on the roof.
It will lift the guest to 120 m above sea level - Tallinn's higher only TV tower.
After the tour, on the fourth floor, there will be a shoe park "Super Skypark", which will open the largest shoe center in Europe and the first basketball and net on the shoe square in Estonia, the company says.
In an interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center, children are promised to occupy at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and the chairs moving according to the rhythm of the film, the feeling of reality will be enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema room.
According to the developer, the opening of the "T1" is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by 13 million euros per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange as well as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania and suffered EUR 350,000 in losses, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 million of sales revenue and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 million of net profit were generated on the Lithuanian market.
The shopping center "T1" was built by the Estonian company "Merko Ehitus".
Cameroon's President Paul Biya sworn in for the seventh term after controversial elections
During a ceremony presided over by the Speaker of Parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, aged 85, Biya promised to protect the “unity and unity” of the West African state.
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7th election, garnering 71% of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biyo’s inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were kidnapped at a presbytery school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are carrying out an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon’s population of 22 million are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North-West and neighbouring South-West Province, in response to dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in the fields of education, the judiciary and the economy, autonomy began to be demanded.
In 2017, after Biya refused to resign, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of the Amazon", and took up arms.
According to non-governmental organizations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed this year in separatist attacks and counter-terrorism operations.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border into Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in semi-detached forests.
Only 5% of voters in the North-West region voted in the October elections, while 15% of voters in the South-West province voted in the October elections.
In both parts of the country, Biya won two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative Primary Election: Mistakes Caused by Inexperienced
"When something is missing in places - understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed to use their premises, but not everywhere there was a voting booth, because we can not buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who borrowed it,” he said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not malicious in nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections were experienced - this was news to them as well.
Therefore, not all of our actions were consistent with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC to respect the principles we described.
These complaints, however, do not constitute grounds for doubting the results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas said.
According to the President of the CRC, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been stamped - upon learning of this, ballot papers found in ballot boxes without a stamp have been cancelled.
In some towns, there was a lack of space, but according to Anusauskas, complaints and violations related to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference of several thousand, it really does not make a substantial difference to the election results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas explained.
It is claimed that the party members’ turnout in the elections was 55%, while the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
The two candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on the committees.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - 79% of voters (16418 votes) voted for Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imionyta, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygaud U<0xC5><0xA1>acka.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support the candidacy of I. <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> in the presidential elections in May next year.
Trump Says He Won't Meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will take place this week.
However, in his last rally before the midterm elections, Trump told reporters that he was not sure if it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the president said.
However, the White House chief added, the two will meet during the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" after that.
Trump is still trying to "overwhelm" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia interferes in the 2016 US presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas asks to annul the VTEK decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, former director general of the Santara Clinics at Vilnius University, has asked for the decision of the Supreme Commission on Ethics in the Office of Internal Oversight Services to be overturned - it has been recognized that transactions have not been declared in a timely manner and the law has been violated.
Mr Strupo’s complaint was examined by the Vilnius County Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the VTEK of 23 May, the BNS informed the court representative Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97>.
Mr Strupas believes that the gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he argues that he understood the exception to the law.
In May, VTEK announced that then-removed General Director of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97> violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation, it was found that four transactions were declared in breach of the envisaged deadlines: a loan taken from the bank in 2010 with the spouse, the purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and in 1996 together with the spouse was granted and not repaid.
S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> has also declared these transactions to be past due dates.
Persons who have violated the law on coordination of public and private interests in the civil service may not be promoted for a year.
The law obliges to declare not only your own, but also the spouse's data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of TV information from Info TV.
It is explained whether K. Strupas and his spouse, Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republic University Hospital of Vilnius S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> properly and in a timely manner declared their concluded transactions.
Last year, according to Info TV, Strupas gave his daughter a real estate worth 125,000 euros.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinics and his wife did not mention their interests in the statements.
Jurist K. Strupus, along with at least ten other persons, has raised suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to the law enforcement, for winning public computers, software purchases in clinics from companies demanded illegal financial compensation, it is disguised as support.
In this way, Mr. Strupas is suspected of having been arrested at least five times during public procurements in the field of information technology at the Santara Clinics.
K. Strupp himself denies his guilt.
In September, Professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was fired from his post as head of the Santara Clinics.
With the decision of the Ministry of Health and the University of Vilnius to terminate the working relationship with K. Strupou at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
The Santara Clinics will continue to be managed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the competition to elect the new Director General takes place, it is promised to be announced later this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Changing the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
Speaking at the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> said that in the last ten years, over 30 million euros have been invested in the updating of educational content, but the results are not visible.
"According to the results of the international student achievement survey PISA, the achievement of students is below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in a statement from the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge, not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuanian general education programs, a lot of attention is paid to the literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility of students, but it is also necessary for children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy to develop.
Presenting the changes in the content of general education, the Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said that the scope of the programmes launched in this academic year will decrease, they will be more specific, the disciplines are more closely linked.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of students will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of assessment of students will change to an accumulation score, greater weight will be gained and the competence of the student acquired in an informal way.
Decreases in standardized tests.
It promises that the general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve the achievement of students in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reduce the gap between the achievements of students by a third, to provide students with modern competences acquired at school, and to be written in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million in EU and state budget funds to update the content of education from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of general education programmes updated in the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in some schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism for the almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 million project being carried out by the Centre for Education Development to update the general programmes of primary, primary and secondary education.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million is planned for the four-year period, with the first <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3 million purchase announced at the beginning of October to look for developers of education programmes.
After the experts criticized this purchase, he was suspended, the Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> dismissed Giedri<0xC5><0xB3> Vaidel<0xC4><0x97>, Director of the Center for Education Development.
In Lithuania - exercises on how to respond to extreme flooding
In Lithuania, a ten-day exercise to improve the institutions’ response to the extreme flooding begins on Monday.
As reported by the Department of Fire and Rescue (PAGD), the exercise will examine the extent to which state authorities are prepared to work in the country after declaring a state-level emergency, such as a flood: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from the besieged areas, and to ensure the release of energy from the besieged areas.
The exercises will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions, as well as members of the emergency operations centers of 12 municipalities.
On November 5-13, the preparatory phase of the exercises will take place, during which the municipalities, receiving information from the Hydrometeorology Service of the PAGD about the continuous rainfall and the beginning of the flood, will take decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active exercise phase is scheduled for November 14-15.
During this period, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department, and the state and municipal institutions will operate as emergency operations centres for the institutions.
When a state-level emergency is declared by the government due to the consequences of the flood, the Prime Minister-designate will lead the operations for the eradication of the emergency, its consequences, the protection and rescue of the population and property.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, deputy director of the PAGD, said that the key to the exercises was to check the institutions’ readiness to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities for exchange of information, to check how the authorities, state and municipal authorities are prepared to warn and inform the public about the impending disaster.
The exercises will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire rescuers to pump huge amounts of water from the besieged areas.
For this purpose, the module "BaltFloodCombat" was established in 2009.
Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko resigns
Ukraine's attorney general, Yuriy Lucenko, announced his resignation in parliament on Tuesday in response to the death of Ukraine's anti-corruption campaigner Catherine Gandziuk, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, a request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, and this - to provide the Supreme Council with a majority of votes to approve.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General J. Lucenko presented the progress of the law enforcement investigation on the order of K. Gandziuk murder and the results in the Supreme Council.
In his speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk’s death was being exploited for politicians’ public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her native southern Ukrainian city of Cherson.
On July 31, an unknown assailant K. Gandziuk was spitting acid in the face at her home.
On 4 November, she died in hospital due to injuries sustained.
Protesters at Ukraine’s Interior Ministry demand an answer to what killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix reported.
According to Mr. Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 persons who may have been involved in the order to kill Mr. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the study.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leak of information, the suspects received essential information from them.
Lucenko added that he had met Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were exploiting her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has any reason to say that someone is acting in accordance with the authorities, I want to say that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to consider this issue in Parliament," the Obozrevatel newspaper quoted Lucenko as saying in the Rada.
Lucenko added that "it is impossible to allow the country to become a bi-state when the law enforcement system collapses without any evidence, even for revealed crimes."
Lucenko is considered a close ally of the country's president Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top-level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy <0xC5><0xBD>. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
According to Energy Minister Aurelia Vernickait<0xC4><0x97>, the meeting will focus on achieving renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not reach the EU-wide trajectory of the cumulative national renewable energy action plans - it accounted for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
According to the EC, progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including rather high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took up the issues of the proposed corruption investigation to supplement the conservatives’ appeals to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday approved a proposal registered for an investigation into the illegal influence on political processes by Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, and nine parliamentarians abstained.
The draft will be discussed further by the Seimas Committees, the main one appointed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>’s Law and Legal Affairs Committee.
Upon receipt of its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
Currently, the Seimas Interim Commission of Inquiry, which is conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to interpret the possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
<0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed to extend this term by stating that "significant information appeared in the public space about the possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions".
<0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> describes the project as "possible representation of pension fund interests in the legislative process or by referring to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Central Commission on Official Ethics".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling “peasants” found that conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension funds’ lawyers in their appeal.
Under the influence of the Central Commission on Service Ethics (CEC), the leaders of the "peasants" accuse former comrade Povilas Urb<0xC5><0xA1>i.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas State Management and Municipal Committee could instruct the members of VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Department of the Commission Mindaugas Siauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas constituted a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, the impact on the electoral process, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, parties and public movements, the governance of the legislative processes, and the governance of the public administrations.
It is also proposed to examine the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities, how they responded to it.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
There will be an election campaign for the President of the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of "peasants".
Its members also appointed two social workers, one "order", a liberal and a representative of the Union of Christian Families of the Lithuanian Polish election campaign.
Conservatives and Social Democrats have refused to participate in the committee's work.
The new study was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, president of the ruling Lithuanian Peasants’ and Green Union.
According to him, a study carried out last session by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) showed, in principle, that the study should be continued.
The head of Germany's internal intelligence service has lost his job.
Maassen, 55, has fueled controversy by saying he was blamed for his troubles by a “radical leftist force” in Merkel’s coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced into reserve.
Among other things, it emerged last weekend that Maassen had criticised Merkel’s “naive” immigration policies at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "disappointed him personally".
Seehofer, himself under pressure from both the dispute and his party’s poor performance in the Bavarian local elections, has asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to put H. G. Maassen in reserve.
A shark attack scares the entire island - a third person has already been bitten
The Queensland ambulance service said in a statement that the victim had suffered "serious leg and wrist injuries" during the attack near the island of Sid Harbor off the coast of Queensland.
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
Succession Island is the largest of the archipelago’s objects of the same name, attracting a lot of diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks in the region have so far been relatively rare.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time a shark was attacked was in this islet in 2010 before the last shark attack.
VRK has two new members - Viskonta and Puksa

Obscure girls ruin stereotypes about wedding dresses
Chubby girl with a white puffy bride dress - mission (not) possible?
Can the white swan floating towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Plus size reality show "The Evolution of the Big (r)" participants already today will prove that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the kilograms of a woman.
But that's not all - one of the girls of the project will shed tears of happiness tonight - on the set of the film will appear her boyfriend.
“There are also those who think that bigger girls don’t get guys’ attention or looks.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me for who I am, he doesn't require me to have a figure that meets some standards," - before the show with the wedding dress, participant Aurika will speak.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, clothing - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable to move.
Also, some women believe that the older girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident in herself.
I can reassure you that a properly selected model of the dress really solves this "problem" - explained one of the members of the show commission, the fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
In the project, R. Kalinkinas decides the fate of the girls together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagli Bieranc and TV producer Laura Pauk<0xC5><0xA1>te opened a plus-sized fashion house.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of quirks between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was further complicated by the fact - I can now reveal - that there were two newcomers who were certainly no worse than the elderly.
It was a special evening in every sense,” Kalinkin said.
Novak<0xC4><0x97>s – 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show famed Ieva and 31 year old mother of exceptional beauty of two children Dovil<0xC4><0x97> – as well as other girls participated in the selection of the “Big (r) Evolution” and entered the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls on the streets of Vilnius city, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK viewers, who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
Having received international recognition, the reality show of the embodiment of beauty in Lithuania is already taking place for the second week - here plus size girls compete for the first name in the country plus size star.
So far, there are only eight of them - and they all understand perfectly well that the winner can only be one.
Intriguing and unpredictable reality show "The Big (r) Evolution" week begins already this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. via LNK.
Actor I. Elba has been voted the sexiest man in the world.
People magazine has named the sexiest man in the world this year.
He was the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected when he told about the new title, he did not shy away.
I thought, "You can't be!
Are you serious?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I look sexy - laughing at the sharing actor.
Speaking candidly, Idriss stated that this title is an extremely pleasant feeling, which flattered his ego.
The British star believes he has often received snarky words and insults, which made his childhood difficult, because, as he puts it, he was "very tall and unattractive".
The young actor did not impress his peers and became an object of ridicule due to his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“I’ve just healed your mustaches and become the toughest guy in my city district,” Idris smiles.
When a man loses his pride in the screens, I. Elba works as a disc jockey at parties held in Spain, and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a passion for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor claims that his family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world to be elected by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death during drinks in <0xC5><0xA0>irvintai district
On Monday evening, a man was fatally beaten during drinks in the village of <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>ki<0xC5><0xB3> in the <0xC5><0xA0>irvintai district.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m., a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during drinks.
The doctors confirmed the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was arrested and found to be 2.53 years old.
The police explain the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer require a distance of 20 km when building waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is located near the Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nai Market.
Managers no longer aim to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements when building waste incineration plants.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the "peasant" faction, having previously supported the provision on the 20 km distance, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika’s amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built according to statutory environmental and public health requirements.
He acknowledges that the amendment has prompted the president’s doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of residential area, it is obvious that such a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," the committee chairman said.
In October, the ruling majority opposed amendments to the president’s veto that tightened the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the Government to make decisions on the future of two plants already under construction, taking into account the public health interests.
Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika does not propose to amend the latter provisions.
The energy group "Lithuanian Energy" is building a waste and biofuel power plant in Vilnius, while in Kaunas - together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum" the company "Fortum Heat Lietuva".
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
We are talking about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Ireland’s leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on a difficult Northern Ireland issue that is straining Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the so-called Safeguards Agreement mechanism, which would allow the border between the province of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which belongs to the European Union, to be left open.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal, but has ruled out any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation, Th. May "made it possible to review the mechanism of safeguards," he said.
"The interlocutor has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review does not involve a unilateral decision to terminate the application of restrictive measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators find no acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain pulls out of the single market and customs union next year.
The two sides agree on "security measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain’s unilateral withdrawal from the Safeguards Agreement in three months’ time.
Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"The three-month or limited-term security measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information about the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations after a report appeared in Britain over the weekend that the agreement was reachable by hand.
“I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done,” May said.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize Laureates Call for Access to Reliable Information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, released a statement on Monday calling for the right to access reliable information in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), a Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), and Nobel Laureate Mario Labe.
“We urge good-will leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make decisions based on facts,” the group said in a statement.
They argue that “the global information and communication space” is a common good that “must be protected in order to enhance freedom of expression and expression.”
"People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated based on the principles of commitment to truth, the principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding," the statement added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “fake news” but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should express their position on the issue when they meet at the "Forum of Peace" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories urged.
This declaration was prepared within two months, under the leadership of Mr. Ebadi and Mr. Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deloire), the head of the Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom and journalist rights advocacy organisation based in Paris.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Dioufa, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said about the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because the entities that have paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations", - said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after approval by the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, empower market surveillance authorities and create a clear framework for product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, producers are currently under no obligation to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities have not been granted the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month time limit for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to establish an infringement, to conduct an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did so.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability, so that market surveillance authorities could facilitate clarification of suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access the market, the territory, buildings, premises of the economic operators who produce, supply products to the market, to carry out inspections, to carry out state controls on the safety of products.
It is intended to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 (now 144 to 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed the dangerous goods on the market and on the distributor who supplied them to the market.
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>868 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,344) would be imposed on the State Consumer Protection Authority (CPA) or another market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria a fine of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (minimum fine not specified), in Belgium - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>26 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600,000, in Romania - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>155 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>666 in B.
10-year-old boy has been raped by family member
The incident in Colombia has shocked millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby sees the world thanks to the cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For some time they were looked after by doctors.
It will take some time for the young mother and child to get out of the house.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, the little girl became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - a brother," the director of the hospital where the birth was received told foreign television.
Police are investigating the incident of rape and violence against the child.
The Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and remote areas of the country.
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO’s exercise “Triangle Link 2018” – NATO’s largest exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from Norway’s second military battalion after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan – that is, in the warm countries.
But most of all, they have been able to fight in the Arctic, and these skills are of particular use now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the remotest and harshest areas, soldiers have taken part in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in a harsh climate they have to put on a much heavier weight - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers in charge say that with their skills, how to survive and fight in such conditions, they share with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which resemble real warfare like no other, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

The Vice-President of Kaunas does not plan to return to politics
Povilas Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis, a former deputy mayor of Kaunas, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business because of his support for Vygaud U<0xC5><0xA1>ack in the presidential elections.
“I want to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy spending more time with my family," said Matziulis.
He also said he was not planning to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis has not yet had a chance to speak with U<0xC5><0xA1>acka after losing the primary elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyte on Sunday.
“If we’re open, we haven’t been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
It is obvious that after Vygaudus withdraws from the further election fight, this stage of my life is over," said P. Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas for support of U<0xC5><0xA1>ack, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost its unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations".
Mr. Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis briefly served as Deputy Mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to this position after the successful elections of the "United Kaunas" in 2015.

Workers in Kaunas Castle: What are they doing here?
The Kaunas people, having noticed the workers floating in the Kaunas Castle, hoped that the reconstruction of the tower that has survived would finally take place.
Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>ied<0xC4><0x97>lis, the director of the Kaunas City Museum, told the portal kauno.diena.lt that the work of changing the roof of the protective roofs of the south-western tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is taking place here.
According to the spokesman, the roofs will be tins.
"The canned coating, worn out by the state of emergency, posed a threat to those around them - people could have fallen and been injured - and so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also detrimental to the heritage," the museum director explained.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All the work is in harmony with the heritage and other institutions", - G. Su<0xC5><0xBE>eid<0xC4><0x97>lis added, aiming to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time important and practical side - roofs must protect the values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas Castle were covered with tin in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical values," the director of the Kaunas City Museum explained.
The contract of employment was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the works will not take longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the museum's director said.
According to him, the value of the work is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was provided for in this year's budget.
Work in Kaunas Castle is carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. diena.lt has written, as according to the studies carried out, Kaunas Castle may have looked earlier.

There are 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion."
On Friday, North Korea threatened to renew its nuclear program if Washington does not lift economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be “seriously considered,” the North’s foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on television that the criminal measures would remain until Pyongyang renounces its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

The Eastern European Study Centre will work with two major US brain centres.
According to Lina Kojala, Head of the RESC, which is based in Vilnius and has been operating for thirteen years, the US will be able to implement projects and make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint action.
I have no doubt that niche activities will occur, because the topics of development of NATO, security, disinformation, Eastern Partnership countries are also priorities for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the RESC and the US authorities will work together in the preparation of applications for international projects, will exchange expertise and knowledge, and will prepare expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost one hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest ranking of global analytical centers of the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work in the highest political institutions in the United States, ranked 10th in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality cartel," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the support of partners in the distribution of the soon-to-be-released RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among decision-makers in the US and in the public domain.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of ongoing projects and does not maintain targeted grants.
Among the RESC partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

Two people were seriously injured after two buildings collapsed in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire department said.
When buildings collapsed on the street, debris burst, and dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters were at the scene near the famous old port of Marseille, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture posted pictures on Twitter showing a pile of rubble and wooden beams, a huge gap in the place where the buildings were standing, fire engines working at the scene, and cars covered with a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who might have been trapped in the rubble.
The Marseille fire department said on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
In the amateur video, which was shown on BFM-TV, passers-by can see the dust clouds in the street and the gloved mouth.
In the Google Street View photos taken before the incident, one of the collapsed buildings was five, and the other - six floors.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, plastered with windows, with large facade cracks.
Sabine Bernasconi, the mayor of Marseille, said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used by people living there arbitrarily.
The prefecture of the region urged people to avoid that place and to free up the way for rescue services.
Sabine Bernascon, the mayor of Marseille, said the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.

Mexican Restaurant Helps Deported Migrants From U.S.
The further away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and these are hardly able to adapt when they return.
“When I was deported, everything was taken away: the house, the car, the clothes.
They took everything except one thing – my knowledge,” says Victor Hugo Hernandez, restaurant director.
The restaurant board hopes that the combination of Mexican and U.S. cultures will foster a better understanding of each other.
A member of the Afghan Special Forces shot an American instructor during training.
North of Salt Lake City, 39-year-old North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor has taken a year-long vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the United States Army Headquarters, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the U.S. military, whose name has not yet been released, was injured in Saturday's attack that killed Taylor.
Officials said Taylor had died from a firearms attack.
The commander of the Utah National Guard, Major General Jefferson S. Burton, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army's capabilities.
Utah media cited a NATO report that Taylor had been shot by one of the trained special forces soldiers and that the attacker had been killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains were to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in the state of Delaware on Monday evening.
He has previously served two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was his second.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors from the battalion of one of the country’s special forces.
Hundreds of residents of North Ogden gathered in the streets of the city of 17,000 to escort their mayor, along with a card accompanying the family police.
B. Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
