Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village car park was put into operation in Gutach - in view of the older city hall traffic light.
Two plants so close together: Intention or Shield Burger Strike?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The City Hall lamp was installed at that time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secured both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e junction area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"In the case of the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another light had to be produced for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach daily on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another lighthouse is more than necessary: "Security is simply here", says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were held, a roundabout was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested at the location selection of the traffic lights: "By means of a transporter specially loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks, we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without tipping over the traffic lights".
The approximately 15,000-euro bulb plant itself is the "modernest that there is currently on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that are so bright that the lights can be clearly seen by the drivers, for example, even in the sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“If a group or people with disabilities cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone gets safely over the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think about this as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the traffic light to pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle rumbled through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the inclination to crude violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and displeasure - the Carinthian poet has often described.
The B<0xC3><0xBC>chner prize-winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which allegedly is copulated and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a wealth of directorial insights, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, their heads submerged in water, their evening robes tacked to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or mieder, they stack on dangerously high stakes through the staging, either monologue loudly or lie completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates itself in this strained way.
The best moments of the evening are when you sing - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
It is only towards the end that the overturned performance comes to a head, and Winkler’s absurd humour flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit in the dashboard of any car.
The devices, which record every kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of financing U.S. roads.
The normally rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles traveled – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress can’t agree on an approach, several states don’t wait any longer.
They are currently looking at how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per driven mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles traveled by all California motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, funded from taxes paid by Americans at the tap, is bankrupt.
In America, however, not as much is thought of as in the past.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent at high alcohol prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not future-proof,” said Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel recorders to test a miles-based payment system.
“This is the most viable alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behavior in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally-enforced climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Marketers of the Reason Foundation are also interested in the idea of having drivers pay for the route.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the attack and responded to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering this as well.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently exploring how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical that the government could pursue any of their movements.
“Worrying about Big Brother and things like that was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the travel recorders into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the miles traveled, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally set up to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging car insurance market where drivers are expected to pay based on the miles travelled.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to get involved if their speed and locations aren’t recorded,” Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage, said in a statement.
Major mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance has to be paid only for driven kilometers, and speed data is collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” a city planning document says.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials explained that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsfeld: Small team is waking up
The volunteer fire department managed its autumn main test despite personnel shortages with bravery.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
In his acceptance of the exercise, department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
There is supposed to be a short circuit when sawing.
Two people were injured due to the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two breath-guards of the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and guide them to the open air.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
Furthermore, there were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing operation was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via a superfluous hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now it was possible to design three release attacks.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what can be achieved with little available staff.
In case of emergency, support is provided through the K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsfeld daily task force.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, President Guido Wolf also asked himself in Titisee-Neustadt where the workforce of tomorrow comes from.
In the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he worked with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the district high school and the chairmen of the parent advisory board on this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, which presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration between the F<0xC3><0xB6>rderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in W<0xC3><0xA4>lderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
“It is important to keep an eye not only on the family phase, but also on the care of family members due to demographic change,” Wolf said.
He also said that more and more people are taking care of their families.
“Without the support of employers, the resulting strain on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship,” Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, especially important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned about the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, the regional economy often remains, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the National Assembly said.
Because only if enough training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Continue to be persistent and make sure that public transport improves," he said at the address of the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were hosted in the rest area.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Joseph.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
With popular melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich interviewed.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old school yard before the renovation to Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen.
In the days before Kilbig, during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, a small corner wall was installed to stabilize and statically relieve the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger Stadtbauamt, the next step is to include the State Monument Office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation should be made by experts, which should then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on new substructures.
The historic one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old school yard to Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, however, the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A fixed wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use the schoolyard, which has been done through the current fastening work.
Originally, the school yard renovation was planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses caused a postponement.
An important word in the historical renovation of the school walls, which has even been used for film recordings, the National Monument Office will speak with you.
Should regulations come from this page, then the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen hopes for grants from the conservationists.
The students of the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new classroom, can soon use the old school yard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic education at the Music University of Stuttgart," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classical belong together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
This contradicts <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
After that, among other things, the course of study Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. Border: 'Super-Tunnel' Discovered for Drug Smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use, according to the information.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where the tunnel was discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term battle against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the tunnel’s elaborate equipment, the investigators assume it was designed by architects and engineers and took around a year to build.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access to a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for confiscating marijuana.
All three are facing life imprisonment as a maximum penalty, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, according to a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the detainees, at least one of whom was Mexican, it said.
You have to expect prison sentences of up to 10 years.
2014 will be Geisinger's year of celebration
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in just eight weeks, the anniversary year will begin.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first documented together in 794.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in churches-houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Churches-Houses will be 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a party, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this holiday weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21st, together with the Black Forest Society’s Sunday celebration, on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on September 27 and 28.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle is also released.
"But it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipzigerdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the current space with the congregations was completed.
The new chronicle will be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Foolish Name Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has the banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipzigerdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipzigerdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in a deed of donation, which is in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which was then a courthouse.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250th anniversary in 2014 is also 40 years behind the municipal reform.
Council takes aim at railways
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
For this, Schiltach has to take in the hand 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings should be increased - there are regularly collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate in the costs with a third, the rest are shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's town builder Roland Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel world west of the railway tracks.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those that transport lumber, could stand in the middle of traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp with his statement brought the mood of critics to the point: "Do we have to take in so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transportation.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route, because the up to 20 meter long vehicles could not use the route at the H<0xC3><0xA4>berlesbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since it is to be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the costs of the planned widening of the road investigated.
Despite this, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing, with the provision that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city can expand the subsequent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e" if necessary for meeting traffic to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg".
The administration had had the reconstruction plans of the railway examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg would then be possible without further delay.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not possible to rule out that the inclination of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit.
The responsibility for this is again borne by the city as a road construction load carrier.
The restructuring may therefore result in liability disputes.
Since both the removal of wood and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other rail crossings, because there is a middle stop right next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains coming from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to the point where there would be no risk of collision.
For the most part, the approval of the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bath out" the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction works.
The board considers the conversions at the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway, to be unproblematic.
Esa Decides on Large Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Faraway planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
Thirty proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
At least some of them are alive, no one knows.
The choice is hard: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or wander to Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to significantly advance research.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were up for debate, five of which have now come to the narrower election.
Numerous committees reviewed the proposals, following in the footsteps of the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the program "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars – are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To address this issue, the Cheops Space Telescope is set to launch in 2017 to study 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for “biomarkers”: gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide information on what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter", ESA has already approved an M-class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is expected to launch in 2017 and closely observe the sun’s surface and activity.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, ESA plans the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into existence and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter known to us, consisting of stars, planets and living things like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through whose actions the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With Euclid, Esa has already approved an M-Mission, the launch of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chance of obtaining a permit as an L-mission is "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
This includes changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could make it, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
In contrast to systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to survey cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder".
Proposals have already been made for the transport of samples back from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no attempt is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment filed by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany are strained by allegations that the NSA intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said he should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele said that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden speaks in Germany, then he needs assurances that he is “safe” there, according to the MP.
Snowden said in his letter that he was exposed to a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home.
However, he is touched by the worldwide reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a credit to the public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Frontier Airlines charges a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers wishing to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers were likely to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small pockets under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the airport.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to avoid these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take one piece of luggage free of charge at the Frontier airfield, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before arriving at the airport.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee will only come into effect in the summer, an exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have left the fingers of charges for hand luggage so far.
Three years ago, Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage, and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit carry-on baggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the airport if passengers were to face the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in aviation in my career,” he said.
I expected to see toothpicks and hand-gripping discussions at the airport.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running like grease.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade, or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the entire can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had tried briefly in 2008 to demand money for soft drinks, but did so again seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontier’s step of charging for carry-on baggage if passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to purchase directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to allocate only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles in.
Passengers can also book seats exclusively for direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base based in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under control as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
Some 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house were "Words from the Bible" and "Words from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita K<0xC3><0xB6>hler, the chairman of the church council, gave a lecture on the biblical proverbs.
“Words contain life-wisdoms, rules, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs to the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: "Let the eyes of wood be watchful, like scales falling from the eyes, let them cast an eye on someone whose eyes the Lord gives in sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
Several times the speaker also had her listeners guess what the proverb was.
Christel Dehner, the church councillor, adopted the medieval saying: All good things are three, make blue, do something haughty.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
In the end, a tombola was saved.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for unlearned people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry will be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Gastst<0xC3><0xA4>ttenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA Says ‘Internal Error’, Not Hackers Are to Blame for Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that an error had crippled its public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight as an internal error occurred during a scheduled update," the agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No Such Authority), has now found itself working in the light of the public and, according to the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad, is subject to sharp criticism – a result of the secret N.S.A.
The growing controversy over the intelligence community fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without jobs fell slightly by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the rate is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the office of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
Because numerous companies have so far reacted with attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, health care and old-age care".
Due to the seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industries have been running again since September.
In mid-December the winter season begins there.

Losses in profits at Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after it came under pressure from declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the rail sector.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use under the ambitious schedule next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results were behind the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector perform” in view of the stock’s limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Weaker deliveries for aircraft were largely expected, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program progresses for the aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
“The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been set up during the aircraft’s service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the rest shortly after, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer can start a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share the year before.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Turnover declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30 and remained unchanged as of December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, Bombardier's stock dropped 8.5 percent to $4.83 after it was also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would move to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
United States: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is being kept informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said to have seen a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as reported by several media outlets.
One traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried and children would have cried.
Panic broke out among the waiters, many hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
He was taken to a security area, the man said.
The shots were reported to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
evacuating airport buildings
Television footage showed numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought out of the building to safety.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operations command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 am (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, led to a long delay.
Except for landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several pilots were also seen on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss about police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information on Underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison.
A well-known criminal defense attorney who warned a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his activities in the drug trade after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The “first-class” lawyer, nicknamed “Bash,” was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner in the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a large investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 worth of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out during their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house, where he placed the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s garbage can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but declined to take cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed their discussion was subject to “lawyer secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office under his private address as well as in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal issues.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney General Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has gotten too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer supplying his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between attorney and client.
He countered the police investigations as much as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus forfeited his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
“If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta made the step from a criminal defense attorney to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underscoring our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Songwriters’ Guild of Dunningen will frame two services with the “German Mass” by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 am at the church service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The exhibition is presented as part of the worship services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism weakens growing confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, in the pastoral care unit Haslach (SE) basic things will change.
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, M<0xC3><0xBC>hlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Nothing can be changed in the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is for the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became especially clear: the skepticism towards the new is fading, but increasingly a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral care team were enough.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly defined guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg by means of a presentation.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual churches.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council, in which the pastor Kraft Amtes is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in which six parishes are formed local so-called community teams.
Your task in the future will be to promote the ecclesial life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that the accumulated funds in the parishes remain purposefully preserved.
On the other hand, the liabilities are passed on to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment will then hit all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested," said Bruno Prinzbach, relative chairman of Haslach's parish council.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbara Ritter, the chairman of the body in the pastoral care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had set themselves the task of "one will, five stay" and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The committees of the Haslacher pastoral care unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be concreted in further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As J<0xC3><0xB6>rg-Arne Bias, managing director of the Stadtwerke, confirmed to S<0xC3><0x9C>DKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorf family costs 70 to 90 euros more per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This envelope is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes.
These figure the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can charge by means of a surcharge on the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher turnover, as J<0xC3><0xB6>rg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We're assuming a 1 cent plus x increase," said Bias, with the number likely to be close to 2 cents.
Beam on permanent red: Pay attention to the waiting time
Sometimes a light bulb just won’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do when you drive in red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the light bulb.
However, those who continue the journey despite the red light must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns, referring to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver had ignored the traffic light and had to take responsibility for a negligent red light violation.
The light bulb was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but not the fine.
The City Council is pleased with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nach is well filled and the administration no longer knows debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success.
This became clear at the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with about 7.6 million euros exceeded one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about 1.8 million euros, about one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The asset budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the supply of reserves was also higher.
In total, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to now a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a piece of work out of your sleeve," Gerster said, looking at the annual report.
He and the local councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that could soon cost the citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, in the past the municipality was able to dispense with high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country had already been cut several times.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensation poles.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must present certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of raising rates, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster said.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was solemnly honoured.
As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the now probably more than well won choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and association: J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Kohr, a pastoral speaker on behalf of the C<0xC3><0xA4>cilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard F<0xC3><0xBC>rst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual courses: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Br<0xC3><0xBC>der".
They prepared a small st<0xC3><0xA4>ndchen for their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "J<0xC3><0xA4>gerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folk-style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, kidnapped foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers' department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "Was ist der Schwob?" by Hans S<0xC3><0xBC>ssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" again in home fields, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children occupied the lunch well.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Bote would like to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and children's cribs from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with it to the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many hard-working builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers themselves?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the savings bank Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law effectively takes the media into a deadlock, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconian".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media have drawn the wrath of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing the units sent to the crime scene allegedly looting the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to be interrogated, even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s “living blogosphere” according to its description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunter-gatherers,” he said.
Kenyan legislators have already drawn on public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their generous salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-free – among the highest in the world.
Bad-D<0xC3><0xBC>rrheim: A dream come true for FC
The importance for the city and the football club was not affected by the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field, despite the cold weather and rain.
A more pleasant hour of celebration had probably been wished for by everyone last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So had all those who came without umbrella or could not hold such one for any reason.
This went for the musicians who framed the festival, as well as for so many speakers.
Nass also became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were primarily due to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who joined in.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The wealthy pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new roads.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also appreciated by the MP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Indian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was thought.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of 104,000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356,000 euros at the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf took place on 4 June.
During the construction phase that lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal affairs and justice.
In addition, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, parliamentary protection and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be one in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD endorsed its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flat rate for long-distance and thus ecologically counterproductive”, declared the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of evasive traffic on country roads, which are already the main focus of accidents.
In Pronold’s view, the introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step.
"There is a risk that at a later date the compensation for Germans will be deleted," he said.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Muesch was on the road towards Grefrath with her car on the Kempener Au<0xC3><0x9F>enring at around 21.15.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. T<0xC3><0xB6>niser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, she overlooked the 37-year-old’s car.
The vehicle collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blockage after accident at Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m. on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Shortly before the roundabout at Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzle, he noticed that he was on the left turn-off track in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and switched to the right lane.
There was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constantizer.
A 19-year-old man driving behind the BMW VW Passat was also damaged.
A total of about 15,000 property damage was caused, the police said.
The roadway had to be closed during the accident, it said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be such announcements at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speaker diameters are thus eliminated - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cancellation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already do not have the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls from the speakers are heard in one day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual persuasions were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight paths or departure times here are a bit lost," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling the brake car with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are hung on the Kaltenhof in Swabian.
Teams and individual fighters measure each other in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horse iron throwing and water eider wear.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It's not about the distance," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, should once fold over and then just lie down.
This is evaluated with the most points.
When casting horseshoes, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
Eight meters away is thrown on a pflock.
Dexterity and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10 a.m.
Suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scots coat.
Swabian dress is also allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury will award a few more bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour early, a lot of action is already on the pitch on Saturday.
In the evening, the blues music lovers come at their own expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birab<0xC3><0xB6>hmische Blasmusik from Sch<0xC3><0xB6>mberg organizes the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and Schwarzwurstbaron, will be among the guests.
In Dornhan, he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool's house.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early kicks, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle B<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party end.
The stop-picker party with DJ Ralf kicks off already on Friday.
Other program points on Saturday and Sunday include the vintage car and tractor meeting, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn maze, the artisan market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, a straw hut, tractor riding (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the multi-purpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Z<0xC3><0xBC>ndk<0xC3><0xA4>psele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quark substitute.
The World Vegetarian Day is celebrated on November 1st.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt can be replaced with soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Foldable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mousse or one tablespoon of ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Instead of eggs, dough becomes loose, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Black Forest High School got to know the American metropolis of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, it immediately went to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here you can enjoy a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time delay, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep", the day was decided on in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the Empire State Building’s 373-metre-high viewing platform while enjoying the view.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the fall sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school life at Weymouth High School.
Once again this year, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the H<0xC3><0xBC>lsbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge.
The Jagdhornbl<0xC3><0xA4>sergruppe of Jagddreiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on Parforcehorns (natural horns in the mood It) according to old, originally French melodies.
The winders wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog hounds on tow hunts musically.
The festive fair takes place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storefront shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One who wants to make the name the program.
According to the lexicon, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
If you visit the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, you do not have to stay with the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has just that: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but hand-stitched repeatedly experienceable.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but non-cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as gourmets before the opening of the beautiful café at Opschlag: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the opschlag, the sympathetic café-lovers hope for more audience.
Last but not least, through college.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” emphasizes Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most diverse variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner is more of an expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is a cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better to say one.
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right".
And with an event I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
It should be noted that Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the store in Kleve.
The street that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomic miles and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu.

A day of gratitude at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence in the name of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the appropriate festival to pay tributes.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was given to the writer Rolf Wagener.
"Not only did you write a lot for us, but you also made a lot of rounds for us, for that we thank you very much," said the choir's chairman Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity bouquets went this year to the conductor Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was occupied by scorer Artur Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner.
A special thank you was sent to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a menu of the extraordinary class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. in the club room.
"New singing voices are welcome at any time", says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Goals for Combating Poverty
The United Nations is now starting to develop a set of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests”.
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not shy away from implementing this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even though the Achim/Baden team has been without a win for four days, the handball superligist is still in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what a victory like this tastes like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn down trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance warning.
I trained a lot of players in the A-Jugend.
This is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their former coach.
"In addition, it is necessary to wait for reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Most of all in the cover work and the switchover game, it was a huge hit.
The use of opportunities must also definitely improve.
Therefore, I hope that during the short break my players have finally got their heads free.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to make peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA to the country in the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who “wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo would give up the 1992 peace deal.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, and that is serious,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are putting their heads together,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a offending movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos’ electoral success has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It’s unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has made unsettling attacks on police stations and vehicles on key north-south connections.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port is used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has further increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, sluggish development progress and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said the people simply wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” according to one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were “far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic", children would be "completely turned off", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "underwhelming".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took up his retirement residence in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining stage play.
From the arrival to the awarding of the honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received a lot of praise under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his children’s heaven, in his courtyard.
And then the play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht presented him with the Zweisp<0xC3><0xA4>nner and "Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder F<0xC3><0xBC>chsen" by Erich Becherer from M<0xC3><0xBC>hlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to take on the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimicry and gesture.
Between the individual scenes, the M<0xC3><0xBC>hlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
Haslach’s mayor, Heinz Winkler, then gave himself the honour of being awarded the honorary citizen, who, on behalf of the then official, H<0xC3><0xA4>ttich, together with a part of the city council, made his attendance.
Their attendance then made the three-king singers, who prompted Hansjakob to cry out: "Oh how beautiful, then youth memories of my own three-king period will come alive again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the outgrowths in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever,” he said at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the Bundesliga basketball players from the sporty Ludwigsburg have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible follow-up place.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breath from Ludwigsburg was not to be heard.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, as long as it is not established that D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufsteiger D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitral Tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, the Rhinelanders have been denied the licence twice.
The Arbitral Tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening meal church is in focus
As the city’s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Church of the Evening Meal.
After visiting the nuclear cellar museum, the Haigerlocher is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning conclusion is a visit to the church of the evening meal.
There, the leaders get the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a through and through Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also looks at the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Sch<0xC3><0xBC>z with the support of Walter Kr<0xC3><0xB6>ll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the one and a half hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller-Museum.
Tickets can be found at the ticket office of the Atomic Cell Museum.
For questions and information, please contact the Haigerloch Tourist Office.
Snowden could also speak in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spying case in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, he said.
Long breath is paid for
Six men's teams fought for the title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
The tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, each playing against each.
Played in dual mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were on par with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Second place went to Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asfaltriecher team reached the bronze podium.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful outcome of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children’s and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for every age there is something for everyone.
The children are assisted by local craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also operated.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, the young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as pushcart races or stilt races, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 14 o’clock each.
On a railing run, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are false.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be driving his Schabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
In the meantime, Hermann B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner is welcoming and fairy-tale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o’clock.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is seen as a lovable cause because he set out to race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt is not to be taken away from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he moves to Los Angeles by ship.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles peeps disturb residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue bulkheads and back-loaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the handling devices, a shrill warning sound sounds across the terrain.
“The signals are for safety and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the case of unfavourable winds, unfortunately, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot ahead of him at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep sunbathing tank in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can be completed here as well.
"This year, we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark in the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF Suez power plant goes online, then 5 million tons of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship dumps on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not dampen the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can stop us from believing that we can win even against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
The guests initially managed to turn the piece of art into a guided tour 13 minutes before the end of the game, before Piraeus once again gave the game a turn.
"We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made ludicrous mistakes," said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichers, who had scored clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title-holder Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: just under a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a speaker at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd straight jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has expanded, as it did at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too familiar at some point to perform at a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-swappy fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he would sometimes walk down the street between two buildings and think, “Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.”
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers, Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they strangled the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the boy they had taken with them was supposed to state that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the act before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder mentioned a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a mental institution.
Inmates must go to jail
The Constance Regional Court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-a-half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, bribery, threats, insults and dangerous bodily injury.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
According to this, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had been buying for him for some years.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he prevented women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested major doubts about the mental limitation and thus a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be detected after an initial notification by telephone surveillance measures.
The conversations that were heard were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had discovered blue spots all over her body, had not made a statement to this day.
It is a “completely broken personality” who sees violence and exploitation in this trade as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He got out of these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after his arrest,” he said.
Oil price continues to rise up to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that showed China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in electronic commerce in Europe in the late morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has strained prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after hitting its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocks Decision on NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked a judge’s order calling for changes to the New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk program (“Stop and Search”), and exonerated the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal from the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for arresting and interrogating people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in changing their policy and the corresponding training program.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and oversight, and set up a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing is scheduled to be held after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-risk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been available in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of the unelected Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men belonging to all minorities, which developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as impact the way other police presidencies enforce the rule.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would dampen police morale, but not crime; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure since the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-risk practice that was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only be reached by dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende H<0xC3><0xA4>nde".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the talks, images of the inserts were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to work at the club in an advisory function.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a district of misery on the outskirts of the capital - in a record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you could not make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospital here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a wealth of local colour by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the club, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal reasons, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and tracked them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“In the prosecutor’s view, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people’s homes and hopes to catch them freshly, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW feature editors when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire’s apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective’s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects.”
At the time of the investigation, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I’d like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as those of other important figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett because of an affair with a married woman when he was himself linked to co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without result.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was hard, too.
The strike, which was announced for the end of November, will now also go through, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between November 29 and December 2 are therefore excluded.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to have the planned measures explained, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, had been a devastating event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protection of as many built-up land as possible is the goal," says H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
It is based on the planning of protection against a flood that is expected to occur statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,” says H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality can count on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
H<0xC3><0xA4>ussler pointed out, however, that the funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the community depends on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be carried out.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) foresees local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor K<0xC3><0xBC>hn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald und Corbe from H<0xC3><0xBC>gelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interaction of all the presented measures in order to achieve the desired goal in the aggregate.
In addition, one is expected to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Discourage prevailed among residents of the altort, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and first steps have already been taken.
However, H<0xC3><0xA4>ussler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of regenerative events could be forced.
Enlargement of the sewers would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could not say much about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so heavily clamped that the fire brigade took just under half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both of the victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The line was closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazing the kinship in the outside: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousandths.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is terrifyingly similar to ours, mutants look to the future - and the police attack.
“We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the agency said.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for this we have a penal camp full of pesud offenders."
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick’s narrative works like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA’s wiretapping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of forces, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only does it buy mistakes and victims, but it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Merkel's spying affair in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying case for German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier, Green MP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Fight against Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Security Service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage capabilities to “steal the operational secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower employee, began publishing his full horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director’s word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new high due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was related, possibly for as long as ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate executives are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” explains Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, the documents leaked by Snowden have so far not provided any evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Anything but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spying authorities uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
In the case of cloud computing, a big change is taking place because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to U.S. law and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy managing director, says: “We’re seeing a new question from customers who didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders are of the opinion that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this provides advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick to a trade fair or leaving a laptop in the hotel room unattended is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at car manufacturer Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to collect phones before a board meeting so they can’t be used as a hearing aid.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when going abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China in terms of the countries that used to obtain economic data of the hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make,” said the philosopher S<0xC3><0xB6>ren Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important vendors were represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has taken off again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
On the front, the many-equipped and embroidered dresses are closed, often with a veil, while on the back, they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
However, this is where the spirits separate, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleiderm<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
For men, the suit is dominated by vest and plastron, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of venue is important, it has been explained.
Unfurnished side rooms are not optimal, the atmosphere should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the discount.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But kittens are also popular for bachelorette parties," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" - so shooting series in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the second time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to 12th place with 87 points.
Susi H<0xC3><0xB6>pp and her Woody in class 1 faced the critical views of the judge of performance.
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe he was murdered
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringer mat in his high school gymnasium, are convinced her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigation officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old’s family was in doubt.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson’s lawyer Benjamin Crump told FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff had concluded.
“They believe that it goes beyond any logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a “positional suffocation.”
A second autopsy, however, resulted in a different cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence to support a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would direct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have verified.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to how he died.
CDC Publishes Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies among faculty and staff and how to treat children who are allergic to food.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand auto-injection is most commonly used – in order to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states recently amended the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-unique genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents are no longer required to declare gender for such children, but may state “undetermined” or “undetermined” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain mutilated and scarred by the flicker created by doctors.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children is born each year, neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovules or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise that you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the child’s psychological and physical development before – if at all – deciding on an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can perform a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons because their status is not gender-related, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court granted lifetime retention of an “undetermined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “gender theory” should be removed from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: “If the world is torn into a new state where sex is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born to both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after now it is known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels growing up with the gender assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency,’” Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then it was not the psychiatrist that was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. Johns Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental impacts – such as parenting a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones and shaped whether a person viewed themselves as male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision to completely castrate the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal patch.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign an ‘undetermined’ to the child,” she said.
We fear that this favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to which you should force small children at this time.
When they are adults, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the prescription effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space so they don’t have to make decisions in a rush,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write “male” or “female.”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy parenting happiness.
And you do not have to rush into an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown girl injured by gunshot from car
Unknown persons have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in a car shooting.
The perpetrators allegedly fired an air-pressure weapon at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday night.
This was reported to the police at the castle.
The girl was slightly injured in the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The attackers also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The police are investigating, they said on Friday.
To this day, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the owners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains immediately, no material damage is likely to have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvester bulls were also set on fire in the city area, but no damage to property was caused here as well.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in paper and his radar shutters were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found all his radar shutters in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives beautifully.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
“You’re not afraid of spiders, are you?” asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and I for some time now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-something has had to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, a book has been published by her on the topic of 'Living happily in old age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't go well in old age," she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of 'living in old age' at all.
Most people push it out as long as they can.
Only the others are getting old,” she says with a smile.
Only when the suffering pressure is really great, think about it.
“It may be too late,” said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
“But which form of housing you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for old age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also combine in the Dolce Vita,' says the specialist book author to consider expatriates.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age everyone has such ticks and ticks
"For me such a community would be nothing," she says with a wink of an eye.
Not at all like in a student dormitory with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In old age, you just need your retirement rooms," says Ries.
However, the book’s author does not want to rule out that a senior housing community can still function.
However, this has to be different than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace,’ she believes.
With this opinion, she is not alone, at least in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa R<0xC3><0xBC>tten, the head of the civil service Life at the age of the state capital.
Their office advises people around the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also take into account inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the age-appropriate remodeling of their house or apartment to first thoroughly inform themselves and not to entrust the first-class craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment can not always be remodeled age-appropriate and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud had to make this experience huge.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it greys her more than before the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He has been accused of illegally passing on classified information.
Therefore, he must face criminal proceedings in the United States, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent remarks would not change that.
Earlier, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with further punishment.
Psaki stressed that Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele’s statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Intelligence officer Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
According to a translation distributed by Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, the letter has the following wording:
To those in charge
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed as a contract or direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which compelled me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high-ranking officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations to be a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one but a service to the public.
These spying revelations drew many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken into account have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will adopt this deplorable attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts of the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden attested by Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its most recent meeting in a non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier said.
The budget was set at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay attention to the entertainment of the house, how to heat, to look after the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier said.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the bar at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chair Manuela Honeck explains the musical pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first music shock.
Report: Obama Campaign Considers Replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book in front of it, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether it would look better for Obama’s dwindling hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent for the Times, the book traces in depth the story of the efforts of campaign and White House leaders, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on poll scores of former Secretary of State Clinton’s trade-off with the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew about the planned change.
In “Double Down,” it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their “close, personal relationship” before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible poll scores at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as “supposed care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
“Campaigns don’t spend that much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
It’s unclear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president was “aware” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew anything about the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Possible,” Martin replied.
What happens on the go with my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to the traditional mail?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not pay attention to creating a stable basis for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the two computers connected directly?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are traditional emails being read on their way through the network?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like Gmail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday deals.
Do unknown people read the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence services also have legal options to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from being read?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-readers.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to easily identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes, according to an August 2013 study by Convios Consulting.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had recently fallen, Google’s Gmail was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the forest locked up and pension cashed
When his busy mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay their pensions and maintenance.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest, according to police investigations.
At first, he had covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he had stashed the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: At that time, it occurred that no more medication was needed for the needy mother.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to police, an autopsy did not reveal any evidence of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that glows in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you leak, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats up the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish bulb is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for that.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef, and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light produced by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six days of play.
All in all, it is now time for the team of Ingo Ehlers to enter the Derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins anew for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehlers says optimistically.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is on pace.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase in coverage, which has recently left everything but a sure impression.
Daverden’s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first win against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favourite for a long time, because everything can happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to settle down in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Jugendliche Joost Wind<0xC3><0xBC>ss, who is active with a double playing right at the A-Jugend-Bundesligisten HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I became more of a Halloween muffin.
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I probably will not do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, infuriating inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I don't think there's anything wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not clumsy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and gum berries.
So good news for the 41 million people who move through the neighborhoods with the phrase “sweet or sour.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s face it – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than the houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos of you just peeping in your pants and seeing your friends on Facebook where you can’t get rid of them again, and then leaving a comment on the guy you’re standing on.
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we’ve done since we were kids.
Fortunately, the “baby in pumpkin” trend didn’t start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to trim the pumpkin and not sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin tarts, which are slowly rotting in the front garden, probably originate from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mount charred body
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
Rescuers are holding a charred body from the house.
Rescuers found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
By late Thursday evening, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unclear.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor’s profession.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day schedule yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people for the study of theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien refers this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastoralists.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly, in the free economy, more is paid, but for this, theologians would have a safe employer.
This is what the young people of today are facing, who are not just looking for a career, but for a meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theological study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rigours and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called to rescue a puppy trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock protrusion in a quarry
Cocker spaniel dog Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a quarry in her miserable location.
Firefighters Sailed Off Rock Wall and Rescued Dog From Safe Death
The fire department managed to secure a puppy stuck on a 15 meter high ledge in a rock wall.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run away after a Sunday afternoon traffic accident and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and posted calls for help on social media when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker performing his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported upstairs in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like a stiff-frozen one.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a couple of dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge accident.”
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, but found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to have her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker and that “he drugged me when I was 18.”
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative for Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever attempted to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Perhaps she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Prism“ landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European disengagement gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not, as expected, play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So, not really a story.
And one that has already come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to naught.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to toss the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – which was only founded this year – won nearly five million votes in the September Bundestag election, effectively expelling the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the compulsory jacket, which the respective national economy is forced to stick to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has tied its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians like to do that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage fixings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany at bay and raise Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, with which the battered French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election, bringing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among working-class white Frenchmen?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in this election – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide somewhere.
I suspect that Scotland could do very well in a looser European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition have been responsible for.
It would be ludicrous for Scotland to now opt for independence, only to then be forced into austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter is already growing breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming down parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is coming quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, as well as body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the appearance of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but it is considered “frozen” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings, unlike their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter got her 10 days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys, like girls, enter puberty early.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be affected by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
A dispute has arisen between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always those most sought after by airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims made on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. ore rival Boeing says airlines should decide that.
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engined long-haul aircraft, and are expecting record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
How the rear of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “Mini-Jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” seats 406 people in the tourist class, which is over 17 inches wide and thus allows ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute hype about technical details by advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, with the headline: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
In the face of changing eating habits, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the freshly christened “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat sizes and says it is not in the manufacturers’ discretion to decide how airlines balance air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to studies, the experience on the plane depends on more than the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they feel they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s cabin expert.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming a topic that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezed more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could come with cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, Airbus’s offering is driven by the threat posed by the 777,” said Mary Kirby, cabin interior expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape measure to measure the facility in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compact design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the importance of more cabin adaptability and offered wide seats at the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably fade, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Make Smoking Enjoyable
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further trials are needed before human testing, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit while trying all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “time out,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he was absolutely sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“You know then: when they start smoking again, they don’t feel any pleasure anymore because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to stop the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
A probe into former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being launched by the state's corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies changing the maritime lease regulations at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden stakes in three plots of land on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiration in August 2005.
It is now being investigated for the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid’s covert interest in the property after Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, made a corresponding statement on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought in the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tenders.
But he denies making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshuffle of the government’s lease arrangements.
A phone record provided by the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied Tripodi.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used on a criterion that would prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be perceived as an insult by Australia’s neighbors.
“Voiceful statements like ‘foreigners should get behind’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka for human trafficking talks yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the “authenticity criterion” is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if “the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company or is personally related.”
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after companies that initially only wanted to support a small number of workers have hired hundreds in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island by a refugee boat this week.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been looked after by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father’s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the British government on the plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to make an “unquestionable” commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said, “The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK.”
That is why we are delighted to be working as a partner of the UK Government and exploring options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode.”
Passengers are already allowed to do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take off and land.
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement which U.S. airlines have to do a lot of work, but do not follow up on immediate plans to change their regulations.
The aviation safety authority CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
“CASA does not currently have specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
The subject is subject to regulations according to which airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has said it is open to changes, but these would have to be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices because we are confident that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will stay with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices are not allowed to be used at launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and will certainly take a closer look at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different for U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier devices safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB supporters with light missiles had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic, which was offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
The south grandstand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: No singing, no battle calls.
The podium of Capo, who otherwise coordinated the joint lighting, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, there was a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadionbanbot".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the pitch as always as the first BVB player, short-term cheers burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves – but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand nothing stirred up.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again enumerated the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp - did not provide a celebratory mood.
Just five minutes before the whistle, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which had until then been palpable with his hands, escaped in a loud scream, as Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last but not least, as always, it was the southern grandstand - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came with a whistle from the South grandstand, everything was back as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the fellow BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectators' ranks and onto the pitch - and at the same time almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreographing the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I have forbidden it,” he said.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"It's going to be tough," Watzke said.
One may be curious as to how the reactions on the South Stand will turn out.
Pfandh<0xC3><0xA4>user booms in Singapore as crisis arrives in the middle class
In a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping centre, Janani Amirthalinga trades in a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so there’s all my money in it,” Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative assistant and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is so high that ValueMax, where it traded, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent demanded by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no credit check or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families feel the pressure of rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for pawnshops to make up for the difference in a stifling economy.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor’s rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency, have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“Ultimately, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” said Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have further strengthened the trend to pledge personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customer base in recent months in its stores.
The growth in the pawn shop is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders were caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offered lower interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise debt.
“Customers lend items they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase the budget cover,” she explains.
The pawnshop business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Wealthy people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden has a vested interest in helping Germany solve the ever-increasing NSA spying scandal.
According to Green MP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, during his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which the ex-secret service employees would testify at a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare worth over 325 million Australian dollars
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $325 million bailout for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “immediate measures” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election services.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are designed to remove debris.
In addition, there is money for day care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care for inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinicians have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability duty of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election benefits will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s federal health policy spokesman, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today’s announcement is just a “plaster solution.”
“We are in the current situation because the Labor government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million in the Commonwealth and then pretend that’s the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, the film tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic boss and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides into lust or sensationalism – and that’s where his problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penance shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as heavy clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
On November 1, the Hague-based organization set up Damascus to destroy or make “inoperable” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the town of Safira on Thursday, when experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as storage sites, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government’s side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad’s army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide details.
The fighting underscores the danger the chemical weapons inspectors face as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “suspended ... and the chemical weapons program facilities there have been moved to other named facilities that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month.
“I take pride in the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the watchdog organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against the Assad government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a split of Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded in anger to the verdict for the last of the instigators to be put on trial, as Umar Patek, in her opinion, was to be fatally shot.
Patek, who has been on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
If convicted, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many more.
A charge was also brought in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, is also referred to as a "Demolition Man".
The decision has sparked painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won’t have any more grandchildren and I’ll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was likened to the ground when a huge bomb exploded shortly after 11 p.m. in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped almost a decade of detention, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had hinted that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand up," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused other people.
The verdict came ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his ruling.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but not make phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the rules for stowing equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to restart until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing, passengers must turn them off again and must not restart before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft refitted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Attendant Professional Association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like a warden on this subject.
Nevertheless, internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there’s still no “Words With Friends,” the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he publicly had to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was parked at the airport.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA, has the power to regulate telephone calls.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert, told CBS News that mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with air masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to investigate the issue, recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, this is the case, which up to a third of passengers forget or ignore to turn off the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communication devices by VHF radios carried by passengers became known, which at the time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they don’t mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years now when the flight altitude has been reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when flipping.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the proponents of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but none could detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the disruption by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only occasional reports of pilots talking about a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passengers to switch off the equipment when landing instruments under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable fit for travelers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA is recognizing that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into the wild.
The water slide was flown to Aberdeen last month by a helicopter, where it was docked by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water slide was probably a wintery migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the borehole.
He added: "He was unable to continue flying, so we were contacted with a request for help."
When she was released, the water slide was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK who care about prosperity and jobs want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing roughly the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favoured by the government, rather than stopping with the long and grueling process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be regained in Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and probably most of all, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which can be found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring the lever of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas pipeline
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Management said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: Construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, in which the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides for an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" turned off.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work is to begin in other subordinate countries on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past Germany’s real estate location.
The economic framework data are correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in the European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
How sought-after German commercial properties are, shows the view of the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year’s segment.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
“Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft – even if cell phone telephony remains prohibited.
Combat aircraft attack a depot of Russian missiles in the port city of Latakia, as officially announced.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual misconduct charges against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with child-related sexual offences before charges were brought in 2011 against Caringbah’s child-care provider Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had “never dealt with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organisation”.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there were external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as a front-runner in child safety”.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) quality audit in August of the year.
Hare, who started at 21 at the YMCA, admitted that management had “failed to downgrade” Lord’s hiring and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexual misconduct on twelve boys during his two-year tenure for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denies that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the employee from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately looked after her as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose boss was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lords boss at YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable.”
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, rather their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, so they would not have reported him.
Hare said he had told the YMCA NSW board of directors his view that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan-Lord incident” was “not reporting” by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality commitments shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA’s Children’s Services CEO, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been “over-the-top” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, to the Commission.
He explained that there had been “serious problems” in hiring, reviewing, training, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but concedes that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and has mostly confined his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister’s office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts found themselves in droves in Cardiff to pick the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who are not even in kindergarten and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee kicked loose through the three rounds and picked up the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had his cap set at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in handling the pony, which are well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practising with the Shetland Pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire participant field and have left the pitch with a gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Total strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showcasing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was electrified and everyone was cheering and clapping.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
The way he’s started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges rated Fenton and Toffee based on how well they had beaten themselves and presented in the show ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes contributed their part to making it really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be ‘reformed’ after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now, the New Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the publicly listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it had been decided to “administratively punish Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of his reporter license.”
In addition, “Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and to immediately review the leadership team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain the trust of the public,” he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I was acting wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to properly review the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a law change earlier in the year in which authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric train operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in zigzag over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be undetected in it, authorities said.
At the time of the discovery of the tunnel, eighteen and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the court records.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to the authorities, were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, they face prison sentences of between 10 years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, posing the drug cartel the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passageway with rails running from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has announced his separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric to be aired on Friday, Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly the way we plan or hope it.”
Kerr and himself were still in love, the 36-year-old said.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to the lexicon, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs from it in a very significant way.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream pies, ice cream or a strong edamer, these junkies are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to giving up meat and fish, the vegan abandons all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but with a closer look, the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, veganism is an ethic.
“I don’t want animals to have to die for me,” Proctor says of the vegan maxim, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of distrusting burgers, scrambled eggs, or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, and enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan doesn't amount to giving up, it's not asceticism, it's an enrichment." The assumption that diet change reduces the choice of food options leads Proctor rather back to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that led to the failure of some well-intentioned attempts.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that causes many to give up quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor says.
He said, “There is no such thing as an animal that cannot be tamed.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue party.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly taste good even once.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste good, but that’s not just reducing it to animal food,” Proctor said.
He did not suffer from health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I do not take in any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who exclusively eat vegan.
“My blood levels are excellent, I get checked often,” Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
“Since animals are fed feed instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the cooler,” says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 levels are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on site.
Every now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but that's the way it is with "ordinary" finished products, as we know."
However, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly believed.
“There’s a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tweaks you can get good, if not partially better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes Proctor could also amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new flavor.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, this has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also sceptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, one must act as a vegan with a sense of touch.
“I don’t reject people, I am part of this society,” Proctor said.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Apples are everywhere!
“Many doner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he deviates from pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly moving towards it.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,” says the New Zealander, “you have to talk to people, make them aware of it.”
“If enough demand comes in, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Komb<0xC3><0xBC>se in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on their menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of it impossible from the start,” says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
In particular, when one learns to understand that even in peanuts animal additives as colorants can contain its, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and falls.
Not only that, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
“You gradually develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos to pay attention to,” Proctor says, “It’s sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stumble.”
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointer that strikes the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn’t quite manage to put his habits aside, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was halted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures at the stock exchange operator.
It was not until Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
At first, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
It took the stock exchange operators almost an entire day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading fell for several hours due to a computer glitch on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook’s stock market was also on the rise.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of buying and selling orders, later found the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and fined the company a record $10 million.
Constance: cyclist kills 63-year-old man
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on his way to the market place on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a women’s bicycle on the left footpath from the station.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist was no longer able to brake in time, police said.
On the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and drew a space wound about 15 centimeters long at the head.
A ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police issue extradition order against Assange
British police today handed over a extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had given the 40-year-old Australian a “challenge to stand up” that asked him to appear in a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would face arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on charges of a sex crime after his options were exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard has issued a request to a 40-year-old man to stand with a police guard at a time chosen by us," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after he published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the revelation website WikiLeaks.
Driver hit between legs with 210 km/h and hot drink gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and having a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 costs as well as a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
Tax for Foreign Property Owners Against London’s Speculation Bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes in the 2012 budget, which cost over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who keep homes as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the income from the stamp duty on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced apartments and the introduction of related anti-circumvention legislation, it is hard to claim that high-quality properties are too low-taxed, despite the effects of the outdated community tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London, or deter owners from selling it,” he added.
Top-notch real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s prosperous southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a Savills study.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog’s tail wagging is related to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail walked more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right halves of the brain respond differently to stimuli that elicit positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tailings of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock once moves in one direction, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (from the walking dog’s perspective), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the dog’s perspective, which sways), then their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagging of the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their pet’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog if its ‘tail’ sways to the left rather than to the right rather than to become restless – the exact opposite than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won’t be long before we understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer became ill with throat inflammation.
The Sheffield-based band was scheduled to play in Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with throat inflammation, which is why he can't appear."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this belongs to a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, is held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be scheduled,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He declared that it was “well possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called cardinals from large places, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat back
General Motors recalled nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority said on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
“If the vehicle is driven up from the rear, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” read the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch by the leading U.S. automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama Voter's Cry of Despair
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts Barack Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take my breath away.
The election became a landslide victory and newscasters stopped to face the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you are being ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has accomplished, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced confiscation of homosexuality in the military, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the party’s political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to be interrogated or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can’t explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are being punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election.
It doesn’t justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by the age of 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the office of MP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unexplored alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard about for so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings dropping to less than 45% this week, the book’s return to 2008 has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have been dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to make a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania by-elections.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to get back on track and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.

Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The Bergbaumagnat, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to abolish or reduce CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with a 53-vote lead after the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the vote-counting process so that it could proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, select it immediately and then have the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
To be able to match pencils these days is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about service to the public.
“We are not seeking any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency division, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is exchanged daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the ongoing investigation into the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been fired from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed to transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, officials familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
News of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks lead to the fact that “you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had this week terminated a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle base
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the building fence on the Bechtle-Grundst<0xC3><0xBC>ck on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleared and widened the footpath, a press release said.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the plot had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the site is in danger of slipping off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative much in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that with the realization of the project of the city many will do better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, the BI says.
As you can hear, the mayor’s public statements also have an impact.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he fears the out for the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens' decision.
Some appear to be almost scared, others see them as a "plump of blackmail" on the population, the press release of the BI continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Shield for Schiris: Mane no Schwalbenk<0xC3><0xB6>nig
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg is, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenk<0xC3><0xB6>nige category," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig last Sunday, when the Senegalese became a supposed actress to the fate - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"It's a very bad decision," said Rangnick, who called Harkam a "completely overblown".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig coach Adi H<0xC3><0xBC>tter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with H<0xC3><0xBC>tter.
I don't know why.
“Because I’m the one who was offended,” the 46-year-old said.
In the face of the success, however, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he said.
There is not much to expose.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep it that way.
There will be hardly any changes in the framework during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except a player comes forward with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Law
It’s a big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and also argued that the Health Act’s stipulation that states must either extend access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place turns to light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters in height, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the valley residents moved up sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (around 615,000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian alpine resort of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post barely learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for Sunday's emptying are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the emptying on Sundays and holidays does not take place anymore," says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, emptying takes place only in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 36 and Jakob-M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1 in H<0xC3><0xBC>ttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten even Sunday will be empty, will not be answered in the response to the request of the FDP.
The FDP’s social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz R<0xC3><0xB6>hrenbeck, wants to do something about it.
The Sunday training is an important postal service at Terminpost.
"This thins this undertaking out radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals' faction and city association, supports his colleagues in the group: "What annoys me is the fact that here, in secret, the hours of study are changed or even deleted".
The post office is miles away from citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschlo<0xC3><0x9F> and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and R<0xC3><0xB6>hrenbeck unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also on foot.
R<0xC3><0xB6>hrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, there is also a Sunday school in Hofheim.
His party has called for privatization.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city’s magistrate is advising this morning on a proposal by traffic policeman Stefan Majer (Greens).
According to this, the parking fees will be increased by 50 percent.
For this, however, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "by far appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also become more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG G<0xC3><0xB6>nningen from the Swabian Alb.
The <0xC3><0x84>lblers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
However, it soon became apparent that, also due to their age, they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the joy-cities.
With the hard and placed covers, the G<0xC3><0xB6>nninger became extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the middle of the net and were not present in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all matters.
In the face of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third set was then won somewhat loosely and lustlessly to the 3-0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly assert itself in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik B<0xC3><0xA4>uerle, Yannik B<0xC3><0xBC>chle, Sebastian D<0xC3><0xB6>lker, Felix P<0xC3><0xA4>lchen, Stefan R<0xC3><0xA4>ller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially when taking the ball; even on the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical game scenes, the overeager prevented the gaze for possible point gains.
In this very balanced performance meeting, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small Engl<0xC3><0xA4>nderh<0xC3><0xBC>tte
On the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engl<0xC3><0xA4>nderh<0xC3><0xBC>tte in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut should be cut free on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the canyon, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Day of Care is a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Government Presidency of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sightedness covers itself with the aim of preserving the now highly overgrown old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved for the future with the Life project and the previous care days.
After these various versions, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, and the forest tractor could be called up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the clearance of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the viewpoint.
L<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen: K<0xC3><0xB6>pfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarst<0xC3><0xA4>dtchen L<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior policy, as well as its own municipal works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet registered.
The only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running due to his age, is the 46-year-old banker and business owner Dieter K<0xC3><0xB6>pfler from L<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen.
The application deadline is Monday, November 11, at 6 pm.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday tightened an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was bribed by him at Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that aligns internet search terms with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google placed an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was passed on to Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, the accusation said.
Egypt Pledges First Freely Elected President
Mohammed Morsi is resigning from office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which has its seat on the Nile and is emulated by an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been heavily targeted by the government since it was founded 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy shortly after eleven o’clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential splendour of the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly halted so that the convoy could cross the usually busy street that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As the Brotherhood’s uncharismatic “replacement wheel” mocked, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising’s efforts against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told judges in the wooden paneled chamber where he took office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his commencement speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band that played the national anthem, which he listened to in a position of dominance.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university’s largest auditorium with choruses of “The Army and the People Are One Hand.”
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers taken over by the military council from the head of state who had been ousted from office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech at Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday evening it continues with an <0xC3><0x9C> 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers fell from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a faulty heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guest house.
As he climbed on the ladder leaning against the roof drain, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the state hospital in Salzburg.
Rape in South Africa: Two-time prison sentence
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the channel SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The incident had sparked nationwide outrage.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booysen during the night.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient.
Prosecutors also stressed during the trial that they were convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa: there are about 64,000 reports of sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the number of dark figures for sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right from the start: the most important thing for the ham is the pork bones, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in any supermarket, so be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Uli explains Jumbo’s working methods for the company “Adler” in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and a tickle does he get inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can use the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at fast food in Waldshut
"I'm getting a lot of work done here," the TV makers, Black Forest hams as a mass product, marvel.
16,000 Colognes a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
Television with level?
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco," Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is still worth it.
The spectator sees that the splitting of the coulombs continues to be manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoker fire visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Tannenzweige here in the smoke provide the special taste of black forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," the TV star concluded.
This will allow everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has raised its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes of between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million in its earlier forecast.
If the current targets are met, then that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made an 8% profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private businesses.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on their way to record-breaking annual income before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings drivers.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which equates to a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK performed well, while business customers spent less here as well.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third year in a row for the full year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unprecedented texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Examinations, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our review system to restore public trust,” stressing that the GCSEs would “become more challenging, ambitious and rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to hire more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from real life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors will be presented this weekend in the town hall.
Reviews have already been made on Thursday
Once again, the Ortsverein W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 a.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a stately raffle and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Constituent Assembly.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If in past centuries people had known too much about it, and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which to this day shape our conceptions," the contemporary prophetic teaching stands out from the hopes of perfection rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope has been duly driven out by religious criticism among Christians,” she said.
She “provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have dropped off.”
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
This is connected with the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything will be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert Ludwigs-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 from Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia Wilhelms-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair of systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their faith at the signing ceremony
In two religious services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
The worship service was accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Sacrament of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the firmlings had prepared for the great feast day.
In different projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race delights participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, there were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Championships.
Both of them were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the finish line and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again placed in second place.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team Nightmare, who managed to reach the top of the podium.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
Also, the age structure ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year even more absolute top athletes were at the start.
Four drivers were able to detach themselves from the regional top drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, has already been the world champion in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German championship titles in Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a wink final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just a second behind, the routine player Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Wave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for every 5,000 people.
Tune in here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is 413 for a doctor.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer left in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and ride on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help with the laced medical equipment.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and the wave – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – is happy to be part of the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins investigating hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and this on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s an exhausting thought, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a broken bar that he had received now allows him to work again.
“That changes the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for her second year and is a volunteer with Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Wave, this is a chance to gain practical experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery, where we can help bleed or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” explains O’Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
Once in Yaoundé, however, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For the wave, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father, brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea, is cut on Horst Janson's body.
Janson is himself an old rabbit in his craft, the acting.
The old man Santiago can't be fooled when it comes to fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
It is almost believed to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, that’s real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman through and through a character role that Janson mastered excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately, through his knowledge and also his willpower, wins the fight against the fish.
Janson is on stage as a solo performer for a long time.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the Cuban way of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play the Cuban rhythm and are guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 metres, a Roman-era sewer is preserved below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne does not pass by the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who admire the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne’s underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too big remained of the remnants of the old city wall.
Therefore, most users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and leave only their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal lattice bars in the Parkdeck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of hand-plate-sized stones.
"These are the remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is also hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend into the depths again.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition hall, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 meters.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze said.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the ground water, which was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by varying levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is expected to begin soon.
However, a few more years will pass until completion.
Leg almost chopped off: reissue of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker community is rolled back after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in the Frankfurt (Oder) district court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor's office accuses them of having stabbed and beaten three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the rival group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about district fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the judgment after revision of the public prosecutor’s office and referred it back to the district court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
In the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was invited.
In the center were cell phones of the accused and other persons who had been interrogated by the police.
It’s hard for Rocker to almost always stick to a law that’s more for them — and not make a statement — in court.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims was unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office (Oder) said on request that new traces had appeared since the last procedure.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
The throwaway company doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: in the bellies of the people on the passenger and rear seats, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than chilled driving to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I’ll admit, I’m happy to be with you if it’s late at night or early in the morning at the fast food holen.
A couple of apples, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become noticeable.
Because what does one have to miss, that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street edges and on parking lots.
“Why?”, I ask myself.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next bin?
It’s not just that paper waste spoils the landscape.
Bags have also already covered up transport facilities such as guide boards and thus triggered accidents.
But she doesn’t think about what this “throwaway society” is thinking, she probably doesn’t even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evenings, just with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after nights spent: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower there.
There a few bags would be more or less nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the remains of other people's food.
I can already see the day coming when cities and communities will be too stupid to evacuate – and the fast food chains will have to demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health care
President Obama made a retraction yesterday with his often repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a resignation letter, the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama made his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to numerous media reports of the resignations, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“You get a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look around for a different tariff because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said during a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to win back your trust.
This statement by an upset Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long repeatedly urged Sebelius with the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-sponsored insurance policy to himself conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, the report said.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted a similarly anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed Israel had carried out the attack but was not sure.
A spokesman for Israel’s Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, in part successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry in an unprecedented admission that U.S. spying has “inappropriately gone too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the U.S.’s distasteful stance on its surveillance programs, saying the spying had in some cases “inappropriately gone too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has been plunged into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so existed, which goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September 11.”
He later acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and had saved many lives through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is bent on killing people, blowing people up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop that before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged U.S. spying and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. on anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who is a first-time Democrat in the Senate and chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance about the NSA programs.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week declared the reports to be inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his office is preparing for the congressional trip to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to come to terms with the fact that we’re not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the grumbling about US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the spring joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai M<0xC3><0xBC>ller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz insists on the use of Nicolai M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on its use in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goaltender with six hits.
After all, the Mainz have already had to do without the injured players Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Prison Sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the ruling and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
“We are of course very worried, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the ruling and is against a bail of 50,000 baht on free rein.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she is vacationing in the resort resort of Krabi in Southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its battered tourist image, and so it comes to an acquittal.
