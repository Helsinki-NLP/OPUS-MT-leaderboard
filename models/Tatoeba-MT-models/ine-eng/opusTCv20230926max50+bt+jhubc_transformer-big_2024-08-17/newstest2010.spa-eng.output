Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet with the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, though the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he did not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate them to charity, but it has not yet decided to which organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will attend a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defendant of the nature accused of blackmail
The police in Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice accused the president of the civic association Society of Nature Defenders of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Sociedad de defensores de la nature Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, Litomerice police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Society is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently under arrest and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno there is no separation of rubbish at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only by the fact that we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, tossing a PET bottle in the center of the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the Moravské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> square, opposite the Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Huse.
Don’t be angry with me Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That’s why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By vagrancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn’t see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which shames us all over the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other subjects so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with the official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is truly the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
Paroubek's Budget Removed Money from Income and Disease Subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, disease subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rents or disease subsidies. "That only means postponing problems for the future, it's laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when borrowed money is taken, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce social subsidies or operating expenses of the state, you have to increase taxes.
To all those he added to the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about income or disease subsidies, they'll get it, 1.8 billion of these accounts went missing.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be missing in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be missing five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is to keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in jeopardy, warns Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Every year the dividends are paid off ecologically, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly $3 billion was raised from the budget to provide various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, take over the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are already missing for the project Statn<0xC3><0xAD> pokladna (State Treasury), whose price is two billion and which has already been initiated. It must allow online monitoring of what the different authorities are spending.
The first phase begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just a press of a key, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile, you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
The company VMware cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during the year 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only ski lifts in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e worry about snowless slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at deals, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said Spindl.Info portal maintainer Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n according to their expectations, should not hesitate any longer to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
<0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n hoteliers mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That’s why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is impaired by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be exhausted as well," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as it snows, the interest in staying in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will spend the snow yearning waiting.
On Thursday temperatures should drop and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové, of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for fool.
When it finally revealed its eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text repeatedly use the phrase “as in Iraq,” but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for his own statement: “A New Way Forward.”
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today nothing is talked about Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however, he objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but it didn’t come to him any better, so he at least fooled the general about 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted on at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s whole strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing bosses every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin; after him will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy collides with his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans have less and less willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election and therefore there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will not receive cash bonuses again
Top executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, 20 billion dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a fifty percent tax, bonuses for banks exceeding 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and in literature from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, among the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
In case there are several prizes in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most awaited Nobel Prize, the Peace Prize, was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country involved in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was reported by the spokesman of President Radim Ochvat.
On her tenure in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved the left’s proposals for remittances on Wednesday and increased money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDGs, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, effectively liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed in the fall by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, according to the president.
SDG leader Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek saying that the budget deficit is terrible, prepared for this year by the former government of Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
On Wednesday, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood’s new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictitious U.S. president, and even of God in Evan Almighty, still as important as ever.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help bring the country together. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years for Mandela’s story to reach the cinemas.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that when I squeezed his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and he had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it, and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, "I look a lot taller in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: “It was a very good story, a very well made movie.”
In the movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had conducted tests on an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The Bulava missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again on the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians alike from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by asserting that one cannot simply speak of failure.
The first two stages of the missile held up and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches were completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defence, only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulava" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will once again perform at the age of 51 at a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manages to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to the AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary frontman Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all supplementary work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, i.e. it will be worked in two shifts, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend Christmas holidays in one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they committed to meeting the requirements and the document was signed, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplementary jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement of the emergency by strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production began last November.
As of last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in the ‘Qualified’ HIV Viruses
Czech and German scientists test new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients’ lives can be significantly extended thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs will no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the albumin of the virus.
Metallocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarbons are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology in the Institute of Organic and Cyclic Chemistry.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget approved for next year is "horrific" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to support the minority, which tries to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDGs before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government’s desire, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disillusionment and sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, that he is thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the nominees by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also clearly state whether he will resign if the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness grants, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the SDGs are not to blame
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which relies on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about it, when the time is right, I will take care of it,” Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies, who was appointed to the government by members of the SDGs.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
The SDGs are at the Prime Minister’s request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that the SDGs in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday would probably vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask the SDG deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question, whether the SDGs do not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
Upon resigning from the mandate he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of trains of <0xC4><0x8C>D will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some fast and local trains less used and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule goes into effect.
Most rates, including basic and customer rates, will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy for this line will add a pendulous road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route fewer fast trains will run, direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction of planned transport by dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy is in the region of Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run every two hours.
From December 13th, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year’s regional rail bill: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy are happy with the system, and perhaps that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will only take place on one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 kroner for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children were released
Armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the southern province of Agusan.
They say about 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield on the run from police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously chased the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA’s story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), will be released in American cinemas, capturing part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago for the starring role by Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There is great hope, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa culminate. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the starring roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA then won the World Cup.
Entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people come together and form a nation, rugby player Chester Williams said, the only “black” on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled his country to Britain, said in a recent interview for LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
A <0xC4><0x8C>eps company transformer was caught by the fire in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is put out.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesperson for <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for the northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire at the power substation did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps worked in the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which bring the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distribution system, in addition to maintaining the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a defamation complaint against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hetmans
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a defamation complaint against three social democratic hetmans.
It is about Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the region of South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> Region and the hetman from Olomouc Region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the cake raisins", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence from all regions. According to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose that it will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, which would aim to warn of these measures from the regions.
Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l told him, that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
The campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy to maintain regional railway links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a member of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don't leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
Pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum vaccine prices, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear on the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January, children born on August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between the third and fifth months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily let their children be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1,600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450,000 crowns annually.
No clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all of the children’s vaccinations.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country every year die according to research in hospitals 28 children no older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcal disease.
At the moment we do not think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
The voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks, say doctors
The presidenta de la sociedade de pediatras The professional society of practical pediatricians Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, then save on treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “get the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta's father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
An unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means necessary to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Father Frazetta denied having granted such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report against criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling “wasted” an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax deductions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 involved “difficult decisions,” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers, it will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% drop forecast in April, while borrowing would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"A wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan request projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” dodging difficult options until after the June 2010 elections.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're going to do," said Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond in the shadow of the Treasury Department. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek greater deficit reduction in the short term.
But liberal Democrats said the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandcastles.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said the timing for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvering, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that adjusting public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the Finance Minister’s figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All the important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins wins,” said Roger Bootle, an economic consultant for Deloitte’s accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI Investigates 'American Detentions in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information on the men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported; but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime’s “models of abuse” before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man cited in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s election sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election result.
“They often hit me in the face,” she said.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the agency’s mandate and powers were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a racetrack.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was quite frightening.
It is seen under a beautiful view of the city lights titling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent.”
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Saudi-associated purist Sunni Islam, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “a value adjustment.”
After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate landscape in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In On Thin Ice, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their worth in the face of the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a valiant 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult’s range. The climate is almost never suitable: a Singapore resident polar bear turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the swirling ice floes circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite surveys and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of salt water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being boarded, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans’ graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in Arlington Cemetery tombs, Pentagon areas, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the cemetery’s vast meadows and hills.
The volunteers went to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t receive as many visits as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couples took each other by the hand, as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose gravestones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Sgto Marine gunner David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban Officials Arrested by U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has applied on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but has been denied permission.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are in jail for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a tough report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba", a reference to Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro's position as the country's leader, to replace his brother.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed in one day.
He stated that any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani Officials Unveil Plot to Send Men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Accordingly, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not immutable and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the recruiters’ critical role in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determining who they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is paying special attention to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, because of their potential to have access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years regarding who they admit to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center take bolder climate action.
Protesters said 100,000 people attended the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding signs in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “The Earth says “enough is enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change already happening.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but you have to do it, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mostly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing black sports masks and attire placed several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I wasn't really aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it was up to the perspective of each to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal gradebook on performance in mathematics was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best performing systems, the scorecard showed that fourth and eighth graders gave up at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth graders in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially steady, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points out of the scale (262 to 202).
Although scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week as advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit advocacy for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what’s worrying is that we’re not devoting either the time or the energy needed for our high schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school and middle school students who did not master the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a math curriculum from kindergarten through sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of glaring dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its administrative resources and reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to ending the performance gap is to extend the traditional 180-day year of public school in the District to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who struck a deal with her teachers’ union last year in a 185-day year, which she considers an “indicator” to look for a bigger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resounding.
Graciela Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 12, went down and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less of an impressed guest than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
That's where I'll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously,” he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you’re going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who have access to the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest performing say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University Tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate from high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Oil Ministry Reaches Agreements With 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away by having bid on only two of the 10 sites auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for sites auctioned in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in opening up Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by mass coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest oil reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two major sites.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda’s top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in northern Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the CIA-operated type inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official from Pakistan’s civil intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalis were among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner for al-Qaeda, which directed the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
It was dedicated to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this likely included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalis had risen quickly in the ranks of al Qaeda and were well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a well-known name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al-Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking operatives.
The pace of CIA-led drone attacks has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally from The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
The top UN envoy in Kabul is about to resign
The top U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was undermined by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timeline for the 18-month military withdrawal will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the Afghan security forces’ preparedness and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials collaborating with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peace missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said Galbraith’s accusations, who was fired, “certainly hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference” in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate U.S.-led assistance efforts in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the U.S. and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would boost their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined his ability to attract talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He said a "package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer enormously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s tightening up with the international community over some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven’t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of Dec. 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, including continuing what Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously stunted, single-child malnourished, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
The UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Population Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Demographic Research, said central government officials have been debating even more radical changes recently, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality’s family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want more children.
They want to give their best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally eligible to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was too: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, the owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategic “they have to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate chief Yvo de Boer described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the conversations last week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser to Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the talks will at most produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government come to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed to the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center, the activists playing the guitar present night shows mocking the countries they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of by email), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, vice president for global international conservation policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first 225km-h train redefines Monday’s feeling
At 5.13am on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 kmh, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected outlying areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and changing planes and cars to railways would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears over environmental damage, can still brake Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will hand over its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn up within a 25-meter radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Western Midlands.
The line would split into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It seems this will be the most beneficial option,” said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 kmh, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains 400 mt long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a Conservative’s <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his electoral district home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "rationally", increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the applications "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges inquiry into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage on his London property to the home of his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, up until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
BRE’s standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, the rate it is now at.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as Speaker of the House opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive “rational” after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live off rations and be treated like shit."
He said: “I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in the shape of the pound sterling symbol as a protest, after it was revealed that he had asked for 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the payroll office and later by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about evading and delinquent or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the Advent calendar of Brighton beach palapa
The palapas of Brighton have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled cakes and ponche served for free.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the advent calendar of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to test and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in a call for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would come into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing worldwide climate mobilization represented by these demonstrations contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with sledges and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the “Black Bloc”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set to welcome the guest speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelit vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial showers responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue seas” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there is time, said the Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-off to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the “350” network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 over control of South Ossetia, another Russian-recognized Georgian separatist region.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Election Commission of Abkhazia, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergue<0xC3><0xAF> Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the voter turnout.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation,” his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the election table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central issue of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful for the support of Moscow, and very particularly for the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped at about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set to welcome the guest speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelit vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the “Black Bloc”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a handkerchief, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial showers responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue seas” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to “unify climate justice and social justice”: “Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world.”
The Oxfam organization, together with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-off to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters demanding action against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the “350” network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography comes out reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be broadcast in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first baccalaureate will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
According to the Minister, "Hypocrisy is enough" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be subrams of the C, he continues, even underlining: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography as a second baccalaureate in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory second-degree history-geography education. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the C-baccalaureate second program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will be aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test about their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in internships.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal High School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the “Ernest” conference round, a conference consisting of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey the desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of charts in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier."
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgust among prison guards, planned to take action
The prison guards unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them in order to denounce the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", because it would be "shameful and unacceptable" to default in December on the payment of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), "convokes general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not reoccur in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budget demands," Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseille said indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott to new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the moment when our tasks and missions increase without taking more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the prison CGT of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not what was expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes “Better Gifts” Than Those He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will be celebrating his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to famed television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: “I make better gifts than I receive.”
During a special interview that ABC will air Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the New Year’s Eve celebrations at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be out of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to program excerpts broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts,” she said, teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before he responded with humor by pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, yet I adored that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims to be in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked for "herniated disc surgery injuries" in Paris on Nov. 26, his press service in the same city said, noting that such injuries "need a repair operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pains and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, interviewed by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park international clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday admitted Monday to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he went to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to get twelve hours of flight time after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed he had been operated on from a “column cancer” after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been over-reported, with fans and journalists noticing the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favourite distance
French triple medallist Frédérick Bousquet won an international title at a distance of 50 m free during Euro 2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were surpassed when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a brand he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two distances queens of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman imposed himself with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia’s Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to bring down the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1.
These swimmers, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same event.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to drop his mark in 400 m (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up on this race.
I knew that this time I would not be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunk women, is an uncommon piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this batch has been the highest bidder, no doubt, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborts Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said conditions were not in place to move the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied bailout.
At the moment, after an evening telephone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to fly to Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migrations.
In order to grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "give up" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to step down ... they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has usually made statements since the beginning of the five-month-old political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around Brazil’s embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, was overthrown on June 28, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the court for the crime of “high treason,” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress overwhelmingly voted against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big novelty is the growth in trade volumes, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the course of the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose to 3.482 percent from 3.42 percent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield rose to 4.492 percent from 4.408 percent on Tuesday night.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies of White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 “Ladies de Blanco”, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of the government of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees are dying!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raul!”, the militants of power held dissidents with their fists high.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration was held against the “Ladies of White” in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by police officers dressed as civilians, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forcibly boarded the vehicles to the dissidents who were booed by supporters of the government, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities assign opponents of “mercenaries” or “agents” to the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Senese Highlands) on Thursday at the time of highest turnout in the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant would have hit an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to an Alliance police union official.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man severely.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher’s knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained at the scene an official of the Alliance union in the Hautes-Alpes, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were stabbed, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. Putting him in a safe position, I perceived a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "any such disorder whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks to dismiss the case
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski claimed again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), to dismiss the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of The Pianist, reported to three California Second District Court of Appeals judges serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel said: "I'm calling for the charges to be dropped right now, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before giving his sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells stated at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “has to be here to appear at the hearing.”
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of escape?
For her, the filmmaker "calls for a favor from the court, although she despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer tolerates being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street Loses Course and Slows Down by Dollar Rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed aimlessly on Friday, in a market that is debated between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped improve the market’s view of the robustness of the economic revival,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3 percent in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were held back by a further rise in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which “leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are on the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sportista or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!, said surprised Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 a.m. GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World contestants focus on the contest.
India’s Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Just like last year, the candidates took a safari, visited the famous Soweto township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dealt with people I never thought I'd meet.
She’s probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time.
The singer's estranged son said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday due to an infection resulting from herniated disc surgery on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The musician is “in induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday due to an infection, following a disc herniation operation on November 26 last in Paris.
The singer was operated on again Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school act, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Private Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated on twice from herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently "went without cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Order's Council, and is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause hemorrhaging and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems to me very risky, Camus stated.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardista party, urging him to be supported, all the way from being arrested.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the UDF title, as he felt that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after reaching out to him on the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, it was assisted by the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and to transfer the rights of ownership of the brand to them, under penalty of judicial action.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they said the UDF "has been a true political movement since 1978" and recalled that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center does not, according to them, have any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It exploits in a scandalous and fraudulent way the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to carry it out on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the Octogenarian’s state of weakness to rob her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But the No. 15 Correctional Court also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010 in which they must state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll accept.
"I'm going to talk to her," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’s lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
“The investigation will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect,” he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal lawsuits against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a multi-faceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the provenance of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ claims turned out, on some occasions, to be a great family confession.
Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer thus took into account three letters her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office considered, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardian judge refused, in recent days, to make way for her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said Public Prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be given once the trial was carried out.
Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as previously it was about imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market-conquering strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of R&D and, even more so, of business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) “requires that all parties involved ... have proactive behavior and a forward-looking vision”; it needs from employees a commitment that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory that the American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent research of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanistic management position, unsuited to the world today.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilization Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into all business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make it part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business executives can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “in place.”
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of “just war” against America’s enemies, hailed Obama’s speech on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican Party to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated Thursday in Oslo to justify resorting to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear “a left-wing president” when he reminded Nobel Committee members “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the resort to force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “spoke like a U.S. president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few right-wingers not very convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monotonous, pretentious and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times estimated, judging it “both gloomy and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee the Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached on Friday afternoon an agreement that ends the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau “rejoiced” over the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text according to late morning.
Even though three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a nod.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.72 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some rebel dissent, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects wage earners, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as “a historic agreement.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of road transport general meetings in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million drop in employer burdens” was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “on the same terms.”
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a “na<0xC3><0xAF>ve business”, as the 100 million euros “had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but in order not to contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk “the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months”.
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, trade unions not in line with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturdays and Sundays, trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train for every two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train for every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers each day, were delighted that “RATP is striving to serve the big stores.”
The RER A crosses from West to East the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran at rush hour, and almost no train at valley hours, as had been predicted.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the sidewalks thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had woken up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF coming from Cergy-Le-Haut or bound for it were arriving or departing from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, and the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the leadership on Friday afternoon, will be analyzed.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers who claim a premium are owed, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even brackets its premium proposals, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to conduct "a more extensive analysis of the exercise conditions of the profession," the RATP said.
This also led unions to say that the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, who until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents submitted a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey’s Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the country’s southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the “focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The 11 judges’ decision was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kilic said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are barred from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 benches in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned ahead of the verdict that MPs would leave parliament before being MPs without a partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic ties” to the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes at a time when the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a resolution could lead to renewed tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan’s conditions of detention have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large Kurdish-populated southeast city.
The Order’s forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or slingstones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, T<0xC3><0xBC>rk said the court’s decision would “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
Nothing is resolved in this way, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snow can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
At all it is something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the whole of vehicular technology.
Maybe on the weekend meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections come out with large salt vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also the accesses for the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
FES service starts around 3 a.m.
They should cover approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with it the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins".
The hardest part is when it starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
“Then we have a problem,” says the winter road maintenance director, “because then no one is ready to clear space to vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble comes in, he knows Brauburger well.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
In general, the FES could not take over the entire bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salted vehicle starts running as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-high animal that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A discovery confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the Orn aviv<0xC3><0xAD>s.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae researchers found indications of air sacs, such as those also possessed by descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related lineage of the later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Accordingly, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a unique land mass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found, along with Tawa, the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct on the border of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
The success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
It may have been a massive extinction event that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halted the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Involved are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Involved are teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction from the occupied casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt has had an impact all over the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centers throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students protesting on the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English, they “reject” the police eviction promoted by the board.
Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler, president of the university, last week evicted the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike, because the walls and artworks were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize the protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hesse, however, defended the actions of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an Aktuelle Hourde broadcast on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a delegate from the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying the students’ arguments and demands in depth, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow’s ten districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have been in contact with the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of close collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt, the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010 FIZ representatives and directors of small and medium-sized companies from the natural science research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, on which research facilities were settled.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and flatly about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg region into a decade of chaos from irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at that time engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of a modern railway traffic, since in the past it took a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives from back to front.
Rotate, dry stop continue the journey; but this is how it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is approximately halfway between the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course also have no more input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE built section towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, provided with many green areas, probably computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for transporting people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than trucking on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the slow-moving route has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the verdict on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, whether to file an appeal before the ruling on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to regulate again the prohibition of night flights.
Admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided by the federal government, would not be compatible with mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file the appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticised this delay and pressured government representatives to drop the appeal before the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's slogan "We fulfill our word."
Minister Posch rejected Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel’s recrimination, which the federal government would be trying by law misrepresentations and tricks to still get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a while.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally unassailable decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group’s claims about the overnight air traffic ban.
U.S. banks are repaying the aid.
The big U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are getting rid of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned all the aid it had been granted by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion euros (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the CNBC of the United States.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised approximately $19 billion in cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of items.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported from sources familiar with the matter, that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Choice
In the end, everything was faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German TV channel) pressed the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night, the union wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced the failure to further harm ZDF director Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative council.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter failed on the board with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, they were not going to support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender’s direction the ZDF’s briefings would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law had even intervened in the debate, who called Koch’s proceeding unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked for the station "S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional lawsuit after the dismissal of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year by the media magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch’s opponent on the board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of political supporters from the ZDF’s control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the union for the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, both Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a staunch supporter.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is assigned anyway to the liberals of the left.
College Careers are Cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university principals, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the undergraduate and master cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the race should end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers more flexible.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the principals of the universities have been continuously talking about the improvement of being able to successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, we are talking about specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studiability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in choosing a course.
the courses.
Students would have “the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These should be "re-credited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federated states.
Education and culture ministers urged federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far, only Rhineland-Palatinate has provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single examination should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studiability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
At the federal level board of Juso university groups (young socialists) it was required that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university principals.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as the main involved should be able to comment as well.
The president of the Board of University Rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor’s degree to access a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient places of study for the Master with the best possible study conditions.
The federated states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about increased access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
“Going in and out of Germany is made virtually uncontrollable,” says the front line of a poem by lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded several literature prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lessons or talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he talked a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner read a statement in which he admitted involvement as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate against fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner had received the German Language Prize.
Attempts at recruitment had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“So I’m someone who didn’t defend himself enough against attempts to provoke fear from the Security,” S<0xC3><0xB6>llner said.
The lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that highlights the abysses and wickedness of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
Walter had played a role in his Securitate IM file, literary scientist Michael Markel said after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession, and stressed Walter’s positive influence for him.
He had excused or defended him on all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this claim,” he said.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for Securitate-Spitzel gewesen spies, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote in the weekly Zeit in July, after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved must have speculated and in some cases known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of the files of the control by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of the Records of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the handing over of the records since then is rather traceable.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview with Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, after the Nobel Prize for Literature, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke contemptuously of the awardee.
“She has psychosis,” she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case, like so many times when there are silent guilts.
The calm reaction of the listeners to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession makes one expect that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the longings for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the VfB football team from Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed exterior service was coming out of a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the manufacturer of item Hubiertos.
The bald man had hired a chauffeur, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old man drunk with joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the final eight", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we can not let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" was waiting for them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draws
The Champions League final octaves (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of Babbel’s successor’s fulminant entry was limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, which had soon inspired the bewildered professionals of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more pitched, Soul Repairer Gross explained his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, “when in football a new impulse arises, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury soon advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was missing, of course, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all else.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the victory against a weakened defense due to lack of relays and totally exceeded the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
The fact that Heldt did not want to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, took on Heldt’s harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change coach due to pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also called his day off after the games as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, and announced consequences for the latter.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the replaced coach’s team, it would not have been possible to have a show of great play and battle force.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important part in the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship (World Heavyweight Championship)
Burning duel in Bern: Time and again the challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version beat U.S. Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Friday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be carried out.
Klitschko extended his balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was dodging the world champion’s blows again and again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "cannot do anything".
As he weighed in, the champion let himself be teased Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he beat then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
Later that year he won the title to Juan Carlos G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, from the United States.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal attack: Greens group leader J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin called Defence Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly misleading.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast by ARD television, the head of the Greens group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellor’s office, the army and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, demanded J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and his fellow greensman Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Foreign Ministry had no influence over the German army’s specific actions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry’s presentation on the grounds for firing Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed delicate details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two senior officials it transcended that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert had asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, no response has been received, he said.
The ministry did not comment on Saturday on the accusations made against it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's inquiry commission, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
In the waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during wakefulness, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are most often regarded in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
The fault lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality.
Dream-modified alert states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain — especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine — has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the misplaced, squalid forms".
It’s the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red noses like blood, deformed, grinding teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Shouting and malignant voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and secures them to a hook on the ceiling.
It rises in a horn and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson for you!, shout the voices in a chorus that breaks the eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause of this was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, in addition he is manic-depressive, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and they fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes convertibles.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to temporarily lose touch with reality.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes, there are other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten, of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in nous Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and craniofacial trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
According to Kasten, hallucinations are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly cohibted; when our brain gets hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of loves or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She is awake and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting in the next bench.
You can even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he’s in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is introducing a new partner, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations visibly and audibly.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know how to distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the lashes or the girl with bloody cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told her anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed last year on selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since she got in touch over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Insanity is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think that the brain is unoccupied and it is in charge of seeking entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he has been calling dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Boundary situation between sleep and hallucination
in this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person experiencing them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
The dream-conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or a disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische L<0xC3><0xA4>hmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an insurmountable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of soul-saving.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after heart valve surgery with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he was lying in bed, an elderly man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek man on a motorcycle hijacked him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the snow-covered Alps and found himself with a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiricism, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27.
The new publisher Kallen has arrived at a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become 27-year-old heirs and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
One cannot put their children before 7,500 workers if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end up with the kids and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
In the beginning, he was responsible for technology.
After the departure of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer, he also took over direct marketing, foreign trade, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the editorial board.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to, “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decadence: "This has always affected families who get infected by the urge to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “great delusions,” says Burda.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play Time in the world league either; those deals have become too big.
Integral Beauty
All that you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -who is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spagi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spagi<0xC3><0xB3>n.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and newest facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premise of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'Live Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Live Office' (Logistics for the Deployment of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote the activities of Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European standardization groups and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a scenario of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants,” he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IAP), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place during the 5th to 7th of February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motor that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Car Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of skill on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not opposed to respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the stop and start system of the engine -named i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good rating achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the termination of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument panel and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk and with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It excels for its fineness, for its low noise, for its performance and for achieving contained consumptions.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, and for its consumption content.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the blind angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and aletooth and audio l.
In addition, even if its equipment was little, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Concluding
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
'Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re' of luxury
L.A. covers the red sensuality carpet by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped up in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, with no possibility of even seeing a certain type of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has pulled out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and has long been that it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated ear-shots for affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is a fear of using the data, and rightly so.
For a device like FonPeek (it is still curious that it bears the name of Fon when it does not have Wifi) to get this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no wallets.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime-access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite tone of the American first lady.
If you have already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany you in, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greenish yellow with bright reflections-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession of it was a thick lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with a print.
The complements have also varied: green half-heel shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up this time, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start living together as a couple, advance first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have less offspring.
“Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of mating," explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the older the age at which they marry and the age at which they have their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those with elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"Another division among women is also established based on their level of studies.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, middle- or upper-level ones reverse this sequence and prioritize getting a stable job as a pre-marital condition and the arrival of a child,” Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
The British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – gathered at the annual award ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing on the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicente presents in 'Poquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creative character.
The trip has its thrills and Vincent saves no scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here are a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same one that I felt unnamed: pleasure against fate, guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers emerge again and again."
William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that character from Munich to bring his echo to the end of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after the tired life gladdens death.'
About Virginia Wolf: “In the luggage I also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has there been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja for Faulkner's guns?
What did Cela do but to abduct that man's fame so that he could serve as his own pedestal?"
The Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilograms of weight and, without a word, they tipped him two kicks that left bad.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free aggression to a small and defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energy man who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five in the afternoon of any Tuesday by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it will serve for much and not to generate susceptibility, only to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to mistreat for free a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together by the use of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day” and said it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Increase the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of Anfac manufacturers and Gnavam sellers.
The good data, not osbtentatious, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the increase of the last month, the matriculations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and trucks / light chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions posed by the closed tap of bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has hardly served.
They can be accommodated, in addition to the individuals, the self-employed and the SMEs who will acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need for special attention from the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecasts a similar 2010 to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency brake assistance is now mandatory.
As with ABS anti-lock braking and will happen with ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, this is already the case in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of shortage is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, because of its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the piston that gives the driver.
But it doesn’t always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car in stopping.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan have been previously agreed upon by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on Saab’s sale should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the choice of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, takes hold.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision remains to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their last, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by a canvas with manual operation, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, the other 5 kilos were gained by mounting 12 kilos more;
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door handles for a cloth one, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK shift, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with really curved tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as unspeakable.
The weight reduction does not imply that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the contrary: we had not been testing a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much safety in the cornering step, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and re-squeeze his engine...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is highly achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's roar, already previously released in the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, and well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
The "Bag Girl"
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the maison parades, the singer prodigies her purse face with as much numbness as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she's a 'Bag Girl'.
The Baskonia is given a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral scored a brilliant 82-91 victory on their visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous losses that Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and thus placed itself in the leadership of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored his best.
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end to make the victory.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match began face-to-face for the Blues, who put themselves ahead from the start on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already hinted that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was met with pitiful and applause on the return to what was their home, to further extend their lead to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less than six' rating of Splitter already hinted that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court not everyone wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the 'yellows' turning the bright (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The Ivanovic team, injured but not so much dead, needed to spin a couple of plays successfully to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), who got the fourth-place finish.
The alabasters came out to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had a hold and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost badly in Greece to the Olympiacos and conceded the leadership of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the cashiers, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion and also by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him the turn to score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, fight coin, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing their superiority within both zones, where the injury drop of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jimenez, were crushing the cashiers.
Between indoor players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with his triples, increased the lead 44-32, 19th minute.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, 27 minute, which made the leadership of the group tremble.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last down of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja by the direction and triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when tightening and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja was shut down, handing the leadership to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140.000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement Trovit product manager Albert Ribera.
According to the data that Trovit has of its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 a year and a French one <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000 a Spanish one receives.
Similarly, a driver charges <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 net annually in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by that of a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, the part-time jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has postponed Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when he would officially conclude his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said via telephone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said she would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately thwarted by Zelaya's rejection of the political asylum status that the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by directly purchasing assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bars to near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are virtually over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its year-to-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such unorthodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded again, although they remain far away from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the haven chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go awry to silence moral risk advocates who were trying to re-create a charge of conscience over those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and Greece has seen it before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials extend like European corporate bonds we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor’s is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, that return to the charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augurs much life expectancy.
Again, it has all the paint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is discussed these days.
Following his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press a brushstroke of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other "supporting energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to incentivize the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should be started as they take time to mature and a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Innovation Center of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The Frenchwoman Bouygues and her sister Hochtief are her rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to advance the project, in a business plan sponsored by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to get the work done and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia with a notable presence of European builders compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in league, and their partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British Laing O’Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the capital is shared by the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but it carries a clear entry difficulty if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The subterranean toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane’s Infrastructure Office and referred to as the Northern Link, is called upon to link the western Toowong Highway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce traffic congestion.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to pay considerable dividends to Hochtief, which announced yesterday that it had secured a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS subsidiary will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give the German woman a job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer long tunnel for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million Slovenian motorway.
The firm gets this contract days after the works for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that entered the competition convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Telecom fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company amassed more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore reoccurring.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have made $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth clubs to win the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well out of this game.
The white club has been the third in the continent to pocket the most money for participating, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to receive 1.090 million euros for the Champions League.
From this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for the fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (among them Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they compete.
There are also bonuses to win (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and tie (400,000 for each team). The eighth-finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish language is one of the main ones, and it has four allocated places.
The previous year’s champion is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday declassified the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) for the entirety of the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest for this postponement of 1% annually.
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If carried out, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to stay out of potential bids and the judicial swings of its former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a new position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday at the National Audience, former councilors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) stated that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the exclusion of Paternina that presented Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the opt-out filed by Inversora Mer about Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms comply with the current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on December 2nd.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which can not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which he has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools for Expertising Cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No loss is the same, and the calculation of part costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The providers of services and solutions for accident assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by the manufacturers, to then elaborate it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation and reporting tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data supplied by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce their price.
In addition, each model is made a "smart" graphic image where you can "pin" different parts of tourism.
If it is a mass selling model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for scraper parts management or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of the used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does offer it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company, which carries out thousands of inspections, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass is focused on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid for vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car
The Gt Assessment Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has grown at a rate of 20% annually over the last three years, and in 2008 they invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth 1 billion dollars on the Stock Exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auction of crash cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrapers and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been given off cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be taken off even if they have been taken off after a long process.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears, and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
