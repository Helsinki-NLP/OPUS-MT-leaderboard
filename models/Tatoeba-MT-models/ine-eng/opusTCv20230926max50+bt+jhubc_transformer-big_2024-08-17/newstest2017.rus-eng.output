28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine someone wanting to hurt him, noting, “He’s finally got things in order.”
"The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia," the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Medicine said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death has been classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's KGO TV in San Francisco that Frank, a past delivery line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and crushed" by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be greatly missed,” the representative said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in hostels, but lately "he's finally got things in order."
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good heart.
His way of connecting with the family has always been to prepare some dish for us, to prepare dinner for us,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was a brother who was swimming in the stream.
“Despite all the bad things that happen to this world, it was that pristine diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
All those who have the information are asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye crystals of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, the length of which exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, which leads to slow development.
The females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by 150 years.
Previously, it was believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals lives "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenlandic whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired from work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary for us not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under the conditions of a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get recommendations from a doctor, how to live him, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it should not be shunned.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of visitors experience stress.
And it is most affected by people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and allow yourself to rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to take a vacation with the kids, you won’t have to part with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are wellness programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, analyzes, and medical.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic physical training.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account individual indications and features of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend games, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for the infants and provide services of an experienced nanny.
Soft winter, long summer, abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium-resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region, of course, medicinal mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
Water varies in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has anti-inflammatory, bile and diuretic effect.
The same effects have the water "Slavyanovskaya".
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because the salts hold on to the fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in sanatoriums are available and various cosmetological procedures for the face and body.
What types of recovery, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, ivy mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, saturating, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks along individually designed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take baths wine, pearl, iodorom, selenium, sage-lacquer, depending on what the doctor will appoint you.
Prolonged fruiting.
What to do to keep the harvest until the end of the season?
Yulia Belopukhova, an agronomist and nanny, tells the story.
It is time for high-growing tomatoes to arrange a haircut: to remove new seedlings, cut off poppies, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small tangles - do not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants are fed with ash-superphosphate extract, if processed with biopreparations (Addictor - to accelerate the infusion and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamayr, Bactophyte - from diseases, Immu
From chemicals at the end of the summer should be used only copper cuporose, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We make the last watering of plants.
Long-stained cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pour warm water and a solution of zircon, sprinkle the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
To prolong the fruiting of the zucchini is also not difficult: cut off the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night frosts, install over the bed an arc with a covering material.
During the day, keep the plants open, and after sunset, close them.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts polled by the Bloomberg agency, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows positive dynamics - in the second quarter of GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently declared stabilization of the situation.
In front is a slow rise.
According to experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession has been left behind, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead,” the Bank of Russia said in the bulletin “What the trends are talking about.”
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline of the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15", - quoted the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that “the bottom has passed.”
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, the revival of business.
If you make an amendment to the fact that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics in the plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a reduction in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index stood at 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the exchange rate of the ruble, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August since the beginning of the year has strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in Russia since April.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics are also demonstrated by the situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate has decreased to 5.4%.
It was down only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labor market, the question of real disposable incomes of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor can slow down the recovery of the economy, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as a risk factor for economic growth can also be called a tough policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the insufficiently high level of investment, which inhibits the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst of Forex Club Group Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Olympic Games in Sochi, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-foreigners speak, then in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a large enough number of Russians are acting under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of citizenship change is different.
Someone's parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone believed that the best conditions for development in sports will be created abroad.
“AiF.ru” has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of a 27-year-old girl it is written that her name is Lisa Red.
She was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to "lift from the throne" Elena Isinbaeva.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only one of our countrymen, albeit a former one, in the jumping sector with a sixth.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Much because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to struggle in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where in the US Combat Training Center continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
Then there was the bronze of 2013 and the silver of 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her classes.
Soon she was already a member of the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level Russian synchronists can not compete, but for America its indicators - the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training a girl in artistic gymnastics overseas.
Until this moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - she brought out a star-studded team at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" - Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who is in favour of the German national team.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, insufficient to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - junior.
Another gymnast, only this time sporty - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Iran is still training in Russia - specifically comes to the homeland in order not to lose skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in a personal fight.
There is very little information about the floating Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4<0xC3><0x97>100 complex relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to raise about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasaviurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European championships, champion of Russia, master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped coming into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports bridges.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known at home than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
It was there that Michael began to practice sports gymnastics.
It has not achieved much at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualification on parallel brussels.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her classes in synchronous swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took the 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter is in favor of the Israeli national team.
When the boy was just 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyter also won gold at the Singapore Youth Olympic Games.
In addition to jumps in height, Dmitry is engaged in jumps in length and triple jump.
Albert, 31, is another native of Hasaviurt, who after long speeches for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he competed for the School of Higher Sportsmanship of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to pursue a career in Italy.
The family remained there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze medalist of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and got together with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but this northern country failed to get there - had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to study free struggle.
He soon won the World Junior Championships, and later qualified for the Olympic Games as well.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free struggle, and again a former Russian.
This time it will be about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Freeva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently in favour of the national team of this country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He became a bronze medalist at the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The statute of non-qualification in the national team, Taimuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala, - Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to the governor V. Kondratiev, "the Kazakhs need to be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But for now, I think this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positives that were accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everyone is excited and does not know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
GCC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an attacker of funds allocated to the needs of the communal sphere from the budgets of different levels.

According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually carried out, but paid.
Businessmen simply gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent them on his needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov’s machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Central Committee, who appropriated the money of citizens, swept through the country.

However, to the energyists A. Kohan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, beloved.
It is quite difficult to judge in the field of LCD.
Things don't get excited, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of the National Audit Office "ZhKH Kontrol".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
There are also few experts, including judges, on the issues of LCDs.
The lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
Refusals in the initiation of criminal cases, about the hair in the course of investigations are also talked about in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes in the process in 2015, less than half are sent to court.
According to the rest of the investigation, the investigation took a protracted nature, and one in five was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the investigating authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the five months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the meeting of residents?
This means: changing the management of the house, financial and other issues go against the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that the market of housing and communal services can not break normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population.
It turns out, residents in the minus, small and medium business too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the state, - says Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property.
And now this work is being actively carried out.
It’s not just one-off actions – it’s a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital does not smell scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the sphere of housing, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed iron will and brought order, - said Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, and the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
Management companies have been placed under close supervision, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and residents’ appeals, and response measures are placed on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is contained.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource-providing and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs on housing and communal services - because a large part of budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
All of this, I think, explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Does it all depend on the will of the local authorities?
Perhaps it is involuntary to change the place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has put forward an ultimatum to the US, offering to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d’état.
He said this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up support for the “terrorist organization of the Fethullahists.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US is calling for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey’s relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FET (the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either organizing the coups of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
It must make that choice,” Erdogan’s appeal, which was made in Ankara on Wednesday evening, quoted the Anatolian Agency as saying.
Turkey’s president has once again, but has already urged the U.S. to comply with his demand, which he voiced for the first time immediately after suppressing the insurgency.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an made an appeal to the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans may be involved in the coup d’état.
The U.S. denied all claims against him, refusing to extradite G<0xC3><0xBC>len and advising him to change his tone.
The latest statement by representatives of the State Department on this matter came at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the president of Turkey - he insists on his own and also makes demands on other Western partners.
"Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not specify the date of lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkish EU Affairs Minister Omer <0xC3><0x87>elik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, will endanger Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop the EU blackmail by promising to open borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement by Cavusoglu was made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry has not ruled out that the country will consider leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere – they are importing missiles,” Cavusoglu told Anadolu in an interview.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its own technologies, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we began to look for others," he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks to Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Evgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now leading his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West both in terms of business and military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post," the expert told AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of EU compensations, about the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) he will be pressured.
“Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both the United States and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for political information Alexei Mukhin admits that the president of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance against Russia and sought favors in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an entered the period of Chelnot diplomacy.
Being between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," - said Mukhin.
According to him, the main task for the president of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States will stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which with its help control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert said.
Another point of view is held by the head of the Center of Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazov.
Now relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally conducts.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to restart the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, say that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel are settled, there is active political interaction with Iran,” said Ayf.ru Glazova, who admits that the next step in Erdogan’s relationship will be normal.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region, in the position of 'zero problems with its neighbors'.
Very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa have now been made.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s positions both on the regional and international arena,” the expert said.
Glazov believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its former relations with the EU, but now the question is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
The strike of the junior doctors: calls for new collective protests
The representatives of the junior doctors appealed to the trade union with a request to authorize new collective protests in their dispute about a new employment contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Younger doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel a contract of employment deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who took part in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCort said the government had continued to "perseverely remain silent" about issues that she said led to the dismissal of the contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the head of the JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program of expanding collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute has led to the fact that young doctors took part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA’s junior medical leader, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to take during the meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tense, and he hardly radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” to Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the lingering cooling coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter at the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was unyielding.
Mr. Putin burst into anger with a tirade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a stunning, total offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be blamed for everything.
The most serious were allegations from senior management that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had profited from the illegal oil trade from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of some kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring an armistice are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in an attempted coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially a charter flight ban, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They are putting the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her lingering displeasure with the tortuous pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin’s move — which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this glittering palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it’s certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s CEO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has been backing away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer lending brands.
He has been supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller, private banking brands that will gain more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a customer and employee tour of Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and one that our staff will be engaged in because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“It’s a good time for us to move a brand bank, because basically (we were asking ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” the CEO said.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all those brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can return these brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3000 winners with a victory in the Newmarket at the Pristrasti
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Prispassia, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.”
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big world event, it’s not Royal Ascot — it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from business and very unpretentious.
Dettori accepts applause when he leads the mood after victory
Two jockeys achieved such a mark in obstacle-jumping: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 career victories.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he reached this mark that so few reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical swing that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of weekend and big jumps!
Frankie has led the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with the company's fast-paced jump from the horse
From swift finishes to swift jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth jumping for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many big jump winners, including his famous "The Magnificent Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while — Dettori had previously said he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration of Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff, Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as the head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not state the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the administration of the protocol of the president and the government apparatus, reports the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During the appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to step down and recommended Vaino replace him.
Do you convince the smiles?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few people here are convinced – especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement — that the man who was once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with huge skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, you might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister until he returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
The star of the series "Think like a criminal" Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with the producer
Gibson was a part of the sweepstakes on the Los Angeles show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Aaron Hotchner's Special Agent, apologized on Thursday before it was announced that he would be removed.
There were creative differences in the filming and differences in opinions.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be cut from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love 'Think Like a Criminal' and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I hoped to be there until the end, but now it will not be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: the fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandstones left behind by the watermelon.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a shot of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone will be able to shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern flyway and viaduct to Queensferry Crossing – which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four junctions between the "fabric sails", which are now approaching completion near all three piers of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
In it, 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 watt of bridges.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing engineering art of truly epic scale in this project where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the junction between the viaduct and the bridge cloth is a virtual operation using extremely accurate tolerances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is poured into Rosythe today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first shutdown on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this folding represents the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it with the expanding roadway of the North Pole, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north side – or facing the coast – side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and should have been raised at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Exquisite, because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue at Moelfr Bay: Three men ‘lucky to stay alive’
The three men were “lucky to stay alive” after they were ejected from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British Summer Time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried their best to get to a safe place while their ship continued its course.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre rescue boat Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, aged 60, was found disabled and trapped in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow broke away from the man who was driving the boat when it flipped over.
Someone's been guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It’s exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go rips people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited by the TV, then video games and lately smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the total passion that Pokémon Go is, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, all of this lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, being detected, can be 'shot' (through screenshots on your phone) or 'captured'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the full-blown passion, breaking away from the couches to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an "ordinary" person daily.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people it tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to “find 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have not found a response, because most health messages are boring and uttered by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and an even longer list of benefits, too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three fundamentals of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms that are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
After all, despite the fact that apps for smartphones such as Fitbit could have previously tracked our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to exercise, as this game gives.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simona Byles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the slumber.
Simone Bales is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on a support jump.
Unforced on the belly.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62,198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate of the "Final Five" Ali Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bales from the United States performs at a gymnastics event during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth American woman to win the title of absolute champion and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly at any time.
She was distraught when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track and field athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Bales has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals — including 10 golds — with such stunning programs in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One final test was expected in Brazil, the competition not so much between the Bales and the others in this area, as between it and the burden of overexpectations.
Anything less than going back to your family home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted expectation.
Simona Byles from the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Bales earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Carolie.
While Bales insisted that she never looked to the future during her long way to the top, that’s not quite the case.
Part of her free exercise program — the one that includes her signature walkthrough — is set to Latin American music that would fit right in the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, daughter of her grandfather and grandmother, being a child walker and opened by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the gym, where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship competition since the summer of 2013—a streak of luck that should last as long as the Byles want it to.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics and free practice – where Bales defends the title of world champion – lie in ambush.
She again came forward with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riceman gently hugged her as they waited for the final countdown—a pure formality—and tears appeared around the glittering red with white and blue underpants for the eyes of the Byles, when the idea she had once recorded in the album for the cuts came true.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for the four years ago when she shared third place but lost to the bronze Mustafina at the tie-break.
This time the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother", was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed in question.
As for Beales, the viral tweet of the 19-year-old since the beginning of this week now has an entirely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of the serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the deadliest assault on the Phoenix serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter, Malia, were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked in the driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he fled on another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder is unlikely to be the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was available to one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether he was linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over a four-month period.
“It’s happening in the residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, said earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related to each other and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and his daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the shells and extracted the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly — the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which, in fact, is not true – of course you subscribe to it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to put him in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were still doing that,’” Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with extraneous help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund invented for "please sing to me."
“We teach him sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But it’s not just the usual sign language – she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivot remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a lifetime forecast because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding are the cause of rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi.
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatened by widespread flooding after an extreme amount of rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steel, a representative for the Governor’s Office on National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tanjipaho requested tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The flood risk remains in place until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The Met Office said in a statement that an additional 3–5 inches could invade the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect until Friday, as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Dane Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a flood-level record last weekend.
Synopticist Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding going down the stream in the Assensensen parish is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tickfoot River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still hauling people out of the floodwaters in Amyth and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and dog were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another dog, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” said Hansford.
It has reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest inflow she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family have a disability, and he is the only one who knows how to swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is “rapidly spreading” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported rain falling 13.75 inches from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rain from the middle.
Heavy rains and flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from homes in the Tanjipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that Tanjipahoa’s advisor told about 200 flooded houses.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but they are both warming up now.
The president of the parish, Robbie Miller, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were in the high water.
The shelters were opened in the town of Aimit and the town of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the town of Hammond's Tanjipahoa parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available to hand over to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” city manager Lacey Landrum said.
It is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that heavy rain continued to flow along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Aimit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it's still flying to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "fired with bullets", remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police are reporting that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his arm, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot, his little body was fired with bullets,” says his grandmother Delores Melendez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been shot.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a gunfight between several gunmen.
The shells of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different examples of semi-automatic weapons, have frozen the place of action.
It seems that it was definitely a long battle.
There were shells on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made, and police are reported to be looking at surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And the second: three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simona Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Lori” Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, at last, like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simona Byles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez performing unexpected, yet virtuosic gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And a teammate, Eli Riceman, earned the silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look that way in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs, supported with the help of parents, paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, fees for participation in competitions, payment of hotel services (for coaches and their families with gymnasts).
Most of these gyms are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their workouts, and this is an expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simona Byles, and Maggie Hani, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached their athletes from the moment they took up gymnastics.
We need to create a more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mostly blacks and Latinos) and raised national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and it is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of “Women’s Power” in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors have taken on the announcement of further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s offer
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying the NHS was on “no man’s land” and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to work activities at night and weekends to improve service during off-hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA’s Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence on the part of the government.
And that’s despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, to encourage the introduction and to respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocal that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike in late April resulted in the postponement of about 13,000 scheduled surgeries and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were recruited to provide replacements for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "The strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on the teams and services already working at the border, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policy.
The workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics — such as staffing allocation, learning flexibility, supplementary training for those returning after a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differentials in health care — would be recognized.
The drug for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities have recommended giving it to more people and for longer.
The antiverting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service’s NICE Oversight Service has advised giving it to people for four years to continue to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the National Health Service’s NICE Supervision Service has advised giving it to people for four years to continue to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack happens to about 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a thrombus that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move along the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces risk, making thrombi less likely.
The NICE instructional project, published today, recommends giving people 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, with about a quarter of people already having a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke occurs — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective at reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor in advance, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
The culture of PC ownership allows falsification of the vote count in Muslim areas to flourish
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving as a pushback for the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to a blinding of the eyes, which has become a ubiquitous falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to the government’s devastating report released today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has come down with criticism of police, election observers and the city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations because of “excessive sensitivity to race and religion.”
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption tsar, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police needed to be allowed to place borders outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting non-washable inks on people’s fingers when they hand over their ballots, with the aim of excluding anyone from being able to vote twice.
We need to provide better protection to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following a voter scandal at the Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office due to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and forced his critics to remain silent, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes caused doubts or were the result of the persona when a person votes, posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concerns about mail-in vote fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for clearing the voting system, including the requirement to bring your ID to prove who you are.
The report said: “Evidence was provided of the pressure placed on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote at the will of older people, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There have been concerns that ... government agencies have turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ about ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations for cleaning up the system, including removing political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the “voting harvest.”
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter checks on registration to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration fraud and privilege.
Consideration is given to requiring voters to present an identity card prior to the vote.
Use non-washable inks on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people’s nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic postal voting.
Eliminate political campaigners and activists from working with mail-in ballots and envelopes filled with mail-in ballots.
Give the police the authority to establish borders around polling stations.
To amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of people for intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
To require that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the tick” of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about the bicycle analogue of Kate and other doubles of celebrities of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy over French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Pr<0xC3><0xA8>ve, who turned out to be strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete isn’t the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: A member of the men's team of U.S. archers Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the double Kate on the bike path, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. men's archery team, Brady Allison, was the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after images appeared of him looking frighteningly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, the archer found out about the insanity of social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on the face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
“He’s an attractive guy, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Razerford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Ali Mustafin, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of Hora Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the actor "Beginning"
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova can boast not only the same tanned skin and light hair as the actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like a "sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Lewitt".
Rough Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same face and eyes shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Creating a Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize his delight that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynny, as well as the winning gold medal gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to a yucca.
CBC Olympiad commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanghan at the women's freestyle relay 4x200 m upset on Wednesday CBC viewers in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started out like a smell” and “died like a pig” during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle final relay.
It could be heard that McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC team of commentators to “dilute it with color,” said: “This 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby.”
She's too excited, started off like a smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yang, who was 14 years old, sailed through the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly on the web after being shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC announcer just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'???
This idiot didn't realize they were still on air."
About Ai Yanghan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby."
The criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron McDonald, with many calling for his dismissal.
Twitter users did not hesitate when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: “Nothing to myself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald’s comment, saying, “We apologize for the fact that the comment about the swimming performance was aired.”
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The IRS ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The network also hastened to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
“Yesterday evening, we acted expeditiously to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
Let’s be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance, not her personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on the personality.
“I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
“I was talking about the swimmer’s performance, not about her personally.”
"It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
A Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of a store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when some woman went naked to try on panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of the Primark.
Even worse, she tried what she looked like in them, pulled them up and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkston.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkston, where a woman tried on the sweaters before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after fitting her underwear, the mysterious woman again "dressed up and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find somewhere private to do it — she just stood there, shameless.”
“Everyone got tired when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with the other three couples before finally deciding that there was nothing she would like here, dressed up again, and went out.
“It doesn’t look like she cared who was watching her or what she thought of the person who would eventually buy the panties she was trying to get.”
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think someone is going to take home the panties someone else was already wearing and they weren’t washed.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after she left — well, the better.”
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find that another woman was wearing and taking them off, and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkston on Tuesday, August 9.”
All the goods in question were taken out of sale.

Whether they’re right in front of you or behind you, this video will show you how to beat a thief with his own weapon.
If you come in from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn around so that you see the attacker and ‘release the line of fire’.
Then you firmly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder, before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follows the knee in the arm, and as the attacker bends from pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, punch him in the face with a gun and walk back, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, suitable front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and unscrew it so that the villain could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest with your fist, then twist the gun out of its grip, before turning back and aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how this is done.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not a master of the craft — is to give away your cash.
For the guide, the traveler Jan Wright spends his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler has subjected his immune system and vomit reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The 51-year-old Suffolk-based guide and author of travel books, Ian Wright, spoke on the euro banknote, the Circa Piccadilly rails, the toilet button on the train, and the Russian public telephone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is to become a film called “The Guide of the Traveler-Lizuna to the Inner Power,” has yielded some amazing results.
The idea of sliding the wash button on a train that is used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licking brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his gut, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the stations to the flushing of the toilet, this task undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he shot, he said, “Since childhood I’ve been completely carefree about my health and I’ve pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.”
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test smear showed a luminometer value exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison, just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4000 units, while just washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film about a traveler called the “Traveller’s Guide to Lis<0xC3><0xBA>n’s Inner Power,” which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve ever smelled in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The “Traveler-Lisbon Guide to the Inner Power” was filmed together with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company has provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acid-milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Voorenmaa, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let’s say I’d lose respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that’s shown in the film.”
Of course, some things were easier for Yanu to lick, and some were pretty hard.
I’m glad that some of these licks we managed to shoot on film.”
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated acid-milk bacteria exclusively with a good state of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they consumed, at least sometimes, foods containing added acid-milk bacteria.
The family of the hooligans destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, on the eve of the eviction
A family of hooligans left their municipal home with losses of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a condition requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the shelves were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were soiled with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he would be saved.
She said: “It’s been an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don’t think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh because this property will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple has three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the reign of terror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, and drug abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an anti-social behavior order in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be removed, found old garbage
Floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after they were granted an extended 11-week period for voluntary departure.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they've finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the neighbouring Cornwall Housing group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and in addition regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered below on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to take any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrifying for her watching neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 then.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Settlement workers will now have to remove the piles of trash that surround the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as weights, related accessories and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for the tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there are reports that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were soiled with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the accuser’s accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane barely touched the beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to sunbathe were horrified for their lives.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said he was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane spied over an overcrowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance of touch from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft engines, but not being able to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, one of several holidaymakers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: “He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed like he was going to break up.”
Nuno Arrozha added: "I was surfing and I swear, there was such a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were horribly frightened when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was carrying out a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as this was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew a little lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have damaged mainland Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said on Monday that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances such as thick fog and smog from wildfires that worsened visibility.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with detecting fishing boats as part of the task.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for general food for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system – a risk analysis and critical control points – is mandatory for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as food companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Inspections of Rospotrebnadzor’s business for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials only issue fines for individual violations of the regulation (see "List of documents" ...).
Failure to comply with the regulation in general will cost the enterprise 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP as a system that takes into account the risks when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for the astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food businesses not only in the United States, but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on the territory of TC.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the requirement of HASSP appeared in the technical regulations of the TC in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm concerns only food production, and not restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up on what is missing.
The expected period for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey - the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they won’t be in high demand, as their target audience — families with children — is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking for the charters to be approved now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting a quality and affordable sea vacation is insoluble, because in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most of the accommodation facilities have already been booked by the end of September," the authors of the letter note, stressing that the opening of charter transport in August will not significantly affect the sea traffic.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry (RST), in the event that the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when charters will be renewed is not yet, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly set up programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary on-board flights,” says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Department of the Russian Air Transport.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it will not affect the position of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, do not count on excitement for sure - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but excitement is not worth waiting for.
“For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season”, – agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NFPA of compensation payments established by law within the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The delivery of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions according to the established norms is provided for in Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of February 16, 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free delivery of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers in the days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions, due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these norms, the FNS of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the income in the form of the value of milk issued to employees in the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the provisions of Article 217 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation is exempt from taxation.
The Moscow “Gazstroybank” was left without a license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations at the Joint-Stock Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSC Gasstroybank conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank’s assets led to the creation of grounds for the credit organization to implement measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in the conduct of dubious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for the period of validity until the moment of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSC ACB "GAZTROYBANK" - participant of the deposit insurance system.
We remind that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total per one depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the report, on August 1, 2016, the assets of JSC JSC GASTROYBANK took 335 place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has died in Syria.
Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are precisely the risks involved in traveling to the war zone - is to persuade people to ever make the same choice," Akundji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reed says he is confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrik Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, and as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland “with some degree of confidence.”
Reed later said that he did not talk to Clinton directly about whether she would put Garland forward, and simply built assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "skip the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republicans who blocked Garland’s nomination were “brave” and “helpers” of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says erotic calendars for 'women as well as for men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Ballmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muse.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because “Playboy is for men.”
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
“We need to get back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moskvich will be given souvenirs about unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memorial that will tell how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the specialists of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to correctly choose an online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative basis, rules of delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The annex will give recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so on," Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memorial is currently under construction.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the name of the second suspect in the organization of the diversion in the Crimea.
Detained persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia, who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtai Andrei Romanovich.
"They all give acknowledging testimony," the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporizhzhya region Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt at the interrogation.
The FAS fined Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles., the website of the agency says.
"The fine for Google for violation of antitrust legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay a fine in the near future,” said Alexey Dotsenko, deputy head of FAS.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS established that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones sold on the territory of Russia, the store of Google Play applications only provided that other applications of the corporation will be installed on the device.
Among these applications there is also a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Part 1 of Article 10 of the Federal Law “On Protection of Competition” (abuse of the dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a favorable effect on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations, including," said Elena Zaeva, head of the Office of Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects the collusion of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The chain of shops "New Book" has been fined for the sale of the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide", reports the city news agency "Moscow".
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provocative or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents."
The Ostankino district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor administration.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it is a work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow are undergoing checks on the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow will be held the evening of the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow will be held the evening of the memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to commemorate it on their homeland," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
In the evening invited close friends of the Unknown, including poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, artist Boris Messerer, president of the Moscow Academy of Sciences named after Pushkin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kibevsky, for Moscow.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to hold a panhide on the sculptor in New York, presumably, until August 14.
The ultimate consumer is guilty: who actually buys records?
Single men of middle age love vinyl.
And until you start to smear the comments section with gross insults under the alias of NotallSingle Middle-Year Men, this claim stems from factual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand who want to penetrate a new material object, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album with a high probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of gathering lovers – it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results accurate?
If this blog was a TV news story, the camera would follow me as I walked down the center of bustling Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and gesticulating furiously before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, “Yeah, let’s see.”
Okay, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores have now flooded buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I’m standing close to different people in some of these stores and trying to gauge their age and emotional mood through observation.
A native of Glasgow Stuart, 55 years old, whom I followed from Sister Ray (countdown of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (countdown of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and walks around the shop for a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn’t chase him home), go along the lines of the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles stems in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they just came out, and buy items he sold when he was young and in the mall.
"A lot of what I'm getting is the late '60s, the early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely introverts who like their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink very much.
That's my shortcoming.
Wes, a 25-year-old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
He did, however, notice a new wave of people being influenced by noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy back their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store, such as Phonica, to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some older customers, in particular, are being offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel the thrill of the digital world and prefer to permanently remove familiar envelopes for records, items that evoke memories of a troubled youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling the void or possessing material things as a kind of reassurance,” Wes says.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the album rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month still haven’t listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don’t have a record player.
At this stage of news reporting, I would probably look seriously puzzled, scrolling racks with Bosanov’s collections.
The “trophy” aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, noticed working in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put a regiment on it,’” he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
The more the product, the less the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they are a little under twenty who are just getting acquainted with it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores – the latest synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns – it’s nice to see the diversity in their customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish by standing 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends money.
She doesn’t make much money, she says, so collecting records isn’t a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ... ", - she is immersed in dreams with a sigh full of love.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Fashionistas.
As I create the illusion that I’m looking at jeans-covering shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
To the left is a staircase, the wall of which is set with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one looks — perhaps because they’re just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for a while, there is almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most to have is the one that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl aficionados who exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work at school or in the office.
But they clearly don’t spend Thursday morning strolling through record stores on Berwick Street, leafing through records and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's polar shark is the world's longest-living vertebrate
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female aged 272 to 512 years and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by the Kale authorities to take down dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, Kale authorities said the state should be able to take down a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple dishes for several euros.
The prefecture of Calais stated that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They said that brick-and-mortar shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lilly’s court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel people running 72 brick-and-mortar stores, but said the problems of Calais prefecture were “completely understandable.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said baccalaureates, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely shabby conditions.”
He said the spaces provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was under threat of demolition was the Children's Cafe Book Jungle at the camp, which operates for no profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and counseling on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without being accompanied in the camps.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years.”
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, said Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young freelancers to educational programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Bodybuilder.
The programs are focused on the children's audience, so most of them will be in play form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in the bay area, invites to the cruise presentation "My little town".
On August 11, in the branch library No. 1 will be held a local history lesson "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the branch library No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "Land of the native past fate".
And in the branch library No. 4 in Suragevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the kids from the northern microdistrict, the branch library No. 3 will hold a game program "Fiskult-hello!".
Britain stops on silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass allows them to take gold
The impressive UK series in Rugby-7 was crushed at the final hurdle by Fiji's team in the final on Thursday night when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a masterclass in possession of the ball, tackle, evasion, support of the game, running the lines and the rough force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver - the third in Britain in a day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Rugby-7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa won on the way.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could have come back to negatively affect them in the final.
But despite everything, Fiji won in such a way that it is impossible to beat a team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK – but probably not – that at least one Briton will wear a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a trip to the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is astounding.
Fiji started out great, for the sake of fun, beating off Britain’s attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerrir Tuwai added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the United Kingdom barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent interception attempt kept mountain man Leon Nakarava from scoring a third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremala made a touchdown in the right corner, and the United Kingdom lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another after the restart and there was still more minutes on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 in the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby sevens, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is.
Britain made massive substitutions for half the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton picked up an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game has long followed the path of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the complete joy of Fiji’s approach.
Mata William decorated a Fijian cake that didn’t need beautifying, another attempt at the last second.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier the same day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-final, and the UK slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt each – the difference British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with the help of some magnificent footwork, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last-ditch interception by Marcus Watson, the 15th brother of England's team, Anthony, ensured victory—and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win a rowing coach battle with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, this boat had three votes, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as they aspired to the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, not fully reflecting the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold row is a battalion of ready-made hands that contribute to the gradually increasing victories that matter, and there are no hands that played a more important role than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don’t, they go everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December of 2013.
Trio was lucky enough to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap to a minimum if it can be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed a payment, so I had to fix it quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The raft itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her back, said: “I was emotional wrecked this week, maybe it’s a little too much, but it means so much.”
It just goes to show how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so does Robin.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
“I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It’s important not to get involved now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything amazing.
We weren’t expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to go out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple of years to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the period for the destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food products prohibited for import into Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was extended several times, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
In Russia, it is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country to circumvent the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tonnes of prohibited products were withdrawn from sales.
The hunt for the "forbidden"
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees of heat.
So, in the night on Saturday in Moscow places will be short-term rain, possible thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m / s.
During the day it is expected to rain with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orlov, Kursk and Voronezh regions, Dni.ru reports.
Rainfall is unlikely in the next week.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are in violation of the organization’s rules.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time that the WTO has made a decision against Russia,” the WTO said in a statement on its official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “of a comprehensive nature”.
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the United States in resolving disputed issues in the WTO undermines the principles adopted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the refusal of the Americans to approve the second term of the South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not turn to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization created in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's Administration Changed
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Vaino as the head of his own administration, former deputy Sergei Ivanov.
Vladimir Putin has carried out reforms in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino said during the meeting that he considered important anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as the head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the restructuring will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who led the work in the presidential administration for a long time, has left, effectively built up the activities of the AP.
Instead came the deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino - a man who knows perfectly well the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish financial company Bohuslav Mazets.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are diversifying our supplies now.
Within the next four years, the main supply areas for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,” said Mazetz.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that a Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 delivered almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases rose to 49.8% from 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the antitrust office of Poland did not agree to the creation of a joint venture "Gazprom" and its European partners for the construction of the gas pipeline "Nord stream-2".
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland had left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas on Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The North Stream 2 capacity auction will be held in 2017, and in the fall of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the Polish side’s intention to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, the company’s deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased the purchase of gas from Russia by 42%.
The Deputy Prime Minister of Gazprom added that the very fact of submitting the Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean that the negotiations have ended.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Petro Naimski, the Polish government’s gas and energy infrastructure commissioner, said the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s gas and energy infrastructure commissioner, Petr Naimski, said his country could abandon its supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
“Nord stream-2” provides for the construction of two strands of sea gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering a question from journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security are not recorded there.
Observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the Network appeared a video of a passenger plane Yak-42 landed at Ufa airport, which rolled out of the runway for 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
The crash occurred at 4.30 a.m. Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates in normal mode.
The Volga investigative control on the transport of SKR began to find out the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN Special Envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura considers the fact of the incident undisputed.
Such statements came ahead of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack with the use of toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aviation dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called thrown.
Later, the Ministry of Defense of Russia accused the happened opposition group "Harakat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki".
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I smelled gas, started to burn my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the witness said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out on a daily basis, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered "insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egelann, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to deliver aid and evacuate the sick and wounded to the city every week.
"We have to send bulky cargo from a column of trucks to the area where the roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain are mined," said Mr. Egelann. - But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.
Consultations between U.S. and Russian representatives on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” are continuing in Geneva.
How Russia opened the “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, Russia announced on August 11 that a three-hour cease-fire regime would be in place daily starting on Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essential items to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to reverse the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions broke out in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, and there are no Russians among them.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any of the terrorist groups, but the country's Interior Ministry has rushed to say that Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained in connection with the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, said police colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the country's interior ministry "is confident that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
"It is too early to draw conclusions," said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to the statements of the police general Sithichai Srisopacharoenrata, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees on the busy streets filled with diners at restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
The Russians are not among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturismo reported.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission for the development of a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in electing the country’s prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country’s army commander, Praut Chan-ocha.
At this step, he said, the army was driven by a continuous political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, introduced curfew and censorship, and ousted protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok is in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat, announced in January 2014 a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred, which injured 28 people, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions produced unknowns on motorcycles.
The authorities have stepped up security in the capital and have enlisted military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In the Dry Lodge, the development of conditions began.
As it became known, the government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the gold ore field Sukhoi Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants in which the capital will not be at least 25% of the public interest.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the government a draft order and conditions for the auction of the largest undeveloped gold ore field in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources "K" familiar with the situation told.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
The representative of Alexander Khloponin, the deputy prime minister, who oversees the subsoil use, said that the project has not yet entered the official’s office.
"The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the government's order is issued, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender can be held as early as October," - said in the Ministry of Nature.
According to Y, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the version, which was sent for approval to the ministries and FOIVAs in July (there is a "Y").
The first is the presence in the capital of the applicants at least 25% of the state participation.
The second is the refusal of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the FZ mentioned in the draft, as already written "<0xD0><0x9A>" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Dry Log refers to the subsoil of federal value (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "<0xD0><0x9A>" in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroshchenko, and by the Russian Federation.
Who lobbied the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors "U" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of the times: not to give control in the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," - the interlocutor "U", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskaya said that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as financial structure, technological partners".
The "U" interlocutors consider it unlikely that the conditions in the government will be adjusted.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry are the consortium of the largest gold producer of the Russian Federation PJSC "Polyus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostech".
In July, the partners created a joint venture "SL Zoloto", where "Polyus" has 51% of the share, the structure of "Rostech" RT-GR - 49%.
In "Rostech" refused to comment, in "Polyus" said "U", that "of course, are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the statement added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision on the Russian government, the sources said.
Russia’s GV Gold and Canada’s Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotka, have announced the possibility of participating in the development of Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to “U”, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, Sergey Kashuba, head of the Union of Gold Industry of the Russian Federation, estimated the “U” investment in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most of the potential candidates scare away not only the amount of investment, but also the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and technology of working with complex ores is needed, explain the interlocutors of "U" in the industry.
The largest M&A deal was launched in the pension market - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, based on the "Gazfond Pension savings" will be created NPF with the amount of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
About the launch of the procedure of combining four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension savings" - yesterday the owner of 100% of funds of LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of "Gazfond Pension savings".
According to Oleg Byaloshitsky, the general director of this NPF, the association of funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the target period for completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF "Gazfond Pension savings" will become the largest player in the OPP market.
According to data as of March 31, the amount of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As it follows from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
Thus, the group controlled by the O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
“Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,” says Nikolay Sidorov, the general director of NPF “Future”.
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April is going on in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfond" should be merged into NPF "Safmar" by the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF "Trust" will join them.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of increasing control over risks, operational processes and costs,” Safmar said.
The pause in the pooling of funds endured by the “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” may be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds issued by the group.
After the amendments to the resolution of the Central Bank in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought out by one major player,” says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of the financial institutions of AKRA.
Several NPF executives from the top 15 on assets, another possible cause of the pause, called the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which should have been agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
The request "U" in the NPF "Gazfond" also did not respond.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive event, in the long run this decision will be justified.
According to Sergey Okolesnov, general director of the consulting company “Pension Partner”, “Gazfonda Pension savings” has fewer outflows, joining will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofonda" in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy is not advisable, believes Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings "Expert RA".
“The effect of the reduction of the duplicating functions will definitely cover the possible costs of unification”, – said Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of combining four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget is really reduced by half," - said Mr. Okolesnov.
In the Russian rental came the best Disney movie "Pet and his dragon".
Beautiful species of New Zealand, a gracious dragon, breathtaking history and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human infant and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in chases and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he is grown up and in a ribbed bandage, no longer distinguishable from another imaginary forest scavenger - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete discovers the red-haired woman-hero Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the gang of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively drives the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete goes on an accelerated course of "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their heart and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible for the viewer to really start hating or fearing him.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be scary at all, with a good muzzle of a bulldog, an airliner's wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, mumbled, even crouched and, fortunately, does not say, but he always wants to flatter, it is beneficially different from all known cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, they begin to cry desperately in the three streams not only small spectators, but also adults.
Amazingly good and underage Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuosically betrays a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film "The Dragon's Pit", mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and feature film, and make it this summer's most soulful film?
It was a miracle that helped.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There are musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this good fairy tale we read the traits borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other cute children's paintings.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon is not as stunningly beautiful as the Jungle Book, and there is no skilled villain in it like Kate Blanchett in the role of stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from the magical Disney castle, director Lowry will receive once again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan".
Working on Pete and his Dragon tandem, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks have embarked on an ambitious new project about an underage boy based on the eponymous fairy tale of James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov to face new charges
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found shortcomings in the case of their subordinate.
That the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the issue of limiting access to criminal case materials, but the meeting did not take place in the end, and investigators told us about the presentation made by the prosecutor’s office,” – quotes RBC lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed out to investigators the inconsistency of the qualification of the case and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to eliminate the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, says Ms. Dinze.
As reported by "U", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the journalist RBC the wording of "shaking the political situation in the direction of instability" and "the overthrow of power illegally".
Kommersantboscosport correspondent Alexander Zilbert lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch at the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life is going to freeze for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, there is a settlement and eviction from the village without stopping, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning in one of the temporary tents the heads of all Olympic delegations stretch.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours are located, consider the model - it was put into operation one of the first and even demonstrated to all those who did not meet.
That's the problem with hot water, then, I'm sorry, with toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinicians began to come, but only fuck with some substance on the floor, and everything.
Their floors, you see, are innovative.
You can't wash them humanely.
Let us know these floors - ordinary laminate!
In general, we have achieved a change of the cleaning company and now with this all OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive moat, places filled with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence along the perimeter, along which walkers.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems seem to be the most urgent for the domestic team.
On the registration stand hang two ads: printed "Please do not throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "I accept as a gift badge.
The stand itself drowns in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the headings of the brochure: "Memory of infectious diseases for traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid in drowning, getting a foreign body into the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of heart and lungs.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, a favorable outcome is not waiting for everyone.
Of course, in the location of the national team of Russia there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including a relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is actually the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door - an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are afraid believe in it.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even more upliftment of spirit hangs the announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
On the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill spiritual care about athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the protopriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order moleben and other requirements by phone...
In general, in the territory of the village there is a Center of meditations and religious rites for representatives of all religions.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, it was the sleeping co-workers of the new cleaning company.
I think that in readiness at any time to throw on washing innovative floors they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold stairs.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time acquaintance – Vitaliy Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batutists, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
Complaining about the big account is nothing, - shares the impressions of a well-deserved coach of Russia. - We live in two, beds, of course, are almost knocked down, but this is uncritical.
The bathroom is one in four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not cause confidence, but things can be put.
"No, you're kidding, their tea is over!" - says tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it represents a space of 2.7 thousand square meters. m and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
They give out 60,000 servings a day for free.
The menu options are as follows: "Best of Brazil", "Kitchen of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I looked, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I did not find soup in any of the units of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? - Kuznetsova wonders. - No tea!
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, welder.
And a kettle.
But in general, so that you understand, we have even worse food on the courts.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally chose a steamed cod and fries in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the food value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
To be honest, it was edible.
I don't even understand why this turn is always at the local McDonald's.
The thirsty, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Tricked cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provocative, you might say.
To receive a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me by a girl from WADA.
But he didn't attack it.
I mean, I'm a patriot, naturally.
The situation has already worsened on the second question: “If I received a notification of doping control, should I go to the doping control point immediately?”
I stopped at option B: “No – I have one hour.”
I lost, so to speak, my vigilance.
I have forgotten that WADA does not have to wait for relaxation.
In general, you need to be there immediately.
Well, in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
I thought for some reason that if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I, by the way, difficult!), then I can use bio-supplements to get “additional nutrients to increase my productivity.”
Anne, don't let it!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not prohibited, but urgently, in several proposals respond.
This is WADA playing unfairly!
What's the matter, Russia? - mockingly asks the leading quizzes.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbaev and all our bloodless team.
That’s why I focused and won an unfortunate T-shirt.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I took to the fitness center next door.
I’m interested in counting trainers.
He hit 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete was found in this accumulation of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let him who does not know how to play be trained!
But in the nearby polyclinic, one of our guys was sitting.
Turn to the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as in the whole village, nowhere spit, hangs a device for the issue of condoms.
There's an encouraging cry on it: "Feast with a condom!"
Further, it remains only to twist the gland, resembling the handle of the door lock, and the condom, made of natural Amazonian latex, is ready to fall out of the device.
I took one, just to remember.
The athletes will not be absent - they brought them 450,000.
Just for a festive and festive time in the Olympic Village there is an entire entertainment center.
Next to him, just in case, there is a plaque reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million per day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What is it? - I am interested in a comrade in the form of the Ukrainian team, who actively uses a wild toy.
I could, of course, just say that he does not want to talk to a person in the form of a Russian national team, and that is all.
Here, by the way, by some strange stream of circumstances in the eyes of the snatched from the guys in yellow-blue.
The most played team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at every corner, it takes at least three hours.
But if it is walking, and not riding on electric cars, you will open a house of the Canadian team with a salmon at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with a post office.
And late in the evening, you will sit beside an olive tree hanging with colorful ribbons in memory of friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you'll be under the accompaniment of a machine that will indiscriminately spray liquid to kill insects, think of eternity.
This is about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was still breathing, watching as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, real fans left the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I received the first.
Maybe I’m even the only Muscovite to see how it happened – not to mention, of course, those who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a true fan can understand this.
Imagine this: a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs, as always at night, wake up and start screaming at each other without malice, but very loudly.
And threatening to move the furniture.
In the kitchen there is a faucet - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the television schedule, so I just kept control of the channels Match, First and, just in case, Russia - although it is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the homeland of repeats, the whole sport there for some reason in the record.
The series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, at the "Match" - all night the young man shouted in the news releases first about the great semifinal of Deriglazov--Shanaev, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of basketball - the United States-- Australia.
I can’t say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing and won the first half.
They put in the place of the Americans of their own greatness.
As a result, they lost, but, as is now expressed, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the battle with Di Francesco is approaching, and on the screen no changes.
In a slight panic, I begin to peel the channels.
This feeling, for the second time in a row, turns.
All right, let's go deep, to the cable.
There's no fencing on any of the themed Matches.
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
Texting and tweeting on some sports sites doesn’t suit me.
Sudden surfing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the site "First", it turns out, there is a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this moment of time.
I click on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deryglazova counterattacks perfectly, goes forward on the points - and clearly begins to pull the time.
The Italian plays almost the entire part.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesco throws himself at Deriglazov, who retreats, time runs out, an Italian woman injects.
Victory!
After a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
I'm the first one to see it with my own eyes.
The insane, the faithful, the accomplices.
The spiritual management of Muslims (DUM) in Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force the young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
The administration says that this “does not in any way infringe” on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, the Kazani say that up to 60% of the parishioners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar “will not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in Tatar language.
According to the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
“For those who say it’s ‘heavy’, in every large mosque we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge,” Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that “the decision has already come into force” and today in all mosques sermons “must be already in Tatar language”.
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine “Shura” with typical sermons in Tatar language.
The Imam, who does not speak well enough in Tatar, "may thoroughly prepare for them."
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday sermons are held exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and "Aniler".
However, emphasized Mr. Mukhametshin, the management sets the task for all students to master both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no violation of the Muslim Netatar," Mr. Muhammetshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, major part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will still be read in Arabic, in mosques will remain lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhammetshin said that there was no serious threat of the expulsion of the Tatar language from the mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of the Executive Committee of the WCC Rinat Zakirov said: "Mechets are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were removed from this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the VCT "consider it correct".
The interviewed “U” imams, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties in understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people do not understand the language.
Of course they will be sad.
"We have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, the sermons in Russian are closer even to many Tatars, since "Russian in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that in the mosques will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
God will show us the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
They are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
There are many foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we spent four years in the Russian language,” says Imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will “reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
The end of the sermon will be different.
But time will tell.
“It will only be easier for me, for example, because the Tatar language is my native language,” Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the FSIN was put on trial
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow has approved the indictment on the investigated SCR GSU criminal case on the theft of budget funds allocated to the needs of the FSIN of Russia.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy will appear before the court, which caused FSIN damage in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Prosecutor General’s Office sent a criminal case against the former Director of the FSIN of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the FGUP “Center of information and technical support and communication of the Federal Enforcement Service of punishments” to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court (FSIN).
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of the SCO of Moscow under Part 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, resulting in serious consequences), Part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud, committed using their official position, in a large way).
In addition, Kryvolapov is accused under Part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated by the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal the budget money, the participants of the group developed a scheme according to which the company under its control FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and implemented at prices that were inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between him and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found in the accounts of the Samara branch of FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash received personally Mr. Raymer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case in respect of which has been allocated to a separate proceedings.
Nikolai Kryvolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found unknown origin of the cartridge to the award gun, which allowed him to present an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim to the accused for compensation of material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Footballer Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of former footballer and then member of parliament Hakan Shukur and conducted searches at two of his family's homes.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month.
Forward, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".
We are talking about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan who considers himself the organizer of the military coup attempt that took place on July 15.
Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gulen's organization included his father in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and was in favour of the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
He hasn’t spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective striker of the Turkish national team: in his assets 112 matches for the national team and 51 scored the ball.
In 2013, Haqqani Shukhur left his parliamentary post due to the start of a corruption investigation around Erdogan’s party and its immediate entourage.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and ties to opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media employees can expect lengthy prison terms ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made a year, of which the screens reach an average of 20-25 tapes.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, in which huge budgets are pumped up," he said.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian youth educational forum “Tavrida” began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants - teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region), the lawyer of the former deputy governor Nikolay Sandakov Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> was detained.
According to the "U-South Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> was called today to the investigative department of the SCR Miass to present the charge in the case of the year-old ago about the infliction of beatings.
Then Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> went to the place of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"It was originally initiated against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolay Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akuli<0xC4><0x87>," - says Sergey Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> became a lawyer for the former deputy governor in early August.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has taken on the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "dirty" enterprises of the country - the Karabakh medeplating plant.
The Karabakh medical melting plant was founded by an English joint-stock company led by Leslie Urkvart in 1910.
In Soviet times it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually ensured the viability of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the operation of the Karabakh mede-melting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation on Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise was transferred to the management of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.
The head of the South Urals called the tremendous changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashmed" moved to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, allowing to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of the "Karabashmed" JSC is the reconstruction of the converter remodel.

Users of the network laughed at the photos, in which an elderly man installed a stirrup on the beach and turned it into a springboard for jumping into the water.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the group "My Taganrog" in the social network "VKontakte", due to which many decided that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was dubbed a "budget high" and "mobile springboard".
Many praised the man for his inventiveness and "smoothness", and some drew attention to the fact that the man is seriously at risk of getting hurt when jumping from his height, since he installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea in the photo.
"Firstly, we do not know what depth there is, the beach can be bulky with a sharp descent by a meter right behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with the right ability you can jump from a couple of meters," - wrote the user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ

As a result, the budget of the region has not received more than 5 million rubles, and the city fine is about 21 million rubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who is in custody on suspicion of corruption, and has applied for a parliamentary mandate, did not provide in time in the election signature sheets for participation in the elections to the State Duma and was removed from the election race.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of Democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to a Democratic Party server hack, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources.
To impose sanctions, President Barack Obama’s administration will have to officially blame the attack on Russia’s servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that the U.S. generally prefers not to name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hack of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which responsibility was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, writes the publication.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before making a decision to disclose the information, they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in the bilateral relationship.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile application market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install along with the Google Play store other applications.
According to the results of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said Deputy Head of FAS Alexei Dotsenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days after the entry into force of the decree.
The FAS concluded that the law on protection of competition should be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the solution and only then determine with further actions: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion of "Ehu Moscow" was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat’s “Anime” Effect Criticized as a Caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by the anime, but some reviewers say it is racially touchless.
With the help of the Lenses tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to make a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, warping features of tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become well-known.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of promoting dark skin on their faces or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth, and puffy bristles, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians — “yellowheads.”
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions were pointing to a more serious company problem related to diversity.
Reports circulated on Wednesday and followed outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented that the lens was intended as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for experts who know nothing about racism, the lens has reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were actively shared, said the lens was “insulting and at least embarrassing.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue with a side-by-side comparison of a very crude caricature of Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, but to a high degree debilitating yellow.
Snapchat isn’t the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean they’re more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said in an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Kathy Zhu, “it’s much harder to go unnoticed than it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of personnel in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white management of the company, consisting only of men, and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Zhu, who is herself an American of Chinese descent, wrote: “Either they didn’t have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they had non-white people working, but they don’t hold positions that can be safely and openly expressed.”
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat hasn’t answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and on active attempts to involve internal resources.
Zhu, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: “I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say that’s not going to happen.”
Military leadership has distorted intelligence about ISIS, reports the congressional commission
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the groundwork for what is happening on the ground, the congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican chairmen of the House of Representatives Committee on Armed Forces Affairs, the Intelligence Committee, and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found “widespread discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said they were underestimated by the American authorities.
The Central Command, known as the Centkom, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Central Intelligence Agency’s top command tended to give a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorism actions than is corroborated by real-world data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies.”
“What happened at the Central Committee is unacceptable: when senior leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said House Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The problems with leadership in Centkom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report elaborates on the shortcomings that have constantly arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration’s leadership ordered the falsification of the reports, it does claim that analysts felt that the Zentcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements, and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events,” the report said.
For example, a Zentcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at returning Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, this is certainly known,” House Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top leadership of the U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service forged intelligence documents from the command to mitigate the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow, according to a report published on Thursday.
An additional investigation, not yet completed, is being carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published on Thursday their own data, which agrees with some of the conclusions of the Republican operational group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Zentkom created an overly closed procedure for intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party’s chief representative on the committee.
This procedure, Schiff said, “has stalled the issuance of intelligence documents,” has damaged the morale of analysts, and “does not adequately reflect divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom’s analysts to adjust their findings to a “definite or political interpretation.”
Preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon’s chief inspector, opened after complaints from analysts at Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the Chief Inspector’s investigation continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria achieves its goal (as is now claimed by more and more Defense Department officials).
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George W. Bush’s administration, due to the protests of many analysts, was in favor of a small number of troops in Iraq and not a single one.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team came to the conclusion that despite public statements about the reverse, airstrikes on oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it built a temporary non-combatant.
But the discovery was not spread outside the Central Command, the Times newspaper reported in September.
The then-Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate that many MPs found to be an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins 4 consecutive times in women's ice hockey on the grass, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's ice hockey team, when the Americans won over the Indian team with a 3-0 score.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam says she’s not sure she’d ever do something like that.
“I don’t have a mind,” she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
That's what she knows: the Americans score 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan lost 2-0 on Thursday.
Teams from the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who will take the second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, shortly after the quarterfinals begin.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans have made a noise here with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first took a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to make the finals.
Then came 2012, when everything didn’t work out for her and her teammates.
The following year, Englishman Coegg Parnham was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training,” said Bam.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Beam opened the account in the first half of the game by throwing an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and abruptly sent the ball to the goal, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
Just like Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the unrest of the Olympic Games - the "day" of jumping on a trampoline
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem immutable and inevitable, it is a furious combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself, there is that burning torch that is passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in a row in a cafe and not hear about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecki or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Cloe.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is participating in the Olympic Games for the first time, could well be among the celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing man.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline jumping competition.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Far from the center, partly in the shade, there are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long his reign.
But if I am allowed to speak out in defense of my personal passion, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on a trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many people I interviewed were unaware that they even belong to the Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share male awards, while the Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dune Dune from China and Rosey McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have the charm of an outsider, in particular, because for the unenlightened ear they are more associated with circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-based enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential — it’s a caricature of endless jumps — but also the grace of gymnastics and water jumping, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", meaning "tramplein for jumping into the water".
The contenders for the victory jump on a giant trampoline, taking off in the air for almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and jumps) until the final landing on the legs.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and "flight times", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, there-and-here in the field.
They seek not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of the camera, to another annoying edge: a world or Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the viewer slip.
But I think it gets a little tired of watching the games.
From him jumps on the trampoline give a respite.
The direction of the batutist is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
And in them, of course, can not do without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy rush to the finish, no jumps in length, only a strange, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
Women's qualifiers, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast in the hour of the day according to Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also in the hour.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of the daytime program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in the general dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to coveted views and objectification — as recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States, according to the Wall Street Journal — Dooley is just waiting for his new fan-favorite crowd.
"Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Riots in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were mortally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a rift?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a firm ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights activists said the government’s response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest sites, allegedly shot at the end of last year or earlier this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly an example of democracy – human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions – the opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that the dissidents were actually forced to remain silent.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or exiled to remote deserts.
But that may change.
“If people are constantly oppressed and left with no other option but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; the struggle for this uncertain, contentious border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, flare up now.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and Internet service has improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries Amhara from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that's also changing.
“We will act together under a single principle,” said Mulatu Gemecu, Oromo’s leader.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many in Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at recognizing early signals of discontent and using intelligence to obtain data and defeat opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalenje, emerged from nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not trust the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that as a result, this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be elections that the government had stalled and then falsified the results.
During the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, though in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed gratitude to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not stop the growth of internal discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by the Tigray, and anti-Tigrai hatred on social media is becoming pervasive.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
“And it will be difficult to get through this tight rope,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he joked when he repeatedly this week claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to address the American people sensibly.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of unrest, in a awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably didn’t mean.
By making this assumption at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early on Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was simply ephemeral.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against the backdrop of a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton have been making competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the topic.
Again resorting to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and said he thought her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew widespread criticism, almost expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course, I'm joking."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, watching how they act, and then ‘explaining’ them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s wary of his statements and knows they’re vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening the rhetoric for a broad electorate, Trump has taken on an even more hurtful tone in recent days as his ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton with a big lead in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going with her to Florida.
While Trump typically tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the subject of heightened attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump’s most famous deputies, has made serious efforts to defend the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the validity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown little organization, he called it non-threatening, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it happened because he brought troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, has allowed ISIS to develop because it has failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for inciting every word of his and bias against him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" television experts who were trying to solve it, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as an overstatement that he is not fit for president.
A once-extended coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Werb coffee house was cluttered, taking only a cash spot in Williamsberg, which didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was evicted from her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Shop "Soup Sherry", which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of biscuits.
Locals mourned her as the last loss in the rejuvenating city.
Artist Molly Krabaple tweeted: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea hotel is destroyed, and Werb is now a soap shop.”
But even though New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The revived Werb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new “Verbe” has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
At the head of the new “Verba” is Sisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee house, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Werbe in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to promote it in a new location, he said he would be happy to go for it.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in the same form.
Werb works with the same distributor of bagels and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old “Verba”.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and toppings are available from capers or fried onions.
There are dishes of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but now prepares freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he had paid attention to the steady flow of old regular customers.
“Many former customers have also been squeezed out of prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliver was one of such clients.
Oliveira, 34, had previously lived in Williamsberg and had frequent visits to the Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verba,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time client, has been a loyal visitor to Werb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing.
“At fifteen minutes of eight, every day, like clockwork, I came, and my bagel was prepared for me with oil and with all the fillings,” he said.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he will change something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he was not offended that the soap shop had once taken over the old place.
What’s more, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Werb, using coffee from a coffee brewed in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also fell in love with this cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other benefits to the new location.
The local juice point plans to pour in bottles and sell cold-cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed down.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that by going inside and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long have I wanted to feel this aroma,” he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Plotnaya Trap"
In March 1933, shortly after taking office as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and the Maryland tortoise soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - blackberry pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Cowe added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
Koua's latest book, "Ragu in Chinese," was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a flat in the Lower East Side through food in his book House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new collaborative work, The Thick Table, which will be published Tuesday by Harper Publishing, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Demonstrating to some extent their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Cow, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meat roulette, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussing food in the Depression era.
“Roulettes were in high demand,” said Siegelman.
There was a peanut roll, a cookies roll, a bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed you to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine that you have eaten as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe's wrinkled.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. The “thick table” describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” Cowe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and pastries, became the main foods; pastries are “a great way to recycle groceries,” Siegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of salt.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years has been the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dinner table was not a success,” Cow said.
Zigelman added: “It was very strange.”
Peanut oil is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical of many home-cooking recipes.
As never before and never since, home-care professionals—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers,” to take on the challenge, and to turn a burqa like rubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The “thick table” is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of "let them eat pies".
Publicly bragging about the simple farmer’s stubbornness of the state of Iowa in his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
“He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce,” Cow said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economist who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House “using not only the most bleak food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked.”
Many of the culinary practices of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and on how science has been used in food preparation.
The spouses say that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother – that she could not throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of being careless about food,” Cowe said.
Zigelman recalls: “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was one unfortunate incident with the profilers.
When the plates at Eisenberg’s left, they and Coe got a dessert they made at home: a dessert made from blackberry, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called blackberry mousse,” Zigelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes throw names.
There were no whipped creams, only blackberries, a little flour, sugar, water and a crust.
Everyone reluctantly loaded a spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of a confident budgeter, he told his wife: “A little rubbed Greek walnuts would not interfere here.”
The arrest of the defendants in the case of the mass fight at the Khovan cemetery is extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under arrest the figures in the case of the mass fight at the Khovan cemetery, satisfying the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14 at the Khovan Cemetery there was a mass fight of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, which resulted in the death of three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov were charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Holodec during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters for how much we need to raise the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are done.
Economists are now summarizing the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks,” said Golodec.
Commenting on the proposed scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development Alexei Kudrin for raising the retirement age by half a year each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.

Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen has called for an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d’état,” Gulen told the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that “if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey.”
However, G<0xC3><0xBC>len denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court earlier in absentia arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempt of a military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead Companies to Reimburse Legal Services Expenses in Case of Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to recover the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with a lawsuit over a patent for a hepatitis C drug with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents relating to Gilead drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a court filing Thursday that Gilead had the right to recover the costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the lab-based sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
The U.S.-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darvish of Manbij's SDF-allied military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State declared a $3 million income from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book's tribute to her.
Clinton’s potential vice president, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and violates his past promises to publicize his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service’s audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic candidate’s declaration.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the end of the checks.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitta Romney and other fellow Republicans in 2012, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed hold of the issue and released an online video on Friday that focused on prominent Republicans who had persuaded Trump to publicize his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done without exception for decades: to make public his tax returns,” she told the gathering.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business reviewer on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believe that perhaps the case is still pending.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under scrutiny by the IRS, and that Trump was “fearful” not of the tax collection agency but of voters.
Clinton’s election campaign released tax returns up to the year 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was sourced from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from straying into human settlements — throwing them with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Committee on Nature Conservation, took over its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step method to protect their homes and crops.
Many have used spears to defend themselves.
On Friday, World Elephant Day will be dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we’ve invented a set of tools ... we’ve seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, resulting in them being much more confident that they’ll be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” said Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the border crossing elephant and send signals with the horn.
If you can't get rid of it, you're going to throw away the so-called "chili cloud."
The chili powder, mixed with the soil, is placed with a cotton ball in a condom, and its end is screwed, only the wick remains outside.
When ignited, the condom cracks with a noise, spraying a small powder of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to move the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats have yet to return to Turkey, who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data was brought by the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry Mevlut Cavusoglu in conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations,” the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
In July, an attempted coup d’état took place in Turkey.
The authorities of the country officially stated that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them the military ranks of the highest and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for the removal of the phone code of Israel at the "request" of the Arabs, said the channel RT News
A French director of Jewish origin has sparked a media scandal by discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have Israel’s phone code on its list, with employees citing “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the Holocaust documentary The Show, expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the phone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states, where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the stand of the hotel administration.
The response he received there, Lanzman said, “shocked him.”
The hotel clerk said the measure was a "considered decision by the Kempinski hotel chain management."
The reason behind this step has caused even more anger from the director.
“The majority of our Arab guests and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed,” Lanzman, a hotel clerk, said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “terrible disgrace,” the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and precisely in this network of hotels is an even greater shame.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused quite a stir on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “went over” the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any charges, calling the incident “unexamined” and “apologizing” to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel newspaper.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of quick-starters,” Kempinski told the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some participants of the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls, aimed against the interim acting President Michael Temer.
This latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to the portal RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest on the part of Russian firms in conducting business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
Increased trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also predicts that this year Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year’s record in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to screw nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was “systematic non-fulfilment” of the orders of the CEO of the concern “Almaz-Antey”, “dismisses at work” and “loss of confidence”.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in the context of a large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This confirms once again that the defense-industrial complex (DIP) has a lot of problems and the state does not want to attract them increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
The NGO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (ABMs) of sea and land-based.
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the "Polyment-Redut" and "Morphey" air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the breakdown of deadlines under these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began in 2007, and the commissioning was expected in 2013.
“Polyment Redut” should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I get, in a few years of testing, not a single truly successful test has been performed.
True, as far as I can judge, this is not the unequivocal fault of "Almaza", - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay with the commissioning can happen with the S-500.
The experimental and design work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is being planned and everything will be completed within the stipulated time", although in 2014 the agency acknowledged the presence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led “Almaz” since 2011.
Kornev noted that delays in projects can be both the reason for and the reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the CPA and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave the positions at their own request, under a contract of agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place in public, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of the "Almaza" was perhaps a figurehead and resisted the "discharges" coming down from above.
It seems that the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
At the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and does not perform the tasks set.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the fallen managers (the machinations on the ship "Zvezda").
The President personally pays special attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of the OPC managers, seeking to have at hand the loyal composition of the directors, who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but against the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPK, the state has no other tools.
The situation in the defense, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning up” of the managers in the Russian Armed Forces, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the appointment of the Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the well-known saying "You want peace - prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", perhaps there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country are the Navy and the Army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scottishman Callum Skinner is racing on the finish line, as a result of which the British capture the bicycle gold
Scottishman Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the Rio bike track last night, as a result of which the British team trio defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly entered the story, racing through the finish line to snatch the victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the rights to a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoy has since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist participant Jamie Staff.
It was at the time when Hinds was born.
Hoya's departure also created a void that Kian Emadie and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man that British coaches adhered to, seeing the potential in Scotland that was now being realised.
Hindes, Kenny – champions with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes rode on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to intentionally falling on the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain’s competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, “I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stand.”
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then there are five more successful days waiting for the biker.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it’s not out of the realm of possibility to imagine how he replicates Hoya’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in a single Games.
This would allow us to see how Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – brings his score up to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoya's.
The next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which starts today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come here to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knighthood.”
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Doll qualify for the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit of four.
They finished in 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, the day before the qualifying round, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women’s event, which resumes and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Russell Shand, Elinor Barker and Kathy Archibald of Milngavi improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13.260.
Britain’s team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
In fact, after exceptional demonstrations of absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have been weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not least the departure of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first evening race on the bike track, it seems that the legendary now fame of Britain in reaching the tops at the right time may just be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is in jeopardy due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is in jeopardy because the power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant’s owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies granted to support the plant’s operation.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metallurgical plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa’s Portland-based metallurgical plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been ongoing for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum power plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling stake in the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and smaller stakes are held by CITIC, a Chinese company, and Marubeni Corp, a Japanese company.
"AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called “hedged contracts” that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring in their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017,” the company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profit from the 2018 financial year is currently limited to forecasts of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in the form of a “future termination.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to a metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to go into effect in November of this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL’s chief operating officer Steven Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only reality star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, a 20-year-old model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has featured in fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the "Kardashian Family?"), a planned reality-video, in which the whole family of the Kardashian-Jenner (the deboss Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them the universal most beloved uncle of the show-business, pro-Kardashian.
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows devoted to birthdays (Sikrest utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to get this fame somehow and other.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
The thickness is more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of which of the stars will fall on its cover is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years, the magazine’s photos have merged before the official announcement.
Previous women to appear on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more “celebrities who work with models” than “models who are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor fell to Lady Gaga.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as the “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she’s in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who are thriving in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, given her past star of the reality TV show, was always supposed to remain shaky.
In June, one of Victoria’s Secret’s first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them “momentary bitches.”
These sentiments were once again clouded by the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to get stuck on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder tonal cream.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available for a paid subscription.
She sells hand-made photographs of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public law centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the least protected population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector prepares for an effect that will further cut funding for already-capable activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to deal with unjust deprivation of property, and so on — have already been denied, trying to get free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, which are already operating beyond their capabilities, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Law Centers, said that according to a report from the National Association of Public Law Centers’ latest census, thousands of people a year are already being denied.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not overturned, the situation will only get worse.
“Quinland’s public law centers are constantly receiving insufficient funding: that means thousands of people are being denied vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving a violent relationship, people with unmanaged and ruinous debts, families going through divorce, unfairly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected Queenslanders will have to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call on Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palaschuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s election campaign has been put on trial after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s campaign headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after a report that its operations director in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun when they drove in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's election headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "this will not happen."
Director Earl Phillips “drawn out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and put the barrel on Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said in the complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional administration of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the appeal.
“The guns don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after a Republican presidential candidate made a furor, telling North Carolina listeners that “Second Amendment people” — understood as gun owners and his lovers — could take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected.
Trump’s campaign headquarters said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken in support of the violence.
In her complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the election headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insult to action and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks has been slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Presidential candidate from the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern District Court (Charlott).
Britain must steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local communities and across London in general, but across the country as well.
For me, it was exactly that huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult situation on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, which has implemented a program of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investments in a timely manner and within budget, from the T5 – chosen by the best terminal of the airport for five years in a row, to the T2, built in the middle of the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to provide the third runway, confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I’m sure the expansion of Heathrow will be as well.
It is time for us to steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow by securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play in "cats-mouses" on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad-blocking software are a game of cat-and-mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that a desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads, making it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to have bypassed the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of open-source ad blockers and those trying to get around it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficiently profitable article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how they are targeted by advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook said new Adblock filters are causing concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so we’ve focused instead on creating tools like Ad Preferences to put management in people’s hands.
Woman Moved On Swiss Motorway In Episode Of Obvious Suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was moved several vehicles on the highway early on Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morgue in the canton of Vaughan just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police, who call on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident, said.
A criminal case was initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a hit?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case, both involving a man walking in the dark on the highway, a verdict was handed down that motorists could not expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a female police officer — who responded to an emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a way that was warranted, and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those of Earth could ever exist on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's low rotation speed is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a dilute atmosphere like Earth's, and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus substitutes its daytime side of the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
It heats the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella protecting the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly several degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Despite the fact that Venus was once perhaps habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans were evaporating and its water vapor was burned out by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen plummeted, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice President/Chief Manager of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as Colorado Avalanche’s head coach and vice president of hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey activities must match the vision of the organization perfectly.
He must also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions are not met at this time.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 rating in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second preferential trip to participate in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Famer, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oilers Resuming Talks and Suspending Strike
Work strikes on oil workers' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are starting a new round of talks, leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, managed by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the ongoing disputes," the company said in a statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at countering potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cut came after a 10-percent rate cut for contract employees working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to cease oil and gas activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices for crude oil: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts to have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in costs for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The last mission of the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Ribal, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the Calypso Institute.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are only reaching maturity now; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these adult stars throw out large amounts of stellar wind.
When traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars are spinning at a slower rate than less massive stars.
Ribal compares the stars to the dancers: the larger ones make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars," Riball said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with the rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," said Riball.
We want to know more about how, where and why stars slow their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades rotation speeds in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation, related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian dissidents detained in the Crimea, is led by two agencies, writes Kommersant.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in the Crimea.
As previously reported, the resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave acknowledging testimony.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armeniask, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all the accomplices of the subversives managed to be detained.
This, in particular, was the reason for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made on the appointment of Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
The contract with him will be calculated for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the Executive of the Russian Football Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
He is a famous footballer who previously played in Moscow "Spartak" as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as all the same "Spartak", "Zhemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as the national team.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare the team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the Russian Federation set Stanislav Cherchesov the goal to bring the Russian national team to the semi-finals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, as a priority task he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of the head coach of the Russian football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching in the CSKA club.
He announced his departure from the post after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team on himself.
Haunted between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during a long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million people has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia’s success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as a matter of course, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to “reimbursement costs”.
In Namibia, however, primary school education is free of charge.
In addition, secondary education has become free since 2015.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
In comparison with the 1993 figure, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from nearly 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has Africa’s highest free speech rating, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country far ahead of the United States and other wealthy states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating – one of the highest in Africa – in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, with commodity prices falling, Namibia is able to maintain a high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the U.S. and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional assessment methods, is still quite high – almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is one of the countries with above-average incomes, but the authorities insist that their state is in fact a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some of the difficulties that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country, isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers live in the deserts, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia has not thought to give up, the country is solving the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians understood that the neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the income from Namibia’s natural resources needs to be invested in infrastructure and production facilities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek to maximize profits from the sale of the country’s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong government support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state Hague Gyeongbok noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, the president said.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are inexhaustible.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings – racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development – can find themselves on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Golden Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one burial site, known as Grave No. 43, extracted 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon shift to the opaque-looking berry found by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatitsi.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunatitsi is located far from the sea, near the village Yunatitsi Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a golden stripe turned into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, the head of excavations at Tella Yunatsit, dated the find 4600 BC and stated that it is older than the gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow the metal to be dated with perfect accuracy do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I am absolutely sure that Yunats’ gold is older than Varna’s gold.”
It is a finding of extreme importance: in view it is a tiny object, but it is large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as repeatedly and more carefully study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the berry with as much accuracy as possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatitsi is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Today, Tell Yunatitsi is considered to be the oldest “city” in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, metalworking developed rapidly in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to appear around metalworking centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatitsi is perhaps the most ancient, as artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunatize a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” says Boyadjiev, referring to the commonly held view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
Excavations of Tella Yunatsi have been going on since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
There is little left of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunatsi is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figures of birds were found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local worship.
The "Bird's City" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes who came from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-metre walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual notions of ancient human history.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the “gold of Varna”, found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna should have preceded something - something like a tiny gold bean created in Tella Yunatsit.
Porsche has artificially aged the model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit, who work with serial machines.
The retro bow is, for example, in the special color of the body of the Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - in this color is painted even the logo of the model.
In addition, the targa received a branded white graphics along the edges and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel disks, as well as some details of the body design, painted in "white-gold metallic".
In the interior, the retro dashes are noticeably smaller: it is distinguished, by a large extent, by the gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and decorated with black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a car case and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant Porsche Exclusive specialists do not touch steel: the retro-targa by characteristics quite coincides with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 l, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car are reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have launched an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook’s technology, which prevented ads from being hidden on social media pages, has provoked solution developers to block ads for response.
AdBlock Plus has released an “antidote”, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Social network representatives noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of “unblocked” advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus along with commercial ads blocks and many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret over such a policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and the blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, the affected side became users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw advertising where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear in court <0xC2><0xB7> Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmansk region.
The charge brought against a 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for the maximum penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossover Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popular class of cars in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views on the Russian market and intends in the near future to offer our motorists a number of interesting innovations.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550 thousand rubles at the current rate).
For Russians, such a price list is unlikely to shine, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 by the results of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic shell on the lower perimeter of its body can be quite counted as crossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but shown in the photo a large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossover, and the machines with "music" easier to sell.
Five of the seven seats are easy to fold, forming a flat loading area with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 liters.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed mechanical gearbox.
About the dynamic qualities of the machine, the manufacturer is modestly silent, but promises a sparing budget of the appetite owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the requested generation, but with a slightly refined Chinese stylistic design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys a steady demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New will probably be of interest to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines of choice: gasoline 2.4 liters (137 hp) or turbo diesel 2.5 liters (116 hp).
The gearbox - only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a hard-wired "front".
It will be on the stand Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere the representative office of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minveno-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, some of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on transport tax will stop sending by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications about property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed over the years: in summer and autumn they receive a receipt for payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, many will not be able to attend this year.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate changed the procedure of notification of citizens without excessive noise.
Those who are registered in the "Personal account of the taxpayer" on the official website of the agency nalog.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically considered online users and cut them out of the standard, "paper" mailing.
The novelty will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, the possibility to return to the old scheme has and the owners of the account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax department during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the compilation, while the letter will go a few days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on postal mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in the "personal office" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the resulting consequences.
Access to the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password indicated in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any branch of the tax inspection (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
The dispatch of notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which refinements are aimed at achieving very high efficiency, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother the G-Power masters, who took on the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63 to a 571-strong flying cuvaldo with tank aerodynamics and range up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping the “muscles” of the crazy “helix”, the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable “eight”.
But the dynamics of the acceleration up to a hundred improved by indifferent 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of a break for 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably given to him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not travel faster than 210 km/h, then the tuning all-road vehicle with the deactivated electronic collar is able to squeeze 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory original, with the exception of other wheel disks - 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
Luxury division Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking conceptual coupe with a length of 6 m, which will be presented as part of the competition of elegance in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green subbrand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand name.
In the coming years, it is expected that at least four environmental innovations will appear.
