I'm worried about the "stupid man who sees."
I would like to point out that some of the changes that have been made to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament) are a matter of concern to me.
This situation is the cause of the change in the Welsh Parliament's plan to the Parliament.
The political expansion of the A.M. Haru is perhaps the most worrying of all.
A group of people from the Afno party "This Twp and Pwp with Rim Gorch" were worried about Kurama.
For those of you who don't know the meaning of the word "stupid" or "stupid" the meaning of "stupid."
The whole group of Rupma MPs from Plaid AM "are not happy" and the alternative suggestion of Garek.
Theo was "acceptable" about the change in the name of the Afno group to the Welsh Conservative, while he saw the MWP bat fool Hunusamm's small literal leap.
In this context, the letter w lei to the letter u is equivalent to the English pronunciation of yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee on Changes in the Name of the Legislative Assembly has proposed changes to the name of the Assembly, while Bhaneko has said: "The final decision of the Assembly member should be a decisive issue for the members of the House."
The Wales Assembly gave power to change the name of Yasco to the Government in Wales in 2017.
In June, the Commission tabled a wide-ranging proposal for the Wales Parliamentary Assembly to extend its support to the Parliamentary Assembly of Wales.
On the subject of the AM Haruko Medal, the Committee on Wales Members of Parliament or WMPs passed the interest decision while the public deliberations on the MWP option received little support.
A clear alternative suggestion to Harule's suggestion to Garirheko Hunuhunch, the official of Gariek's government, Elin Jones, is more likely to be the subject of an all-encompassing conflict concern than the bill on the change of the law.
The Reformer's Bill included the disqualification of AM Haruko and other changes to the Rules of Procedure of the House, including the Rules of Procedure of the Committee.
The last question on the subject of the Harole Afula Bill has been answered by the Honble Speaker of the Parliament, Garda Tineahrulai.
The President of the Republic of Macedonia changed the name of the Republic of Macedonia to the People's Assembly
Voters in the Afro-Macedonia region voted in favor of a "democratic North Macedonia" or "North Macedonia" referendum.
Grissong's popular vote brought together a decade-long struggle to prepare for the attempted coup d'état of G<0xC3><0xA1>ri<0xC3><0xB3>n, the province of Afonso Afonso along with the province of Macedonia.
Athens is constantly opposed to the efforts of the Afna Group, which represents the Afno-led region of northern Chimequi, and the Afna Group's membership for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, is a vocal opponent of the popular vote.
However, the change in the name of the popular-collection supporter, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, is likely to be worth more than the usual payment between the EU and NATO.

Meanwhile, the political movement continued, with the broadcaster stopping regular programming on Friday for a last-minute rush: a week-long investigation into the allegations led the FBI to agree to plan for Arizona by Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford's Senate Judiciary Committee (CJC) said that the high school party, Uhanlai Kavanaugh, had forced Roxyco Matma to open her clothes at a rate of about 100 per cent.

In the early hours of the morning, a live broadcast of the film was broadcast live on CNN's Bhairhanda.
"I'm the only one who's here," the woman whispered.
"What do you want to say to the people of Sancho?"
She said, "The only thing that's wrong with women is that they're weak."
Flake took the elevator off Hunu Agadi and told him about the release of the office of Garek and the committee there called Dherai Kura.
Justice Committee Kavanaugh has been given the opportunity to conduct a full-fledged Sinteco Mononanlai Agadi Raising Polling Hotline Cables and Broadcast Networks to broadcast live from time to time.
Flake, however, told the FBI that he was "wise" to oppose his nomination for the week, saying that it was only a matter of time before a minority of Democrats voted for him.
Flake agreed to a conversation with fellow Democratic Senator Chris Coons after the meeting with him.
Flake took Coons and some senators in a heated afno-decision-making session.
Flake was not a clear voter for the Republican Party's Republican nominee, Kavanaugh, who was not a member of the House of Representatives.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations against him.

Chinese and U.S. experts have said that China's re-receiving tariffs were designed in the wake of a trade war with the U.S. government's exporter of iron ore (such as Trump's Republican Party's Lei Support Group) Li Tahar Garan.
For China, U.S. Rajdut and Iowaka East, Lamo Time Governor, China's main exporter of agricultural materials, Teri Branstadle sustained injuries in Beijing, U.S. Kamdarharu, Kisanharu and business.
He wrote in an editorial in the Des Moines Register of Newspapers, "China's longstanding commitment to promote free-to-air media advertising is a step forward."
According to Branstadle, "Afno-organized propaganda spread, the Chinese government's use of free speech and free press to take advantage of the old tradition of free advertising in the Des Moines Register."

However, the American woman Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony of the beautiful swearing-in of the woman's faith was shared with a much more confident look behind her.
A new survey by Yugob shows that 41 per cent of respondents are certain or likely to be convinced that Ford's testimony is reliable, 35 per cent of respondents are certain or likely to be convinced that Kavanaugh's testimony is trustworthy.

The Aktiono Kendra Rhanuko Satta, often for the United States of America, was the leader of the five-time major winners of the AFNO Day with AFNOS, and the AFNOS game work was divided neck and neck.
The 48-year-old driver, along with Afonso Carrefour, was not fit for the National Golf Course, where Lamo would regularly arrange a round-the-clock return.
And if the Afno course is not challenging enough, Michaelson will face the nine-game British Open champion Francisco Molinari on Tuesday, as if all four of his best wins were tied with Roma Tommy Flatwoods.

Germany's new warship has been delayed.
The German Navy's all-new Ladakh ship Chiso Cold War-era warship Lai Substitute Garn was commissioned in 2014, while the guilty system and costs of snowballing were reported by Komtima Arkho Aksam Hunechian, Location
According to the newspaper "Die Zeit" quoted by the military spokesperson, the commissioning of the "Rahneland-Flag", the new flagship of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class brand, now has postponed the first part of the conference to 2019.
The portal was launched in 2014 by Samil Hunupartyo, while Delibhari Pasha's ambitious project was successful.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were replaced in 2007 by the former navy of Theo, now known as Bremen-class-frigate.
It is believed that a powerful cannon of the Unihrule, the anti-aircraft gun and the secret technology of the anti-aircraft missile and anti-aircraft missile, as well as a reduced radar, infrared and sound signature, were presented by Garnech.
Other important facilities include the Lamo Marmat period of neck-to-shoulder, the new frigate roulai, the domestic port of Hurubat Tadha, which is likely to be appointed for a two-year convocation.
However, the German naval forces were able to continue to flow across the sea to the leading battleships, such as the warships of the late Bhaniko, and the entry into service of the Garne Bela was the first time for the old Bhaskek, Die Zeitle's comment was missing.
The ill F125 frigate made its headline last year, when the German Navy retook the official Rupma portal, the Rakhine Commission, in denial, and the German Navy retook the Humbergma bluff and the Voss boat landings.
This was the first time that a ship was delivered to the Theo Navy, the ship's manufacturer.
Due to the large number of reasons behind the shooting, the German media cited the important "software and hardware fault" as if the warships deployed in Ladakh's mission were useless.
The main culprit of the software is the fact that the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ship has a crew of 120 sailors, operating alongside the old Bremen-class Ladaku ship, which has a manpower capacity.
Today, it has been reported that the ship's performance will be reduced to a maximum of six times, and the capacity of the Navy will be limited to upgrades in the future.
The German-built "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the 7000-tonne German-built "Rheinland-Pfalz."

Officially, the issue has been raised over time, but the old ship's service-free base has provided some replacement washer and dryer.
He also said that the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class Ladak-class ships could compete with the Pannonian Navy.

Ronaldo rapist Davihru Kharez Garrett but lawyer prepares for trial with German magazine Halne Garrett
Cristiano Ronaldo claimed that the rape was "fake news" against him, that the man who used his name, Garrer, was "wanting a day of outrage."
His lawyer, the German newspaper Der Spiegel, is preparing the case, as is the case published by Accusation.
The Portuguese and Juerves law, in 2009, accused an American woman of raping an American woman named Kathryn Myorga, of being a member of the hospital.
He was charged with paying a fine of $375,000 to keep him calm over the said incident, a report was released on Friday by Day Spiegel.

According to Reuters, Deri Spigallai's case was prepared for the accused by Ronaldo's lawyer, Jasalai Uniharule, who became an "unreasonable reporter of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Kristen Shirtjale, on the basis of the extreme seriousness of the allegations made by the sportsperson, said: "With regard to the compensation for moral damages, the personal rights of young people may have been violated in the last year or so."
The event took place at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.

BREXIT: UK carmaker Gumaakoma 'sadly sorry garnech'
Trade Secretary Greg Clark took over, if Brexit were to be the UK's leading car maker, the British would lose the post of Secretary of Commerce to the "always sorry garnet."
They were concerned that the BBC would take Toyota to the UK to stop the temporary production of the Burnastone Factory, if the UK were to leave the Derby era without a consensus.
In the words of Mr. Clark, "Hamilton needs a consensus."
The Japanese automaker's "no-deal Brexit" has been a wake-up call for the likes of Simana.
In the six-year period, Auris and Avensis produced around 150,000 carrots, like the Bernastone plant, which exported 90% of the rest of the European Union to the rest of the country.
Marvin Cookley, managing director of the company, said: "I think it's the end of March if the UK shuts down production in our factory after being out of the EU.
Honda, BMW and Jaguar Motor Co. (JJC.) feared that the new car maker, Afno, would be forced to do business without a deal.
For example, after Brexit, the BMW will be in Oxford, and the Afno Mini plant will be shut down for a month.
'No-deal Brexit' is a matter of concern to automakers and the supply chain is at risk.

A one-day price hike at the Debishire plant for Toyota would be impossible, the company would have to stop, and production would be halted.
Mr. Clarke, a reviewer at Therasa, planned a six-year plan for the future of the EUSang, "a well-known calculation for checkered babies."
"Hamilaya is a consensual celebration. We all want to have a peaceful consensual celebration. If you want to celebrate success in Jasari Bhanchhu Ahilya, then this opportunity is only for Lin Dinsh and for us to celebrate Pan Dinsh," he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"It's not just Toyota that has been proven by other manufacturers that we've been able to deliver a very successful set of the old supply chain," he said.
Toyota, however, warned that the production could be halted in the near future, but the Lamo period warned that the plant's competitiveness would be less competitive and that it would end up in the middle of the labour market.
Peter Sawalaris, who has been a member of the Bernstein-based Six Nations Union for 24 years, said: "My experience has been that jobs have been lost in the same way.
A government spokesman said: "The future of the EU will be a sustainable and reliable plan for our relations with the EU."
The White House may be late for Trump's meeting in Washington, D.C.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Director General of Road Rosenstein "Arko Weeka Saraico" continued the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh, becoming the White House's top contender.

There have been many reports that the White House did not have a press briefing scheduled for the weekend of September 10th in San Francisco, California.
The event was hosted by Chris Walsh.
When asked about the lack of coverage of the "show speech" of the TV reporter, he said: "The three-year-olds don't agree with the facts."
Then there will be a direct increase in relations between Trump and the press.
"The President's question to the President-in-Office was answered in due course," he said without confirming the fact: "Hamille is a number-one hero."
"If the U.S. president's question were to get a chance to get a direct press release from the U.S. president, the issue would be very difficult to solve," he said.
We've been working on this issue for the past week, and we've been working on it for the past week, and we've been working on it for the past week, and we've been working on it for the past week, and we've been working on it for the past week, and we've been working on it for the past week, and we've been working on it for the past week."
