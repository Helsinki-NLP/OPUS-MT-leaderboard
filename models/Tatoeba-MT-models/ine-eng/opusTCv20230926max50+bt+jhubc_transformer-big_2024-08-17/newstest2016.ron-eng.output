U.N. chief says no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “made this situation unsolvable.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 Figures From Polls That Show Donald Trump Has Real Chances
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to tear Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten out of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leads with a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul’s appointment chances.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race to nominate Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would struggle hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and begin to support him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something transient:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “pleased” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “devastated” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
What’s the closest thing to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “sad” if favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insulting and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe he doesn’t have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament isn’t what the White House is looking for, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to just 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or folded to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of everything.
Some voices say the divisive situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support for Trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush and eventually 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve made up their minds.
A new poll conducted Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say he does not change his vote option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to changing their options.
However, Trump’s main opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it’s twice as likely that voters who say they’ve decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign’s opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to a poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider over someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent declaring themselves “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “nervous at the top.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQs has been long awaited.
New Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be scrutinised closely by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he can give up a few participations and that he gives them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Corbyn’s first parliamentary test in a leading position, coming after he called a “ghost cabinet” and after the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader’s decision to keep quiet about the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative lawmakers and kept the front page of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "remained silent respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Corbyn's phantom cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's top team, arguing through differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says the policy differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position with the European Union and the benefit limit.
Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party was “very clear” in its exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “cap” level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced at the tribune in the past decade since taking over the Conservative Party leadership.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has “external source” ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North has said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from backlash and attacks, committing to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the finance minister, would hold his seat at the PMQs when he could not attend - for example when Mr Cameron was travelling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the helm, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed in his bid.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader’s reasoning, how he leads the House of Representatives and his position among fellow parliamentarians, although critics say he has become a caricature and needs deep reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Young people without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a profession and earn a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take photos of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Salaries Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that such purchasing power will exceed the higher labor costs within the company, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the “storm” created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unpleasantly into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous skirmish with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a grueling qualifying game played shortly after in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put Kyr on the ground, and I would have to put Kyr on the ground."
Although he was last seen making a powder rocket after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was fiercely defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little bit into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he was accused of cramping in the US, but he is not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
But to be serious, he has mastered extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, he has a great family, and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has not had any conflict with other players, he is very respected at dressing, he trains hard, he is in excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basics.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw, which begins on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but supported the return of the original Canberra player in the long term in the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he can mature under the public eye and he has made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think it's for the sake of not thinking about it for a while.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary election, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographics, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and the moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
The support among the men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the lead among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support her somewhat reserved and another 15% would support her just because she represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about first-ranked Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility are also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him running — though a third think he shouldn’t run.
When asked about the second option for the party representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the most likely candidate to win the general election; however, the numbers dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage by which he is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key characteristics compared to their party’s primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integral and reliable and have solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is trustworthy and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server while he was secretary of state, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject and say it hasn’t affected their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the email controversy did not affect their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their mind about Clinton in a negative way.
While Democratic voters see Clinton as integral and trustworthy, this issue continues to cause problems among voters at the general level: only 32 percent see her as integral and trustworthy, 8 percent less than last month and 15 percent less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be fair and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of national voters do not consider Trump to be complete and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush ranked first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, but, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the murder of a student in Year 1 of Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at New York’s Baruch College brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put a 14-kg backpack full of sand on his back, and repeatedly scuttled as he tried to make his way to a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim he would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found time to change Deng’s clothes, search for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s president at the national level, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunk and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year due to rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury has recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with outrage and complicity in the murder.
“We want to hold not only the people involved to account, but if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rate.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (the rising market) will subside, bond profitability will rise and the economy will enter recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers little indication of the time frame.
After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise, but on the path of time needed for normalization.
Indeed, in the game there are multiple variables.
However, in the end, market players might find that all the agitation related to the increase in the interest rate has been exaggerated.
“The first rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has been facing in recent months, anticipating an increase in the interest rate can volatile things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may again reflect the lag in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed’s growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards the increase in the interest rate Management, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return according to the last six public analysis, in the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and benefits are starting to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic low point for an increase in the Fed’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “whether this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a growth decision by the Fed, all eyes on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which closes on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, futures transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all the interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsed the pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of the recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, bond yields drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will approximate the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, though “we’re still cautious about forcing profitability,” Kathy Jones, a Schwab fixed-income analyst, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
“Besides the strength of the dollar and the estimated fall in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is more straight, the spread of the average loan interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased – all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do their majority business in the U.S. will gain from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial rise in the interest rate,” Goldman Sachs said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues as well as stocks with low volatility also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman said.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save could also have a win, though experts don’t agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being “stupid”
It claims to be increasingly similar to the commercial opponent.
He also won the BBC Music Awards, claiming to have plagiarized the Brits awards.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that it is doing something that commercial outlets are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station is "stupid" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 is ‘stupid’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I have the impression that it is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also won the BBC Music Awards, which were launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what’s already out there on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general has denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about the classical music I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important that Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new tracks is also important,” he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to attract the audience compared to the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC banner criticized at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Commission because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for about <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury – be performed “in a BBC-specific manner.”
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find the golden-egg chicken in its own enclosure” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he has refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or spend money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, it was the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could cause reluctance to spend.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating a growth of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the growth rate of previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,” IMRG sales index editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers began using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so in various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it’s stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers huddled in front of computers to get their hands on deals, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers fought on the bargains, could determine the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to go to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Bin Laden family is sanctioned, Muslims bury the victims killed in the fall of the Meccan crane
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were taken to the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the collapse of the crane
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned the dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead man reached the end of his final journey, at Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also killed 394 wounded.
In the ceremony held on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, who were killed because of a collapsed crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not provide the details, but said the company’s leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the Grand Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the collapse of the crane and the Group’s representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
Al Qaeda’s last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegade” son, disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the victims will receive one million Saudi Rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
The injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Converting Credits to Swiss Francs
In the banking market, two offers for the conversion of loans into Swiss francs have already appeared, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.
The Bank of Transylvania has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced a conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data accumulated by analysts of FinZoom financial portal, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest at RON, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Transilvania Bank’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with franc credits due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk and management fees paid by the customer, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly in RON before the conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduced the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Beneficiaries
The main advantage of the RON credit coverage in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases in the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which they collect their salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of the property, no additional guarantees are required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no further financial and legal analysis of the loan, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before the conversion, equivalent in RON.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the customer refunds very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems to be advantageous for customers.
However, it is not known how this interest will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in RON with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, to over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer, may also occur.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world looks forward to the two-day meeting, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week believed that the decision will be taken, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be maintained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been going through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001, she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 lost her lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the field for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a right-footed double fracture in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended in a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the pitch for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came after a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, aged 20, broke PSV's defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, he faces difficulties, then he plays fantastic and now it's happening.
His oxygen mask was put in the locker room.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it’s fault and red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account read: “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I’m starting the road to recovery, I’ll come back stronger.”

The England team’s founder has an extra reason to recover to play in the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very ugly injury.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never seek to hurt an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I only managed to see the ball, which was going in a different direction, so it seemed [Moreno] touched it but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through something like this.
I feel stupid, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England’s omission but still holds strong
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, they do not take into account a repeat of the defeat with 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't even eliminate the possibility of a victory on the go.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than they did three years ago, but he has good players on the line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a young positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the testing level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth has left the England team for the Test matches and has been replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach in Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven Test matches against two good strikers under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged by the results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I’ve said that before – the players are their own selectors.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance was not in line with his ability and I am not surprised by this; first of all, he is a team man.
It’s hard to answer the question of how long a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had good luck at home and on the move.
The only disappointment you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman whom I rate very well.
He’s a cricketer who has “factor X” and who we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open the baton alongside Cook, which would lead to an extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proven he's fucked up.
Moeen may not have been successful in his district of Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as a first drop before going open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age at a young age – with an average of 31 on the bat and 35 on the ball – and he might think it’s a point, but there’s not a lot of spinners and the selectors opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made a few changes to the coaching team.
Appointing Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unshakable ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the day’s matches, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not do the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The Brexit camp could have a win-win situation if the economy remains calm until 2017
As the day passes, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting increasingly confused, even without the choice of genius Jeremy “Yes or No?” Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat has explained in recent days that - plunged into crises similar to those in the EU - not all of which are internally provoked - some member states are fed up with the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they do not want this either if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK with an outside perspective under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that more obtuse ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but she has been in the lead for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation is shaken, as happened with Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been staying too long.
In 2017, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “the UK has not obtained anything of value from the renegotiation.”
Europeans know on their skin how catchy Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons are about the EU with skepticism, as they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry from 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-exempt thugs, foreigners who cheated over the phone, and pseudo non-domes who own most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a ticket out.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me gently on my back Monday in Westminster - I told him not to waste any more time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of Neil Kinnock's 1980s boycott of the egg, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC he left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would call indulgence evolution.
He says he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the “anglicism” of the Conservatives might agree with that.
That’s what Hilary told Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to acknowledge that Corbyn’s appointment of John McDonnell as “shadow minister” on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his fellow Labourers, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians at Monday night's private meeting.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he made me aware too - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s fair not to give Cameron a favour ticket to Europe, allowing him to take the Labour Party’s support in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophistry about EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissenters for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism – Tom Watson is unyielding that the JC will not campaign for resignation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters – on concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Public Health Department of England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of the evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinary fragile base” on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their foundation “on solid ground or on moving sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expected PHE’s claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that it would have received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them there are a few known "frontiers" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control department of the PHE.
The group's research work "convincedly masquerades" the lack of "firm evidence of the harmful effect most products have on most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded to the BMJ’s claims in the past.
He said: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives lose their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the risk of e-cigarettes to health is lower in comparison, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is and is not collected from the evidence, given in particular the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
An estimated 80,000 people die each year as a result of a smoking-related illness and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
By making clear the current evidence - that although the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they only represent a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Advertising that shames the arms trade of the United Kingdom
Watch the Amnesty International film against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing the ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause horrendous pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a hoot, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities’ desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and in subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?” says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will raid DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound Allen key package that states it "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet."
The London Transport Authority is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets the navigators who travel by subway.
The film, made by Amnesty International, had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the pro bono advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and voice-dubbing artist also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the gun fair ad — with an empty space in the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement, but "enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more striking".
“They’ve done a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty’s senior vice president.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms fair comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the U.S. Army regarding the "AT4CS RS with shoulder support launcher."
This includes “a uniquely shaped focus that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but I can barely remember the forced smiles of those I angered — and the numerous complaints about others.
Most of the things I’ve learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to dread.
The chatter is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you have spent a year off from school, what you think of Corbyn and why “sincerely, you are indifferent to Marmite because, on the good guys, it’s nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show yourself interested.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn’t even talk to if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
The bedrooms often abound with parties with drinks, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try on their underwear.

Introverts get special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes you build a sleeping culture based on friendship, socialization, and lifelong friends.

Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to remain friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy that I have consumed interacting with you.”

Home-cooked treats are a great way to make friends.

Don’t make noise that won’t let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it makes sense, but because you're going on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to slow down the music because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make the music louder.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, right "weird", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a repertoire that can make a symphonic sound without having it.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being unmissable.
Both performances, held on the stage of Athens, showed the audience a different way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they are talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They think they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
So we’re not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the side, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to look, which is stupid again,” said Grimal.
The violinist tells that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I found no point in continuing on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
“How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?” the artist asks.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the ensemble’s existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a foothold in the musical act: “In a curious way, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role”, says Grimal, adding that the stage is “in the audience”.
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present and sing 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and an interest in something different that breaks down barriers.
Speaking about Enescu’s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal campaigned for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the work of a musician, as it is organized today, has a death knell" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it's of no use.
In Bach's time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music, the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the tomatoes maybe not too pretty, but when we cut them they are the real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we considered - as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we would reintroduce his learning to school, we would reintroduce concerts to television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician with a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in one way, if we want to form a musician, it is completely different.
In your opinion, which is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist, smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert smiles".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the Festival of Ideas, a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile of David Grimal
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, the period in which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who switched to the course.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which he has regularly given concerts in the last 20 years on the main stages of classical music of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchestre National de Lyon, Chamber Orchester and Philharmonic Europe.
He has been the recipient of dedicated works by several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Fredilla Harrowing, Anders Verborg Oscar, Anders
In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal kept exploring more personal projects.
The freedom offered by her collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed her to develop her inner universe by venturing into repertoires not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Opera in Dijon.
He teaches violin courses at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many masterclasses and was a member of the jury of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres award from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year’s George Enescu International Festival together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, with Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven on the programme.
Les Dissonances also took to the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: the doubling of two characters from the super-production "Snowflake 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on the proximity of the actor's voice to the specifics of the animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City will organize a pre-selection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio together with professionals.
All parents need to do is to access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where they can register their child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Afterwards, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will record himself playing his own version of the dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the trial: "Yellow Pens 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the familiar 3D" and "Albinu<0xC8><0x9B>a Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double one character from the super-production "The Snow Queen - 3D Snowflake", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, lower tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing its year-round profit estimates as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday’s opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted a figure of $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher over-taxes for ground transportation of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to rise from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: "The firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade."
The holiday plans were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profits increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who took part in Zacks’ survey estimated the amount at $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted the FedEx Ground division’s bottom line.
In the last quarter, the revenue of the ground division increased by 29%, but operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while the revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday’s closing had fallen 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-legged Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the meeting hall of the central bank, will be seen a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s president, and his colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: to maximize the employment rate of the U.S. labor force and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is prepared to be dealt with by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect from the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data indicates a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials into adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate on federal funds — even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were to look for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed’s decision, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers softened the blow by promising that it would take a long time until the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise the interest rate at this point,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision makers do this, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.”
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward slowly tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to rise this year despite high objections from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labor market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Salary gains have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, the Fed’s decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the labor market tension,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began fibrillating at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16 percent below the record high in May, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drive down global growth.
The market has shrunk somewhat this month, with the Dow now hovering around 10% below its May high.
For Fed decision makers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate rise.
“Without what’s happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and there is almost no data to be based on later events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account when making decisions.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The simple allusion of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might “narrow” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly crowded, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that “the Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the rise in the interest rate, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications of limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned to those declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee.
The latest agitated period does not rise far to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into a situation where we’re afraid of rising interest rates because markets are angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to broadcast on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in audience for Today.
Nine's morning show aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The rival show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This “crusade” of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the numbers were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise an average audience of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to cope with a show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night's hearing answered resoundingly yes.
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, easily taking on the shows The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night he aired The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623,000 viewers – enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire’s show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia’s second-night audience will offer Nine’s tacit confidence that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at crowds demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after which they fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes that erupted on August 10.
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, policemen and weapons
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday’s Government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police with weapons.
“It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s,” Ponta said.
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC Announces 60% Probability of Cyclone South of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-reducing surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-reduction surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow nonsurgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the sleeve — in medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
Average BMI in people who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical treatments for diabetes remained almost at the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of the subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control”—reflected by improved A1c hemoglobin levels—did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the sleeve, the group with complete bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% versus 2.1%), and the group with complete bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg).
Although the new study does not indicate a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to urge people to take this aspect seriously,” she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent U.S. response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Toxic Center, U.S. anti-poison centers have reported an approximately 400% increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Toxic Center, cases of hand washing in children under the age of 12 reported to anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of these reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teens drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the perfumed ones.
Hand cleaners with strawberry, grape, orange flavor are the most attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah sneezed and couldn’t walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head over alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to him.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or wet wipes and not to leave the detergent in the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing an undeclared, toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders from northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in his classroom.
Police said the plan was "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

Hearts facing SFA over Neilson and Warburton's allegations is cautious about January acquisitions that have affected the team's unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half brought the Aberdeens a tight win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, with Dons scoring a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dispels rumours of misunderstandings
There have been rumours of misunderstandings at Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who has insisted that he and his team not be subject to increased pressure as they prepare to face the Dutch league leaders.
“I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scots in the race for the title bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands I don't give a summary of Celtic's matches; why?"
Because there's no Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
We're talking about the Old Firm.
We talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest is headed.
The pressure is high in Old Firm matches and it’s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic are fighting back but the Norwegian boss has promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: “Celtic have had periods before and will recover.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We absolutely need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's prudence on January transfers
Despite comments last week that suggested he had identified some targets for January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former Brentford boss said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer transfer period.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that aren’t needed.
Celtic to target Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic at the time of the transfer, suggested he might retire at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the red card of the slingshot was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was picked up after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I don't have to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United still have confidence that the management team will change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for 'dirty victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to the Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to the penalty kick in the first overtime run by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won something, in a cup or league, and that has not won matches like this.”
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of unemployed in the UK overall increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of employees currently at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% – a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said: “The authorities’ long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm going to sit in an observer's room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary Execution Room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws to a close, I am horrified by the idea.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It’s true, journalists can witness executions in America and, because the demands usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will look at execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I’d sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I’ve developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated it better,” but he still thinks they’re wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don’t tell me what to write and I wouldn’t do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be present to write on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I won't go back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will find out what it is like to look at a man who likes dying unnecessarily.
Peter Moody claims Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatens to retire from racing
Peter Moody said that the Stewarts had tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from the races.
He launched an attack on the Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing industry and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed up his words about the spy statements and did not want to look like “the fox that doesn’t get to the grapes”.
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that and I’ve been silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly goes away,” Moody said.
It is known that he continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to offer them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, they have to give up their coaching job.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Moody had earlier dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man — whose name I’ll tell him if I’m asked — and they offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Ra.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can hold people outside of the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe I need to take my license and set myself aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now could cause them to think about this variant.
But I’ve come to the point where I don’t care anymore, and that saddens me.
I'm very sad.
I will put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration grew with the long-running cobalt testing investigation involving Lidari, and the elimination prompted him to say he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' feet, which violates the rules.
He's breaking the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which is what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on race day consisting of applying cataplasm, for which the Stewarts opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that there is a need for rules, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran away from the scene of the accident in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be charged with running from the scene of the accident, failing to provide first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm head coach Craig Bellamy is responding to opponents in the wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the plating tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" brought up by the top two favourites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "take over" the team in Storm's nervous win in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
The coach of the Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to the Queen after the victory of his team in the qualifying match with the North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two were not pre-empted.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the plating tactics approached by his team and stated that players simply focused on “contact” when they were plating.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
“And things don’t stop here — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us with a score of 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year long, so much so that in the last six weeks we’ve really put the emphasis on contact in the pitches and so we’ve changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it’s probably not usual to lose and it was a shock to him.
We always enjoy what happens at this time of the year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea to "animate football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarra that Bennett's Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing football "tough".
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he wasn’t as interested in black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we thought was exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his playing style - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they claim these things because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they thought about the big games.
Bellamy also highlighted the fact that the game between Storm and Roosters was a more bitter score-related contest compared to the game between the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take a break and not to mark?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the final of next Saturday’s preliminaries at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to “attract pedophiles” to the Internet before “claiming he’s a cop to scare them off.”
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about the fact that he had asked the person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to seduce her.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused was using the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making or taking indecent photos of children, and breached conditional release conditions on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court on January 24.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be registered in the sex offenders’ register because it can be said that this crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentence until October for social reasons.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody prior to appearances for other cases.
He was placed in the sex offenders' register before his sentencing.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but filming the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to in any way harass Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was ejected during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
They warn the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The leader of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats posed to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 deployments
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 deployments as part of the company’s restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the service sector.
This year, HP will split the stock market into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services that are booming.
The planned deployments will cost about $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently and will hold a broad business portfolio that will help companies transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and “focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is splitting up, having as its object the production of electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called the "Silicon Valley swing".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking over the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to challenge the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality it is isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – which further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments they watch football in comfortable armchairs, and Ross’ passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can relate to this situation, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who call on us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms of psychological adaptation in the long run.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, outside intervention helps, through the phone, people reached in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you’re attending this weekend’s FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with the full play of the set to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG take Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut match and helped PSG impose themselves on Sweden's Malmo.
Below we present to you the history of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, with Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League series with a reassuring 2-0 win against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to an advantage although they missed a number of times before securing their lead with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Coming into Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team’s goal is not only to qualify for the best but also to improve their way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering the opportunity of a goal after which he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the road in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next standings, even if there are still aspects that we need to improve throughout the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we couldn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic came back after injury to one of three changes to the team in Paris, with a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in League 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he snarled at Marco Verratti’s waist behind Malmo’s defense before shooting incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long right corner.
But if anyone expected PSG to get the win by squeezing their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders in national teams, with a defense of five men and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of the shot of Nikola Djurdjic who passed the post of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, taking a few unnecessary steps and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, his concern being the one Di Maria sent in a shot deflected by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in the final after an hour of the match was lost, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed away from Maxwell's center.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope of rebalancing the score, and only a superb stop by Wiland from a distance for David Luiz's rejection kept the final score before new infielder Ezequiel Lavezzi was called off a goal in overtime.
Age Hareide, the team’s head coach from Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, later said that PSG were one class over and that “the last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year.”
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore to raise $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity exchange, has amassed $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is grappling with falling commodity prices because China’s declining economic activity is influencing demand and causing disaster in markets.
The preferential right to subscribe raised the price of Glencore’s shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed a $2.5 billion share sale as part of a broader plan to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, down 2.4% from Tuesday’s closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about China’s protracted stagnating economy have led to a substantial rise in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy must open up more broadly to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies,” Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform (CGE).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
According to the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimizing requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
The unions in education, dissatisfied with the government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions have not reached any results, the government has proposed a 10% wage increase from December 1, with payment on January 1, 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of the Government today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been able to convene the leaderships of our federations.
The 10 percent that we have been promised today is less than we expected.
"In fact, this 10 percent is the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which representatives of the Government will participate to present to the representatives of the confederations in the country the proposal of salary increase, following the trade unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Wages Act to Parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase foreseen in the document to be made in the next four years.
Victor Ponta has also promised trade unionists the full payment of the court sentences in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey’s territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat in which they were stranded sank.
Among the victims were 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The ship was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coastguard said it had managed to rescue 249 people in the wrecked boat, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has recently become a popular one for immigrants who want to escape the war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 Stewardesses Fired for Being Too Fat
The airline Air India is firing about 130 stewardesses and stewardesses because they are overweight, the company announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist."
The mass concession is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the busiest stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine stewardesses deemed "exceptionally overweight", as this "may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility required to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them lose weight have failed,” a company spokesman said in a statement.
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion’s financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Paul Papp Academy will operate in the town of Dej, with deserts in the town waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about training material.
They need to have only one concern: that of playing football as well as possible.
Technical details do not have to be their concern.
They need to put their talent to good use.
This is what the Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them," football player Papp told dejeanul.ro.
Children under the age of 11 are expected to attend the Star Fund Academy.
The party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the entire party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize by a decision of Congress, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone insecurity to the government or give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the PSD Permanent National Bureau.
PSD announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, give a clear message if it wants to continue the government or if the party decides to pass in opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce Monday if I will run for a position in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the future Congress.
I will sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is established.
"I will announce whether I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about announcing the candidacy had anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I do not have the problem you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy at the moment when the date of the Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed the extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at the Customs Exchange with immigrants hidden in the TIR
Two Sri Lankans were found on Monday at the Bors customs office while trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of a truck driven by an Italian citizen.
As a result of the research, it was established that the two paid the driver with 4,000 euros to be transported to France, informs the Border Police.
At the specific checkpoint, the border police noticed in the truck’s cabin a large travel bag, in which there were personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a detailed control over the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic crates, two men.
From the verifications it has resulted that the persons in question, two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
“At the research, the young people stated that they intended to arrive in France, for which they contacted a co-national, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to the destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person,” the statement said.
The two migrants were given “criminal proceedings in the aspect of the commission of the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border”.
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum brand car, registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, following which he was presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are the Romanians in a couple: Men versus women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were ‘very satisfied’ and ‘satisfied’ with the overall quality of the couple’s relationship.
"However, 18% appear to be 'unsatisfied' and 'very unsatisfied' in the couple's relationship, and another 18% declare 'suitable'," the study concluded.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral (correct) state, we see a difference of two percent.
"Similarly, in a very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the company said in a statement.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also report that "Romans feel the need for something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, important 14%, free control 12%, self-control".

What's Happening With Coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career as she has to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician being with the romance only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the capricious sportswoman.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep will have to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or give up on collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore, I will be able to give an answer," Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, demanding a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Singapore Champions Tournament.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania’s national team last fall.
The former selector confessed that he did not get along with FRF president Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
In the end, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but was refused.
At this point, I'm not sorry that I left the national team.
Then I felt sorry, we left a job behind.
I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work is not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas.
But I wanted to leave.
If he really wanted to stay, I offered him a bigger contract.
We have about 400 and something thousands of euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Blinds and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police have deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia, following violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary’s gharpaim raising.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were injured after they were thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect the security of Hungary by any means," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
Police tried to control with tear gas and water cannons the crowd of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of flooring.
Authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to penetrate the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants from the shared border.
There are reports that the Serbs have supplemented their forces at the border.
Following the incidents on Wednesday, Budapest suspended the border crossing from Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders in order to stave off access to migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that in addition to the wire fence on the border with Serbia will raise one on the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the lifting of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease that a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was drunk, could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he did not drink alcohol, he was clearly drunk.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he told Mirror.
When he saw his wife’s videos with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn’t recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
“It was terrible, I don’t remember anything.”
In addition, his wife, who, although he hesitated for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that got Nick thinking was when, after a minor accident, he had been hit by another car, it turned out that he had an alcoholism three times over the legal lime, although one night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, the body makes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease has no cure yet, but since giving up carbohydrates, Nick has never had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cart
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cart, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, reports BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video reached the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had malfunctions that put his life and his family at risk.
Its occurrence occurred when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem, as he had agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018" and the "Agency Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernize the process of immigration management on the national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and the direction of action that reflects the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures for the unitary and coherent management of situations caused by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of crisis of a political, social, economic or military nature are considered.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with migration potential or that may affect national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the neighbouring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promotion of legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access on the territory of Romania of third-country nationals who meet the needs of employment, promoting access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers it to be “a means of establishing concrete activities that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon”.
Romania, in a European top regarding the labor market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in the total cost of labour among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to the expenditure on the staff of the employers.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labor rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU in rising labour costs
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly cost of labour fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of labor.
The activity report of the TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Culture Committees of the Parliament on Wednesday rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
The report was rejected by 17 MPs, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Permanent Bureau meeting.
They will decide, probably next week.
At the next plenary meeting it will be discussed.
"I think that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the president of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, provided that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It made sense to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members last night, with about an hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the offices, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that at the time you are called, you are a budget employee, paid from public fees, and you are called to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you do not like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that during the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw and how they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I will remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's fault that the agreement with the banks and the tax has been lost, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the plenary meeting there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the general director of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, in the plenary of Parliament, by their vote, to choose with much reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities it should have - I feel good in the attitude towards employees because it is a curse of petitions that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you get 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we’re talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” he said.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR’s President and CEO, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of your public television, among them the TV-indexes.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public service of television, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes to date, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on control in the field of payment of the TV fee and the detection of contraventions and the application of penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become representatives of the SRTv for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on revenues.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of law 41/1994, in order to receive budget/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural events, World Cup and World Cup.
He argues that SRTv will become incapacitated in the coming months, given that the labor legislation obliges the employer to implement the judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and salary rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," the letter said.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by one’s own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission," the letter said.
The Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, sent to court
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damage of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL with his mother in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, in order to exempt from payment of taxes and duties to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police said in a press release.
The Six Determined Sanmartean's Fate
Al-Ittihad's six-year-olds have decided the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, the impresario of coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen anymore.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays title match match and does it well.
The Sixers also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come to fruition," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu has been voted Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament voted on Wednesday the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were recorded.
The vote was secret, with ballot papers.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, reports Digi24.
Moreover, the liberals have criticized Sarbu's appointment to this position and announced that they will challenge it to the CCR, provided that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position of the Court of Accounts does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which was left free after Ioan Anton was dismissed, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper takes on the role of a chef in the film Burnt, the actor made a revelation his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I’ve worked most of my life as a chef.”
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, then in college, to continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the entire childhood he cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
When asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
“I have dreams, things that you would laugh about if I told you,” he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking the role of Clint Eastwood, who took over directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slanders and irrational statements
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday morning condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims that Hungary's political decision-makers are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, he offends the whole of Hungary," Hungary's foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians don’t say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in Romania's domestic politics," the head of Hungarian diplomacy added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges posed by Hungarian government representatives.
"These are a disgrace to the European Union's culture and values; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" she wrote on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is committed to rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, noting that the brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Imprisoned serfdom, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these goals and values!" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s remarks on Hungary’s handling of the refugee crisis “simple lies,” saying those statements were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and say is that I am against xenophobic speeches, the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are the fools of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them with bata and insert.
"I don't agree with that," the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to start preparations on the ground for the expansion of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence did not solve anything of the refugee problem and "bring Hungary out of Europe".
What is the relationship between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Meccan crane?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, an accident that left 107 people dead.
According to an investigation commission, the company did not "respect safety rules," the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former al-Qaida terrorist network leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Grand Mosque in order to host more pilgrims.
The crash occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, crashed on the eastern side of the Grand Mosque roof in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the mouths of the protestors
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after retiring from the activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he sponsors.
A year after taking over the team, the King has shown he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from retrograde into one of the tops.
Thus, after a year, the future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance is one of a top team, which beats the European cups.
Things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team finished second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (on par with Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even if it brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made the future a team to watch for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Together with Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Large countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the steering committee of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the purely political means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we cannot go back in history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt to and adapt to.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC President, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the forecasts said they would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it’s a sensitive issue, there have been backlashes in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy, and they didn’t want it to appear in many countries as a “EU sends us migrants on their heads” reaction.
They have therefore delayed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but the subject has just been left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from individual responsibility of members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle that migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is falling, you can’t say endlessly that it’s Greece’s business.
problem and common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I do not believe that European states will take on migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely to reach some unique filtering centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem has no simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year at a wave maybe even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it so catastrophically in the media.
Talk about countries with more or less experience.
Do you think that there is a place where the integration of large groups from a non-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but this does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, and the UK.
But pure means cops won't work.
Let us create a strong and illusory Europe.
We need to move towards integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more assertive.
To ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration it does not mean that we have to look at them drowning in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see strength within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we move around freely, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it can not be so, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run not much changes.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under the pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
“Schengen is now like an animal that was created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, which believes that if it pulls the sack over its eyes and squeezes its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your problem of the small country.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated like a seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says it may be good that we haven't entered yet.
So we move from despairing entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will enter Schengen for migrants to see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two foci, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
A few years ago there was a struggle between the Assad regime and secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf countries and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate matters, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you're only powerful if you have solutions.
Off-side play is just a strategy to gain time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, to push the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another the issues created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin any stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, that of "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it was not very comfortable for people to give “Like” to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable giving Like to those posts,” the Facebook representative said.
The new Facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
"There's already enough hate on Facebook and social media," Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times' Facebook page, where the article on the topic was posted.
"I'm going to give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it was hard to imagine that a single button could transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the “Dislike” button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of people en masse on its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main point of the border crossing and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania.
The measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they will seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council is falling.
Two construction companies are insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are about to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The seat of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will come to collapse on its own.
A year and a half after the completion of the consolidation and re-consolidation works of the building, the works did not reach even half.
A final stage in the building’s era was consummated last days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The initial project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the bankruptcy of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company will update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works will be organized.
"The negotiations did not end with a contract, however, with CJ assessing that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timoficuc, who represented public relations at CJ.
The CJ’s decision to discontinue direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which dismissed it as too late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the decision of the CNSC at the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it can be considered finding another designer.
Thus, the work to strengthen the building could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timoficuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Headquarters began in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works for the consolidation, refurbishment and attication of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I say it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case from the Cadastre Office signed an agreement for the recognition of the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, headed by the former head, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a corruption case has acknowledged his fap tele.
The agreement on the recognition of facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Court of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was charged with intellectual fraud in continuous form and agreed to serve two years in a cesarean section, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts imputed to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors stated that he, as the advisor of the Cadastre Office, was not able to perform these services, together with other colleagues, "falsely drew up several minutes of acceptance, when selling the contracts for the provision of services in the previous keys by O.C.P.I.
In recent days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of OCPI, have been sued in this case, the accusations being the settlement of services to the mentioned companies, although the works have not been carried out.
Before the trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of the President of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women’s national handball team for qualifying for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this you have to go through two stages of caudin forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masori, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a head of delegation.
They asked us for things to qualify, more specifically materials for physical training, that we had never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with the preparation.
“The teams we’re fighting with have these materials and they’ve had them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to be called into question by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic districts were built entirely in a two-year period.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beauty landmark.
The same thing happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people agreed in principle, but it became clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want to, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
“So we have all the openness, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in forecasts, that if they do not meet they turn against them."
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players make their debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said in a press conference on Tuesday that all the components of the Romanian lot are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to achieve two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We have trained to give the best performance in all four matches.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
“If we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I want to not disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with nice results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family such as rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
The national team of Romania, Lynn Howells, who was at the first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
For me it is an extraordinary experience.
For me it is very important that in every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These guys started playing in Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to make a dream come true," Dumitras said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will advance to Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.

14 million lei given to the Hospital "St. Spiridon" in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i at the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
St. Spiridon Hospital received from the Ministry of Health, as a result of the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use them by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and arrangement of some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six appropriately equipped ATI beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other devices necessary for the development of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Great Fire".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the next few days we will be hosting the work from the walkway linking UPU with cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the patient from UPU to neighboring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Clinic of Dermatology in T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where there is allergology, hematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.

A tourist's pet
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to step foot in your city again.
Unwillingly, they were struck by the erroneous information in the leaflets, by the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "so says the law".
The spouses arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited Ia<0xC8><0x99>u.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because there was no ton of tickets in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS according to the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers made their appearance.
They said there was no service for two years and that it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, I coming one evening before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they don't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they can do is give us one fine instead of two (my wife and me).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day to visit the stand at the gendarmerie and give statements there!", Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerating by many, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Woe to the violators of the Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven violators from Vaslui has moved, since yesterday, to the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
The magistrates tried the first term of the trial in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the trial, one of the judges from the country to whom the case was assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made an application for abstinence, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate was active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Section on Trials, he was the one who, on April 9, admitted a complaint made by four of the defendants, ordering their detention at home.
The case is currently being tried by a panel of judges including Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, the judge Dan An ton formulated a abstention, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubine relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the violators of Vaslui should remain in preventive detention.
The blacks will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when judges will re-examine the possibility of their release.
The next hearing will take place at the Iasi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal, the van carrying the violators from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari neighborhood, the car entering Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the belt.
The Iveco car carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car that had come off Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The duba circulates from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>curari.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i around here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on to Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport, to take over the prisoners.
Soon, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Maximum Security Prison, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the masonry, and the arrests came out at speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the cars were amicably understood about the damages that must be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin Tsaranu, within the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the Romanian state’s ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves powerless in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of all colors have not been able to absorb European funds, to make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, to provide decent healthcare, to collect garbage from the street, to create decently paid jobs or to preserve their own generation.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent plight of the EU’s powerful states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Maybe he's afraid of being robbed by some national entity.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they invoke only the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept any destination of the exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken in derision.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even some foreign capital enters from time to time into the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anachronistic construction, disbanded and overrun by the situation.
I was complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have any future plan.
And improvisations and threats don't help.
Then, to what use does the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and never will be ready for what will come next.
7,000 euros per year to rent the Club Pogor.
The destination, practically, imposed
The tendering procedure shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the court of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful area of 134 square meters, on two levels of ridges.
CJ accepts as a given destination only those of the literary cafe, bookstore or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,300, the starting value of the auction being <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,830 per year, with an offer step of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be prepared.
"The Club Pogor building is in advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public feeding unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance works were carried out as they are currently required during the operation of a building," the document states.
The club's concession bids are expected to run until September 18.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-old children, respectively 11-year-old brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother followed a treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were rushed to St. Mary's Hospital in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the black of the 90s, when he had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family from Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young gypsy, now a young girl with no blond and no fruit.
Crina will be 20 years old these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to give their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, to know their unclear past.
"The Diary of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i", who assisted in the search efforts of the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporters’ reporting, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, to the city.
At home, there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and the mother was forced to leave the house.
He decided to keep the girl and send me out of the house.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still then the girl's father, Kostica Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives were to be separated forever.
They never found Crina in the hospital again.
After internment, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and her father, when he returned, could not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She thought she was abandoned," says one of the family's granddaughters.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child in all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, who then put her in the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more lightly regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with blonde Crina on the spot, and after a while she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The baby had already been in the womb for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities had lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“As if my wife had given him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us with a smile, as he grasps the girl’s squeaky hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their separate searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child could be.
The police then informed them that she may have died, but at Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me in court that she had gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for it I no longer had.
We prayed to God to be well.
I've been thinking about her all these years, but there were no opportunities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," the biological mother of Crina tells us with tears in her eyes.
However, even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to get to know my parents in Romania,” says delighted Crina.
And her dream was about to become a reality.
In March of this year, Roma chief commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Advising Antidrug Iasi, was contacted by a acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search started with only one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only got one name, the Costican Balcan, then the town, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there is by the locality the name received.
Then they gave me a few clues, only that the person found was not the one they were looking for.
“It took us about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” Ichim said.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since each had a home in another locality.
We started the steps somewhere in March, and in the months of June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided to have a first meeting in September," Ichim added.
In the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica saw for the first time the girl lost in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
Just change a few words with the people around you.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a granddaughter, who also came with Costume from Ruginoasa.
Crina's meeting with her biological mother and brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Kostica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, in the village, to come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and bury her.
Her mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly thinks that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think this could happen.
I’ve seen cases like this on TV, I’ve been thinking about it all these years, I’ve been hoping, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
There are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," Alina, Crine's mother, tells us with big tears on her cheeks, while holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
In it she hides her tears, happily, because soon she will see her face after such a bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days, is trying to calm down like an emotional child this month.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
After all, my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i
In the Unirii Square, under the sky at the beginning of autumn, the Ruginoasa family once again unites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishes high school, according to the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It no longer divides borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that this is the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It is the first event of its kind organized, of such an emotional charge, and I am glad to be a success.
We at the Center have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, people addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
"If I am ever asked for such an event, I will do it with great pleasure," says Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Advice Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling a story.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns on foot, yesterday, at PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The camps in the PSD’s Iesian branch have concluded a ceasefire with a weapon on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, carried from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party’s positions.
Far from being over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a pause to allow the fighters to shoot their souls.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain had been established.
In the October elections, for the position of president of the county branch of the PSD, fierce competition is expected.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office of the Iesian branch of the party are the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Laz<0xC4><0x83>r, the County Councillor Vasile C<0xC4><0x83>tea and the Interim President of the County Council, Victor Lupu.
The mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, may also be added to these.
A variant considered is also the candidacy of PSD county councillor leader Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party saying that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, nominations can be submitted, and no one would wonder if that would happen.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new leadership structures," C<0xC3><0xA2>tea said.
Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to a "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"However, on the other hand, there are several options regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of PSD Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the list remaining open," Stanciu said.
A judge has refused the case of the violators of Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
The Vaslui people sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the main court, the Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The case was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton making an application for abstinence, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton argued that one of the defendants’ lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate from the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In motivation, the judge speaks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among the public opinion.
"The court finds that after the moment of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of liberty but not a deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, there was felt at the level of the local and national community a strong feeling of indignation against the fact that the defendants were indignant.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who, during the trial, argued that the girl they raped was not a “church door.”
“The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they have formulated, since a person’s physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext,” the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue in the following years.
By Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the Labour Party in the UK, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the war.
A declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (at one point, NATO asked Tony Blair, the then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today", and the "Miracles of the United States").
For Corbyn, who at the time viewed the killing of Osama bin Laden as a true tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States’ favorite.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the ones Tsipras said and promised in Greece until the moment he broke with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic program of the new Labour leader envisages, among other things, massive renationalisations and printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some may wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimously adopted in the world, we would then have a global prosperity!, but who would prevent further such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers, become some kind of service enemies of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The extra sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, unencumbered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher once said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point other people’s money runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his convictions as the party’s fresh leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has meant that the industry needs massively high-skilled labor, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times considers that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, namely the UK’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that shakes the foundations of the EU, you end up with an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide in the wake of the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it by the Euro crisis and now refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin became increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country remaining in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the same as in the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, which we had just recently sampled in Jean-Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States, consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening in conditions where electoral support for anti-systemic, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher altitudes than ever before.
This is where the Financial Times comes in when it assesses the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region to the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fueling his populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both caused by rash decisions that only took into account the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the intense internal tensions in the EU will affect.
And it’s hard to rule out anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
They say, "Take the workshop and sweep it."
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him in the whole world.
But behind his fame is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called "trouble."
What to write about Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His picture appeared on the banknote.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i has been producing and delivering money for nearly 60 years since he was no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when she goes out with the adult, she hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i".
The country is strewn with statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works should be known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi’s infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the communists failed to remove it from Romania’s memory and culture.
His quotes span the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would be to say, to write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you haven't been lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family as well-off as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Perhaps this is where the next text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the silly success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, he heard a whole world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains.
She is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a family of well-to-do peasants, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which would pick up his landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, in Paris, in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For thousands of years, people lived, happily, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come to us.
But Brancusi’s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor years spent in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the "cauldron" was being made, watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going well, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with pacifiers and drinks on the non-breathing.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then goes into hysteria, believing her son has died.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the living room accompanied by beggars, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul at their mouth.
The party immediately turns into a pity party.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds that it is good to call Baba Br<0xC3><0xA2>ndu<0xC8><0x99>a, a baker and servant of the Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
The brandy checks the child's breathing, then puts under his nose a horse's hooves, gathered around.
Strong, sneezing baby.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to continue to sleep his drunkenness, for joy, the party with beggars continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i asks Constantine to collect some nuts and bring them to him.
The father places his child with his head down and, with the nubiles brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And, while feeling the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that the surrounding things can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from that of the well-known, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if somehow the astro participated in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At the moment, the city is not working.
A member of parliament calls on politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3> called on the PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that is all.
I haven’t seen anything from the 2012 USL projects to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside a little, let's get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the Iesean electorate, the consequence being a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
Also, the deputy believes that voters will always be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iasi" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break away from the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on active civic people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is crumbling even more, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD," said Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3>.
He said he is not interested in a candidacy for the upcoming local elections, dispelling rumors about his intention to enter the race for the City Hall.
I said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still thinking about whether to continue as a member in the next term.
I tried to call for unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to take my picture.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blajut, who said that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected ones.
A colleague from T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i said that his money was not enough and he had to take the bus.
Let us not be hypocritical.
It's not little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the cashier's money.
At the end of the term, I will report on everything I have spent, except the salaries of the cabinet employees and their maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the bills of transport, accommodation and others.
"To say that a parliamentarian does not get his money is pure hypocrisy," concluded Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3>.
