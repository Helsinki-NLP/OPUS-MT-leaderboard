Welsh MPs worry they will 'look like Muppet'
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) were shocked by the proposal that they could be called MPs of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentarians from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become the subject of a row.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name "rhymed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
The MP from the Party of Wales (Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to a name change, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee that is currently preparing the law to introduce the change of name announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will be titled will be on their own."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that found widespread support for changing the name of the House of Commons to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what will be called MPs in the House, the Committee has tended to be called "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
MPs are proposing alternative options, but a fight to reach a consensus could lead to a headache for House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a change bill within weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the council, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, the House of Representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the possession of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing as churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The older people I talked to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"There's no one else today."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People today are getting along in a different way,” he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay.”
When it comes to churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "sooner or later will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so the day will come when these churches will be completely closed down because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which was holding worship services nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson had planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin’s, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor people.”
An expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is taking place in St. Martin during the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which were brought by lay leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish made up of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "seek to shift costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark has been injured while diving for lobsters in California.
According to an official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s call for help, and then drove the group to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was excitement about the lobster being caught, but then he realized that he was screaming “Bite me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that as he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone was torn.
“I tried to get everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the bathers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic countertops in the style of department stores and hiring specialist retailers.
As part of a major <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market entry, which continues to grow alongside a decline in sales in the clothing and home equipment market, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to take advantage of the shelf space that was once provided for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its cosmetic product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing assortment of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will trial the concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to make more efforts to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles to resist bargains such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a number of Habitats departments, as it bought both chains two years ago, which it claims spurred the sale of groceries and made those acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed three years ago when Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million at 281 Celesiu store, which is owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in a special training of colleagues who will be at hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Dragon’s star Den Peter Jones has been left to “cook out of anger” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new deals with the Marks & Spencer chain of stores and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand name is compared to the Goop brand name of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of this morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones to cook from anger by retiring at the last minute from a lucrative joint venture to focus on her own brand new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a golden TV girl during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million mean she no longer has enough time to devote to their brand of home fashion.
The deal was compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to step down has stunned everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the start of the entire line.
At Marlow’s headquarters, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that due to the departure of the show's host This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes and possible additional line-up.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
It was a tough fight, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the newspaper over comments that some might consider "indecent to the president" and because he had such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not notice a "adequate response" from the US to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the U.S. has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
In his speech at the meeting, Trump took a much more optimistic stance.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results — stopping missile test launches, helping to free hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act like the president, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena to enter, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so all this is a bit of a problem,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
Given the constant shaking of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in case of a tsunami were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common on other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best of times, traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is in Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia’s decayed structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and next year new elections are being held.
Yoko is also facing pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge has scored a goal to equalise against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League match against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was at about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal with a 1-0 result for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left foot before kicking it to the opposite stand.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaya Arrizabalaga who jumped towards her and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just touched the ball once. I didn’t think about it too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea led with a 1-0 lead after hitting Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that match before turning around somewhere in the half of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick addition to the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and left footed shot the ball into the net on the opposite stand next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will host Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster office said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people had been reported trapped in the ruins of the building after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds to Grayson Mews on John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people from the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like to hear from everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived on the scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are also in the process of notifying the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were now told it would take several hours until they could return to their apartments.
The policeman reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 14:00 there were two police vans in the fenced area, and another one was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and supervised the housing block.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing Minutes 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of the debate on "the transcendence of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent revival of Cromwell's Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century way of thinking and part of the person's historiography that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than it is today, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully credible opinion is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honor and recognition."
A pig killer has killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man with only the name "Yuan" has been found dead from a severed artery and covered in blood near a stall at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, China's Morning Star newspaper reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos had bitten the breeder to death.
Evening news from Guiyang reported that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and maimed."
A security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig had attached a Welsh farmer to a tractor while his wife had not chased the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “switch.”
“They’re just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains over the next few days in the area of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h in eastern weather, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure area is created and moved toward the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northwards toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low-pressure area will cause heavy rainfall in much of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential floods, mudflats and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation of about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain as much as 25 to 100 mm in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local stormy winds and a dusty blizzard.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfalls of more than 12 mm are possible, which can cause less mudflats and slippery roads.
It will be the first downpour in the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical plumes will begin to approach Arizona on a late Sunday night and early Monday morning before covering a wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend Tuesday to the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central U.S.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the lagging summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., early October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched six television networks on Thursday to witness the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political reckoning continued, with reporters interrupting a regular program to notify a reversal at the last minute on Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a scathing testimony that he was absolutely certain it didn't happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, according to a Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better idea of that, it’s an audience that is similar in number to the one watching American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake had a pivotal role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning filmed him screaming at protesters as he tried to take the elevator to go to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes peeled as he was seen live on CNN cameras by protesters.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to this country?”
They said to him, "You have power, while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office issued a statement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were monitored live when the Justice Committee was supposed to vote on referring Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week, which were demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partially persuaded to talk to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then a few other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview in the same issue with her on the cover continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties was “complete nonsense”.
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a man suspected of murdering Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on the charge of manslaughter, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpsons, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said they had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A bail of $350,000 was requested.
The office of the coroner of the East Baton Rouge municipality on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The Police Department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for enforcing the law on "persistence and the search for truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 183-cm-high wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash at Mexico City
The ash ejecting the volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of the capital Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple pounding and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The clash between Catalan police and separatists marks the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with intervention police and after thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark Catalonia’s polarising vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists who had been prevented by the intervention police began shooting police officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting broke out later in the day when the police used sticks to calm the fighting.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and the Unionists chanted "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in the pro-independence region have not subsided for a year after the October 1 referendum declared by Madrid to be illegal, which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence although the turnout was small because those who opposed secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, albeit narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's independence parties are struggling to maintain momentum this year because their best-known leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their non-referendum role in organizing the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is becoming more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been jailed since the end of last year, announced that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
“Candidateing for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after a car hit the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7.30pm BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the front door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point a self-propelled gun was fired at the car.
Menge gave Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston was a win.
The new club of the Scottish Premiership League Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to acknowledge his only second defeat of the club's 18 games at Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team settled with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which they are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has meanwhile increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on chances against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they hit that shot, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole host of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was too slow on the way to the goal, after which Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head toward the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties for the guests.
And that's exactly how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free-kick, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisting Mengi who hit in the middle of the goal.
By this time, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but faced impenetrable domestic defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
This continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs were in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent a broad blow from another organized attack on Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two elevens were not awarded - after Halkett's clash with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand-playing.
"Great" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game and Livingston's score.
All up to one were excellent, which continued to exceed expectations on that entry route.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but a great credit goes to Holt and the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading a well-organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a breather throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They didn't manage to get the ball through to the end, they only opened a hole in the home team once, and that's a kind of call to tear themselves up for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leaders of the Turks and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
Turkey has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of presidential supporters came to see it nearby.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – including a large number of Kurds – have raised their voices by condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero, while others attack as an autocrat.
Deptford Road Crash: Bicyclist Killed in Car Collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a densely trafficked road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed after the crash and the driver fled from the site of the accident in Chiders Street, about a kilometer and a half from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The city police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus traffic was diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male-dominated prison.
Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" units were brought in to quell the unrest involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were provided with assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been hired to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received assistance due to the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they could spend longer behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, intervention police were called to prison to solve a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (potential benefit to drought areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the Desert Southwest with residual force and brings the danger of torrential flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the area of western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is due to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin there is a probability of precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from torrential floods, Rosa could come as a rescue as the region is hit by a drought.
Although floods are a great danger, part of these rainfalls could be useful because in the southwest there is currently a drought.
“According to the U.S. drought map, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category.”
The hurricane's journey first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, the coast of Mexico will be approached by the force of a tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“The total amount of precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to northwestern Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the U.S. Desert Southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential flooding and mudflows in deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
At around 4 a.m. BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said the 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officials have called for everyone who has a video of the incident to come forward.
Trump Claims Kavanaugh Suffered from the Anger and Anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s cruel and shameful tactics,” Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and fury" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanauh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charge she brought.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service,” he told cheering supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks divides us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
An aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them by the huge waves that hit the coast when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the coast at dusk, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run right away and were killed,” Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s agency for mitigating the consequences of the BNPB disaster, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two-fold strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communications are down and we don't have any information from Donggal."
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers have been deployed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Pal, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of a building is panickingly warning people down the street about an upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to officials, the army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city's airport is only open for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
A tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although the staff of World Vision from Donggale successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were housed in inter-aulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed the scenes of destruction along the way,” Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have set up relief wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from arriving in Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can get international aid, but that’s not yet declared.”
When the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, the friends and families of those who still consider themselves missing were still hoping their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
“Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, which had spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who took part in the festival on the beach.
But his messages were still marked with a grey checkerboard instead of two blue checkers.
“I think that means that the messages are not delivered,” he said.
The thieves took away 26,750 US dollars during the filling of ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole US$26,750 from Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, another man “came to Brink’s employee behind the back in the race” and stole a bag of money to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "The living being will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled due to "emotional reasons."
In addition to being a shorthand for his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in an interview with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s you, it’s me, it’s us.
It started from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye alone – it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is really a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, JAY-Z, played with versions of his name without a dash and with a dash and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO says it won't use military force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed he will never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as the leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education attract young criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research in that area,” said AI investor and AI expert Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy in principle.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
“A double budget increase for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
"A double increase in investment could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will come in the U.S.," Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American game player, Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that leads academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that doctoral students in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
The State Council of China announced the next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations provide financial resources to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners from the business and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has lasted for several decades and for which Greece blocked the opening of accession negotiations with the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the appropriation of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
A question on the referendum ballot read: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, it's our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, joined a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining the NATO alliance and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and moved chairs in front of a tent set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the great majority will support the referendum, since more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “positive” result would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required response.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, to take the win to Manchester City with a score of 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory insanely simple, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three players of Brighton's defense and then reached the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender, and then overtook them a few more to the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera who threw the right kick ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’re going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he scored at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League match.
That shot was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's pitch during that game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along his left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City are battling Hoffenheim in the group game of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to block the progress of the Rockies
Since Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a new start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, get into the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night at least to secure a spot in the wild-card draw, but still hope to win their first title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw in knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a crowd of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level that I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly willing to offer Scherzer a chance to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitch on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
Washington's right-hander scored 18:7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters’ turnout in the general election, the president cautiously commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be put to the test in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere, to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
Their intention is to take back power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control.
Democrats, he says, have a mission “to stand up and interfere.”
“You’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused widespread public outrage.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document — it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer in favour of dissent.
It does not tolerate the expression of personal opinions
I was not too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome – all because we said what we had in mind.
According to my colleague, Joan Ryan, they behaved in a similar way because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the motion of censure for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party's meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I've been working as a local Labour Party MP, the Friday night meetings of the General Council were just like that.
Unfortunately, nowadays, many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started not long after Jeremy became a leader, as associates I thought we shared similar political views with began to demand from me a drastic change of opinion and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was national security or a single-traded EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are plenty of offensive words on social media calling for my resignation, rejecting the centre’s policies and telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been sent to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me the most was tolerating offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal of distrust or change of election rules we become a narrower party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to shake my head, not to be so loud, and told me that then everything will be fine."
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, spurred on by the government’s neglect of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school’s multi-purpose classroom to decay, I’ve wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilor or a government minister.
I've never been in politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could have been misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is poised for a Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire for time and energy to be wasted on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether it's members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political gain will deter me from acting as I see fit in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat influenced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennent's Premiership league.
Now they have reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated out of ten teams.
Ultimately, top-notch defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
“So far we have been tested in every game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, “All honor to Ayra, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson to shoot Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was ruled out by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to lift the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by eleven before, at halftime, scoring a goal and making a stand-alone attempt to change the score for Ayr to 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose's second half started off well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
She then took a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott that they carried on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued the good game with Stafford McDowall's attempt to achieve Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced an extra player to pay, by an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to demolish the Clima who did not have the ball; from the penalty kick line, MacPherson made a lay-out behind Ayr in full swing.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, appears poised to resume service after it was revealed he had been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor stars as Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite TV series, whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to be shown, and it appears Kiernan is planning to dedicate his life to the aftermath of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in a "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that a court will grant it access to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the center of the sea full of cranes in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean is displayed on public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, or winglets: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost sea coast in favor of Chile during the resource conflicts of the 19th century is still alive – just like the desire for re-navigation of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1, following a five-year process, those hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Crowds of Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the surrender of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday’s ruling.
“We are in charge of the return of the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
“The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian leadership,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's war-torn rhetoric has buried Chile's every good will, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the dialogue, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “stop 139 years of mutual benefit disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea says it won't get nuclear weapons if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclear-armed if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during a meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the sanctions have continued due to "desert imaginations" and that the U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Last Line Of Big Head Covers Is On The Way To A Luxury Store In Your Neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely shelter the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion runway presented a line of loose-fitting giant headwear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the runway.
A copy that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that completely "takes over" the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had their lips sewn and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than pieces of high fashion.
One of the creations resembled a diving suit with a windshield and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a rim about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand behind an extremely impractical hat that has subdued social networks on the fashion runway has sent another great creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
The sunken orange raffle bag, decorated with raffles and a white leather handle, was an exhibition sample in the Jacquemus' La Riviera summer collection for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories."
John Edward: The Language Skills That the World's Citizens Need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with yet another package of outstanding exam results, and added weight to this by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement this school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart.”
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by students from independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent score for Mandarin, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest score possible.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of a language-skilled workforce.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs demand knowledge of languages, these skills are key in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives them an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language that speaks a bilingual percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of countries with a developing economy, they will have more opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, each school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will choose the languages considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a diverse selection, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which learners will prepare and equip themselves with the skills necessary for success, no matter what the future holds for us.
We cannot ignore the fact that in today's global business, knowledge of the language is very important for the future of each country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer a choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will play in the Lakers jersey for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first appearance for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don’t know how many minutes it will take.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans at the Lakers consisting of six games.
“At this stage of my career, I really don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign at a number of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned gatherings that Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nominees that sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate’s confirmatory decision has been on hold for a week until the FBI investigation ends.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain an election advantage in November.
Trump’s presidential campaign headquarters said the five rallies scheduled for next week were designed to “stimulate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"The majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a tumultuous campaign," Trump's anonymous campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month, winning by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in the polls,” political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team left their hearts on the field ahead of Sunday's individual bouts
After three one-sided sessions on Sunday afternoon, the pair's race may have been exactly what needed to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"The Wheel of Fortune Turns" is a saying that is especially valid in sports and that athletes believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
To whom is the wheel of happiness now favored?
“They had six points advantage and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead by four points, while there are still 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouraged by his play paired with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the all-day game.
Spieth has played murderously from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheering cheers grew louder as Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, culminating in a key road that led to Spieth's undefeated result.
After the path he won the 15-hole game, there followed a similar cheering cry in which one can recognize the hope and faith that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just have to focus and think about your game,” Spieth said.
All that remains for the players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of the Ryder Cup.
A European odd but irresistible pair has the maximum number of points and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that they are the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both win at the same time on different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly settled on Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's couple's game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the pitch buried a Spaniard and a Swedish in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, there will be no one on Sunday to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It’s fascinating to watch couples’ games up close because you can see player-to-pair interactions, hear advice they give and those they don’t, and study a strategy that can change at a moment’s notice.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team, and on the last day they come in with a significant advantage, but this pairing game has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting ability, which some, especially the Stateside, have suspected.
Europeans on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's pairings on the final day of the Ryder Cup come in with a significant lead over the US of 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led with four points difference at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in an effort to win the trophy she missed at Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in pairs, achieving a score of 3:1.
The U.S. team showed more fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophy, the team of Jim Furyk must collect eight points in 12 individual games that are held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debutant from the European team to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are only the second pair to win four points in pairs in Ryder Cup history after the sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 in fourballs and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to play with his partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But for the Europeans, not everything went exactly as lubricated during a pleasant day south-east of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting the bar high for their U.S. team.
They first defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was behind four points managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needs an undefeated result to retain the trophy.
After two days in arrears, it seems that their Sunday counterattack will be hard to fall.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust of the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test station, and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
“However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States,” he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have confidence in our national security either. Under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to the "gradual" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be gradually lifted from sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made a promise to work on “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants to formally end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also ignored calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on denuclearization and increases the pressure through sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" he said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a misconception of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there are plans for the second Kim-Trump meeting that the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in have held as many as three meetings in the past five months, adding: “If denuclearization was sought by South Korea, not by the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.”
Despite everything, the tone of Minister Rio's speech differed greatly from that of last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental U.S. with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened North Korea’s “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in disarmament, but added there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missile program in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio at the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would revisit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea summoned him after a few hours because of “gangster demands.”
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex, which will take place if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these “appropriate measures” relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps toward stabilizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic has found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find out about this only now, in my last year of college?”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University’s Health Service Paul Barreira says the University has decided to introduce the course after students noticed a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student dormitory where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in all-day learning before the exam still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his lectures in Harvard's first year.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all graduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's score scuttled Steven Gerrard's defense and ended the game with Livingston's 1–0 win.
The Ibrox team wanted to achieve their first away win after the February triumph and a 4:1 score at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, so his team now lags eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the lead.
Menga scored the event seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and didn't seem to match the score.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one event of difference behind the Hibernians.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the sides and so competed alongside Ayr until the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingstone line-up that the Hearts had taken the measure last week and would be delighted to see his well-designed line-up suffocating any attempt at an opponent.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston scored more with it.
They had the chance to make it two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game, opening up space for Scott Pittman to head towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free-kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise blow to the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that the judge should have sentenced him to eleven in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not heed Columbia's request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to score only two balls, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and a pitiful blow to Ovie Ejaria was not a big problem.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play has slowed the game down, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Meng for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The substitution almost had an immediate effect as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett took one long hit after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide corner inning.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an 11-yarder because he had gotten mixed up with Jacobs, but this time Thomson turned his gaze.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now we have a page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago...the birthday of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from that invention a device known as the Geiger counter was later developed.
Geiger's numerator became the mainstay of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado," in which the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the lead roles:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Look at that, it’s just being heard!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Bad Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them.
‘The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure involves the removal of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
The cells are treated to “recognize” the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing the immune system cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to be able to “recognize” a protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from the patient and “learning” how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after hosting Saturday Night Live, was involved in and supportive of Trump, wearing a cap that read, “Let’s Make America Great Again.”
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-up performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap that read “Make America Great Again,” he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they say to me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I'm worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's speech on social media was shared by comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to scare West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being pushed behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They treated me badly!
They said I was sunk," reports the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?", and said he would wear his Superman cloak because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused public outrage at least twice, and members of Saturday Night Live felt embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio was quiet."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, stunned many.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the people with the bravest spirit: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE MAFIA."
The show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just his own and that it was absolutely wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by the sum of his music, clothing, or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
"We are too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now be "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late musical legend Prince changed its name to the symbol, and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted knife-wielding at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star of the series Game of Thrones Kit Harington bent on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing Jon Snow who wields a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor succumbed to the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, has admitted that he wants to "very decisively" address the issue.
“Personally, I feel very determined at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, compared to the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to very masculine characters on screens, could be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, and that makes boys feel that they must have these certain traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something has gone wrong for the boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming sequels to the Game of Thrones series after it ended next summer and said he was “finished with the battlefields and the horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard's True West theatrical play, a story about a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that had happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming this series, which gave me a family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kite's character Jon Snow, in a fantastic Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases of the disease
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that a person infected with HIV in this way is almost absent.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of the HIV virus through sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Studies estimate that due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV drugs in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public's staff gave GOP senators information, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles says the claims are being spread by "ultra-right wing" individuals as well as websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The release reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the data belongs to Waters' office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters said.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking that data.
These unsubstantiated statements are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the accused's motives.
You have to be calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Barbara Walters to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing against Waters in the general election, also took to Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" of these false claims.
"We will make sure that perpetrators are identified and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she said.
“Johnny English: Back on the Job” Review: Rowan Atkinson Fights Spy
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems so in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel, "Johnny English" was shown for the first time in 2003 and returned to the big screens in 2011 with the title "Johnny English ja<0xC5><0xA1>e" again.
Will the self-satisfied satire about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his trained eyes and rubbery face is once again allowed to complicate the situation, while the name more than anything tells him that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a disgruntled secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to "diluted" glamour, recalls Inspector Clouseau, has a dash of Mr Bean's character, and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the Loyal Olympics.
His character is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the embodiment of chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but the humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Impossible Missions" offer elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English’s off-the-shelf adventures are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s silent geeks embodied in Mr Bean’s character.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker has entered Britain's most secretive spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, who is unfortunately briefly portrayed by Kevin Eldon.
This spilled a glass of the prime minister’s patience, the overbearing and belligerent figure who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character that should represent Theresa May, but she didn’t exactly get the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless with Johnny English's head and beard, who is currently employed as the headmaster of a high school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here there are a few handsome geeks because English teaches spying in the rocker style.
Englisha is quickly taken to government offices for an emergency meeting, where he reunites with Bough, a former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so the two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, who was incarnated by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous coincidences: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to an upscale French restaurant, cause a huge mess by sneaking into a luxury yacht on Volta, and English provokes a complete anarchy by trying to use a virtual earpiece to make use of a headset.
Everything was done properly for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and voluptuous the film was, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a central achievement.
And as was the case with other films about Johnny English, I wondered again if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the bosses of the companies to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to the workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could fit into the party’s economic program and plans for the country to favor workers’ interests.
The trade union congress supported a shift to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day workweek will not be realized overnight, but it represents a trend that fits into this party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as into this party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this aspiration.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to seize power from the hands of "unlike directors" and "profits" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to repay their entire stake because the Labour government could make “deductions” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to provide 10% of private company capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility the FBI might discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the statements were made, and asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved in stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should be strongly accused of changing that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she appointed were able to confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see that anything has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only performances by stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making phone calls, or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal by taking a leap.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – where people feel that signing an online petition or tweeting really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have sought to achieve a range of different goals.
These actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and implementers in the United Kingdom who are committed to “helping these children develop to their full potential”, with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million in aid to the target area.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a mere footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website that reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we’ll fail.
But we will succeed, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements did before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the performances at this year’s event in New York that will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russian engagement in Syria "especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government" is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in this area, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
But, in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the opening of sea lanes and the blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance that presents itself in the U.S. as “the voice of the energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, adding that Russia is "using the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as the Trump administration’s intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply fueled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to steer clear of EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" her candidacy for president after the mid-term elections.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman in charge," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading in the wrong direction."
“I am terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Center for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent voting for the potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential race for president in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence that occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, is comparable to other families feeling the consequences of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem of which she is silent and for her son and other war veterans she said that "they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, gave to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of family violence reporting, and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Department.
18 U.S. states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to provide support to an asylum seeker who disputes the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" were abusing her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has changed the Immigration Committee's decision in 2014 to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be settled on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle violates that principle,” the report said.
Lawyers also argued that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles bring in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, roaming through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were cramped.
Some of the injured, including Dwija Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, were resting in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated in the open air for continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was crushed inside the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "mistreatment" through "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page long ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid addition to the China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a statement to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “now doubles that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have about China’s disturbing economic path because the media is under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to make an offer to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspapers were involved.
Kavanaugh's debacle has pushed Republicans away before midterm elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were extremely agitated, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things can't come back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School of Political Science, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) latest insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: “November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate aisle as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be beyond all expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court judge candidate, analysts suggest there could be a negative reaction if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about how Republicans approached all of this and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with little more leaning towards him.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the veracity of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of their data storage and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, commitment lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is the decision of who can access what information entirely from the users.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely turned over overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a statement, Berners-Lee said Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the awarding of the First World War priest with the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honour of the only priest of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the venture of his grandfather for whom it was awarded.
According to a report in the official London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Channel "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
He later rushed to the front lines and, with “incredible courage,” led the unit forward before rushing to the Polish cannon without anyone’s help and slaughtering the three of them from the military detachment.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I could never achieve, and that excites humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honoured to be participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, and instead they got Peppa Pigs
Imagine this: you stay up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will be unable to watch the main event.
The San Jose program consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main roster, and in the UK they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in the UK were left in shock when the broadcast was interrupted by Pra<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> Peppa.
Many were not at all impressed after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning just for the fight.
One fan described the interruption of children's cartoons on Twitter as a "some sick joke".
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Juppy, 'Dress Peppa,'"
Bellator President Scott Coker said he would coordinate his schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about repricing, I think we can probably fix something,” Coker said.
“But the transmission is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until there is a Sunday with us, when there will already be a Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a matter of state nature.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate circumstance."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" in terms of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority to others because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he wasn’t aware that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
In a statement to Radio 4’s Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a renegade on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others during his upbringing because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference from others have been the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.
He says he wanted to prove he was “something” so he wouldn’t let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a prominent advocate for LGBT people and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he believed he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with the man "American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years his senior last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you're so young, you go through so much," he said of his first Olympic games when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, saying it was hard to find someone the same year and that he had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had purchased tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be here long enough to be in the first place,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he exhaled, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I finally became aware that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve been dreaming of all my life, to jump in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.

Mickelson out of form on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to fully recover form to avoid an awkward turnaround.
Mickelson, who plays a record twelfth time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working out his game at the practice in the hope of correcting what was troubling him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National course, where a long uneven course routinely punishes inaccurate shots.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Frances Molinari, who won all four matches this week with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man "more than that and he couldn't say.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't think he'd play two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's how we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the number of Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for that,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in the match at Valderrama in 1997, where Captain Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a close difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0xB6> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always remember that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a close difference,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win the result of the 5th and 6th Nationals on Thursday.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll be playing full strength tomorrow.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors are announced on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who is opposite us – the biggest players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of the ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the big day, and it's something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you’re there as an individual, the final exam is your golfer skills.
It's a message that you have to convey to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to give their best.
Now leave your partner because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they have played with their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of these major setbacks last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser after Europe performed a “miracle in Medina.”
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start, like what you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medina.
When this advantage starts in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our show and set the guys up as if, you know, we were going to try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys goes in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship to be put on hold again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years without returning to the home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to show power abroad, will become obsolete by the time of entry into service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to let the ship go and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors <0xCC><0xB6> half less than on older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been found to be dramatically over-heavy, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) <0xCC><0xB6> compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the sailors were actually "surviving ships capable of deployment".
The official said that the problem has increased over time, as the old ships were put out of service, and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of a bat.
New research conducted at the Scottish Highlands estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow common and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile screenings using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind it does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as meadow formation and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and work on the arrangement that affect the shelters and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flywheels and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of cats of pets.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on the path of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threeva estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats inhabiting Scotland.
Manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
“We have a lot of space for bats here in Threeve,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before the start of maintenance work inside the building, since unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and juveniles, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the representative for the Scottish Association for the Protection of Bats, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their population is progressing.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the rape charges against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published those accusations.
A Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner in camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the footballer added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at an apartment in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that “99 percent” is a “good guy” who was let down by that “one percent.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer.
Brexit: UK Will 'Forever Regret' What It Lost Car Manufacturers
The UK will “forever regret” if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production downtime at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnastone.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal due to possible consequences for cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire would not be able to hold more supplies than it needs for a day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but they warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of Unite unions, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have come up with a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “suspended for another week” as the fight for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election meddling, the ties between Trump’s associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has been stirring up controversy in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing witnessed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's lawsuits, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a consequence of the TV reporters’ “theatrical behavior,” although she said, “I will not oppose the fact that they are getting mixed up.”
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is organizing more meetings to answer questions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've analyzed the numbers."
A brief address will continue to happen, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and that's what you've been able to see in the last few weeks, and it's precisely that you can talk to the president of the United States that will replace briefs for journalists."
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, in a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff employed by the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to meet the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday loss to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31–27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the line of play and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the edge of the field before putting him on stretchers and sending him for further tests.
A representative for Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no “details on the type/range of the injury” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year playing career, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shots before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shots per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This step will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters.
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional money will contribute to the Government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional tax <0xCC><0xB6> that is charged to the current tax, including the increase that was introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for issuance <0xCC><0xB6> can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who do not have a UK residence, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many of the country’s rich areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and called on Mrs. May to abandon the quota on affordable real estate to fix the “shame over the housing situation” in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the end of nothing-caused layoffs.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to renewing the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as worthy Brits.
The dream of owning a home has become too far for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “extreme ambition” is to one day become Scotland’s manager.
Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren again at the Scottish Football Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and that always pulled me back.
However, this opportunity could only be realized if I were successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
Alloa Athletic's former boss says he didn't feel afraid because he inherits such well-known names in such a big club, having previously turned down calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now will be measured by whether I can bring this club back into the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his managerial career, after a period of as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts’ coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from a fall in the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the next season's champion title winners.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” recalled Alloe’s takeover.
“I really believed that managing was what suited me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, making a solid income and enjoying pretty successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for pints is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research shows
The summer heat wave has increased revenue for British pubs struggling with finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars posted a 2.7 per cent increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Chief Accountant, which collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues were still up by 2.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have made much greater profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where mostly food is served have also been affected by the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 per cent over the month, and food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for rest and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the external market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
Long hot summers could not have come at a worse time for food-serving local leaders, and the weather will show whether the more temperate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand share growth.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales tracking system for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and an industrial benchmark has been established.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that shows their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, open secret accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to a photo-sharing website.
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a cleaned “main” account to show their parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother who found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others with the words “rape me”.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of an athlete" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a board member,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of the athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, out of his total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, was no longer able to walk after a passing ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he completely recovered, learned to walk again and today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement."
Distributed opinions on the Internet about advertising for a traitor who compares mothers with cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed their children with cows that prompted the muse shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable traitor,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new traitor gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stall filled with hay and cows with music whose lyrics read: "Yes, I can see myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not a vime, it's my breasts."
Then the phrase follows: "Pump, pump, feed the baby with it, pump, pump, my lady's husband."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “threats.”
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
Traitor Elvie discreetly fits into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
The second person comments: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: “Totally pointless advertising.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was "ridiculous".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I had more, I'd buy one.
The delivery of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I figured it out just the way it is.
“It’s a brilliant product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at moms who give milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like a ‘cow’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The campaign concept is based on the knowledge that many women who give milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even get out during delivery.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother, commented: “Treasuremaker Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to focus on the betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the fashion runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased even though the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration made it harder for children to be placed under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping down and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor an unaccompanied minor.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor’s household in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal outsiders.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
According to the statements of shelter workers, in order to speed up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, and not after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, rather than in person, to present their case to the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers’ statements and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
Advocates said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is highly likely that signs that a child is being bullied will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until it clears all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with Russian support on a province home to three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra-linked al-Qaeda front, "which will be eradicated."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to a revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
There are currently no signs of viewer murder.
Since 2014, hit-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on a hit date, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has outperformed the viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers at major news broadcast evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s about something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” said of the secretary of government who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
In chaos, there is fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law that came out of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you realize that for the sixth hour you've been watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used "deep background" sources for his book "Fear," about Paul Manafort's $15,000 Noah's Ark jacket, and the "Dresss-Up" of Mr. and Mrs. Obama.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.

When I reached Mr. Fleissa this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and simultaneously filming CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.

The money from the outside slides into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Circuit is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates competing for the same seat.
This recently restructured district of the suburban part of Pittsburgh is highlighted by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
Lamb competes against the second current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally garnished in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign funding battle between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Funding Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely-accompanied March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. is considering whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraw
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to call on U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year that was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History (disambiguation)
The next thing that could be prepared is a report by special investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which now has very substantial public evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly negotiated with Russia as part of her attack on our election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps ultimately with a jury of his peers.
There are many such "ifs" and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Truman's inevitable fall - nor those similar to him in Europe.
We all need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the implacable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these papers reported that last year he had secretly proposed a recording of the president and conjectured about his incompetence.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently ordered investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or honest, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once dined in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with a crucifix.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic about facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the European League Group G.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing we could achieve something and we got a point.
We may have been able to steal the game in the end, but overall, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another great European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study respondents said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay those costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Hire health representatives to identify a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving powers of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your bills if you are not able to.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your aging parent finds himself in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please include details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hands."
Man shot multiple times from Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was repeatedly shot from an air rifle while returning home after a night out.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, aid officials could not obtain any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Niasa, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of the building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of family violence reporting, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su's custody and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course" when asked about his guilty plea, the network said.
Palina is charged with three Class A offences, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Saru Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck close to central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, in which he mutilated pedestrians and cyclists who found him on the road in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points lead to the eventual death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal grand jury struck a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferru<0xC4><0x8D>i, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Paji<0xC4><0x8D>ani.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last prosecuted the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was the last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He has also requested that the flag of ISIS be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the People's Army" during protests at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of a eurosceptic since one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on Tuesday that the United Kingdom would have "come out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by the Tories’ pro-remaining supporters joining a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan amidst attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of the rest and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue her attempts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to “reject the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to expel the Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their mind and wanted to stay is completely inaccurate."
Conservative and Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also in the loop, addressing reporters with the words: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement, May said: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the gathering that politicians must be made to “feel the pressure” if they are to fail to make the 2016 referendum decision.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue a Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘You’re not going to get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic public, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilising the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A lot of activists waved banners “Tories against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party’s app during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for the unhindered state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s all a farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday in direct association with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
For some time now, there has been speculation that she could oppose Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that meant a woman in charge."
Arrest for the murder of LSU's Sims
Baton Rouge, La., police announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims, which took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dytheon Simpson at 11 a.m. at a press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early on Friday near the University of Southern campus.
“Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, at 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime and owned a gun and that he killed Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a 3rd-year high school student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 sets last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after his order secures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a big part in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to enter the market at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel-to-wheel action, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior in danger of lag after a double move in the third-curve defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he relied on his tyres to reach a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it into boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was tough because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did a really outstanding job to achieve the formation finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence on not releasing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and ugly and dishonest."
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, ugly and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at public disclosures and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave any information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public – ‘ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let go ... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t make her story public,” Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial did not meet the approval of the president, who commented at a meeting on Saturday night: “To tell you something – it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own ends.
“They are determined to bring back power at any cost.
You see the evil, the filth, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5–3 victory in Dundee on Saturday.
In the early minutes, the Giants came to the advantage of two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the draw, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season for the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 a.m., with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, assisted by David Rutherford to double the lead by finding Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the hasty opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt enabled Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The natives regrouped and Bouchard once again brought them to a tie in the measurement of the forces naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen for the first time in the second third, and he took care of the win when his team was already half way to victory in the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers in the plane avoid an earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of planes carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are reported missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower that was rocking strongly.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on Flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the death toll is still increasing, as many bodies are still under rubble, and many could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency ambulances bring in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
“There are small shops everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is being treated as missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that owns the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is being treated as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it was unable to trace any of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to break through the water that had descended to their waists to the exit in the event of a plane sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked nearby to repair the docks also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
Aviation safety network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in accidents involving air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst exposes weather review of the night a woman was burned alive
The District Attorney's Office on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used data from his cell phone to plot the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts his previous claims.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time when he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he “got it right, because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Data from the cell phone indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers's death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based singer-songwriter The High Breed says hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black woman?
New York City nanny sues couple for quitting after 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing a couple over a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected message from her mother calling her “another black woman.”
The pair deny they are racist, comparing the charge to “abduction.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her displeasure when, upon her arrival on her first working day in 2016, she learned that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NEEEE ANOTHER BLACK GIRL,” Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her wife.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "uncomfortable" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, for, as she claims, the fact that their then-ex-nurse, who was an African-American, was doing her job badly, and was expecting the Post to move to New York instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice sues the couple for a termination fee and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month period for which she was originally engaged, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to terminate Maurica's employment, out of fear that she would not be able to be trusted later because of the insult.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going to sue someone who's in a situation like this.
“That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, a court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s going to read the book for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small plush bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a braggart,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was experienced as some achievement of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed the credit exclusively to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye over the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that she was really bad and to believe that she would not get away with it," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad invited me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
Medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart working slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then everything was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what was going to happen next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything to myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were not aware of the temptation she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and my tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women's messages of grief on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile awaiting a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy.”
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in a “really dark state”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect.”
Mrs Davis came up with the idea of cards “so that people would know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the bottom when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or he wanted anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a big hole in the family.
Give us a break.
But we will continue to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought we might be able to bring in a little unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for – a time and scope limited investigation,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “break apart” amid an entrenched party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was prompted by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, Republicans are not doing well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is constantly calling on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'falls' under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors from North to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 during 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more tariffs that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from the North eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work for the liberation of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not take into account that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is incapable of serving in Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she ever behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated blackout" by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because it showed she had biases against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to recall Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed out.
“I’ll say the following: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not capable of not only being in the Supreme Court, but in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Abortion Act arising out of Roe v. Wade's lawsuit, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, the anger that has accumulated for months and years, cannot be rid of without pay.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the CEO and who said she cries when she gets angry, but she developed the technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she talks to says, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is that, on one occasion when I was crying because of unspeakable anger, an elderly woman <0xCC><0xB6> a cold manager that I was always a little afraid <0xCC><0xB6> pulled up to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they'll think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a Monkey Business boat and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already stalled, she was lagging behind in fundraising and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it harder to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism that her throat was squeezed.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled the media’s reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what it would put on my tombstone.
"She was crying."
How a trade war between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war has resonated loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the breakup between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, and recently imposed a tariff of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. with a blow, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to surrender anytime soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for triggering an economic meltdown in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinking scientist who focused on Asia at the Center for Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and existence are now fulfilled.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown while Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout almost the entire tournament, on 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water at the first stroke, leaving the match to Francesca Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of only four players ever to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth kicked Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player on the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop tears today.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
It's all up to the team. I'm happy that I could help," said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes on the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who in individual games on Sunday beat the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, by a score of 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud of the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At times, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to fight each other, I'm going to work with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat to the people.
We're overplayed."
