The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor the "paditory".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has "beaten down" members of the new Council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD a little bit as they master the notorious slang that has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite during the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark about these new terms.
At least they claim that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of "patent vocabulary".
But also the Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golden Flesh".
“This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use from time to time.”
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June of this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest gulf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "Stiernacken", "betrayal of the capital" and "stay".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised at first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and I don't judge how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other."
“It’s important to me how we understand ourselves as part of our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, is speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he correctly came up with during the test was "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, but added to the security: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I guess I'll have to take a language course."
The "Golden Flea" is then not only deciphered by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Environmental Affairs Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as the Blanka Tunnel.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means to go to some Prague gastronomy company", Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is quite close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
Consistent with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he asserts that he had drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, among the Social Democrats, there does not seem to be a similarly native slang.
“I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there’s really no such thing with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague's <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulda" by his party members salopp.
"At school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councilman Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "grandfather" or less friendly to the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations during party sponsorship, is called "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in intra-party language usage.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> supposedly does not like to be called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Gumball Rights" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are branded as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong more to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
When one of these women "becomes a witch", she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are very rarely affected by this fate.”
“Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help at work and give birth to children,” one nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, which takes care of more than one hundred women who have been evicted from their communities in a special home.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, published a brochure to prevent the "witch persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the newspaper “derStandard” pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment.
Witchcraft is, however, also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men – they poured oil on her and simply set her on fire.
This incident was also reported by the BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the case would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is ignited, which is used for ritual anointings.
This was after the group tried to “expel an evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to de-escalate the witch-hunt, the Gambian president himself has mixed well in the past year.
"President Yahya Jammeh triggered a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly had a stake in their death and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
“To this end, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President’s bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the trapped people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly 1,000 prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: While he is heating in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly mistreated man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have been increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to cover 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven," he points with an angry finger at the new lease of the son, for whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half voiced and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7 to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waved.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a major "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-based rent.
Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine in the morning on this Tuesday full breaking.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
"Rent 2011", so a special touchpad shines on the touchscreen.
Short taped and already the device spits out a number sticker.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
Starting in mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will flaunt most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG’s portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since November 18th.
"The action is a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation as the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ apartments are a hot topic.
Before the elections, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, a parliamentary vice-president from Ostrava, had taken up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change their toilet goggles," the man who was mentioned at the time said to himself.
So far, according to the employees, mainly pensioners are at the counter to convince themselves whether they really get the promised rent reduction, which promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.
In order to benefit from a half-reduced rent in February, the other tenants who sign the new lease are also expected to arrive by December 15.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded with demand.
“Of yesterday’s 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were due here,” the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements both on its websites and on wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be decided by an independent court.
“This is not intended to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal course of action,” RPG said on its website.
“No one is going to court here,” says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (crown) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a lawsuit," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the imposed tenants is, in the opinion of the house owners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in the apartments from 2005 to 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red-lighting information appears in between.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, which means more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
“Always, this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month,” reads the LCD monitor.
In just 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase of extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not jump up the rents, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The Arch.Design design and architecture office, whose studios come from a number of well-known Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
Wisely, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is committed to ensuring that the designers and architects return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Along with the opportunity to work in short, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for the civil engineers to bring their demanding profession and childcare under one roof.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design employees and with the support of management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grant of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After exhausting the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating actively assisting in the processing of applications.
The children are taken care of full-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but several children change over the day.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus eliminates the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employee relationships.
Arch.Design ranked among the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are torn up fish mussels.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the scales-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and creatures.
It is only after a closer look that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the whole fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same oscillating lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even look holes and rails.
The house Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately agreed to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> rental house was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created, and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> in Park G<0xC3><0xBC>ell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house received from the local inhabitants its organic forms due to the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "hanging house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed for the house a central heating system unique for the time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre is already hinting at her 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be swayed by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified by the result when it was completed that they asked for a remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also came across the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the district's request in this regard, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> submitted an application for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a lounge, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
However, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s renovation also gave the house a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is clad and the lighthouses are also impressive.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 2005, is open to everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly profitable business, the visits were maintained, yes, they were also extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the house residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bedding? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bedding - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be harmoniously complemented in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms under them.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
“Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they couldn’t sleep properly here.”
"For their shrunken shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco-foam (Memory Foam - a shape-memory polymer)."
“I also recommend this to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the “information” from the joints and skin badly,” explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I have already provided these mattresses with visco-foam (memory foam) to many ice hockey players, as well as other customers, years ago.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco-foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it fits exactly on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don’t roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound burning).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add to the body size the length of the soles of the feet, that is, about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are 180 cm tall, need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm wide, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the craftsman of upholsterers and room decorators, who for years has been familiar with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of this furniture.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grate at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the mold layer and the fine padding.
"With your hand or when you sit down, you should not feel the feathers in any way," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like cots have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already happening today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) screen.
Also for this reason, professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years for mattresses, even a lifetime guarantee.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though today usually mattress covers with round zippers are made, so that after opening you get two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often suggests the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should preferably provide the plate with ventilation holes (unless they are already inside) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket springs and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
For non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 spring strips (slats), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always paying for slats with a larger number of slats, i.e. from 28 and more spring strips, with lordose support in the lumbar region and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
Adjustable slat grilles do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed in or even angled in such a way that they allow the punctual sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also meant - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic spring systems (lattoflex) or grids with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as the Scandinavians like it, for example, will appear.
In the side position, the pillow should balance the shoulder height (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress).
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (with hay filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Even with mattresses, the new magic word is "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used to produce polyurethane foams – for example castor and soy oil.
Soybeans are used by all known manufacturers.
“Bio is the name of mattresses, whose core is made of materials of pure natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, it is also possible to treat microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here, too, a difference is made between a man and a woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red pepper shoots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortable warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to wrap 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually taxed with a lower value added tax, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the grate is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with concealed visco-foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the Tempur material that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
In this way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep the kids in control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can just as well locate people, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it is unlikely to be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and horror and so they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about circumspection, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the Macro Weil company, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing, but we have not had such a case to record so far."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of him.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"At first, the phones were very much expected by the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In her opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"With planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which to locate it."
"Today it's the cell phone."
“If such surveillance devices found wider use, they would also look for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising.”
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to record a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either devices in matchbox size, similar to trailers, or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are therefore being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he only notices after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a head start," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of location function using the GPS system (as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap around the whole Czech Republic but you could only hold it for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cord, with explosives being ignited.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have been providing for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the joint-stock company STV Group, a.s. for 40 million kroner.
In its justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed to it, it emerges from this statement that the whole army had to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Pickek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be justified in half.
This is equivalent to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies, that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely enough, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also in view of the increased demand of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns, so shooting exercises are severely restricted due to lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand why they buy so many matches from us."
But ultimately, that’s their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer that we as a dealer want to meet as far as possible," says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, sales manager of STV Group.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cord by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from the STV Group only talks about a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians even from only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four mentioned years are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the expiration of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek tells us the position of buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians, who liquidate ammunition from World War II or the Soviet fraternal army, barely exceeds 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the expiration of the service life.
Due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of modern and therefore reliable ignition cords is also open.
The Ministry of Defence is already facing huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People’s Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cord, which they bought today so "cheap".
To this day, I still have the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun's successful placement in the "Small Business of the Year" competition helped him sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year's winner of the "Small Business of the Year" competition was Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success sounds like a movie scenario.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware that in Liberec there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester university student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then rebuilt step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of business activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties have already reported on the franchise of the Pytloun hotels," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large part of this license sale to operate hotels had just won the Entrepreneur of the Year competition," Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the street, often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win immediately, any visibility is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that would not have been reached at all.
“With some of the people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a little down to each of his employees.
And there he is at seventy.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is given general recognition.”
I really don’t see this as just personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the company owner of Farmet, received the prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year last year.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts made by him to stamp a company from the ground from the small tool factory in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition,” said the winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop for lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, leaving his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, saucers and founded with a few comrades of his father a company of his own for the manufacture of plastic.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also came into the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, our foreign partners also began to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, to assign greater value," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year at Farmet, however, was not only a sign of victory euphoria.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic performance in 2008 and part of 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook citizens even less, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not avoid this situation."
"Turnovers fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, albeit with lower profits than before the crisis.
On one hand, the company was not willing to make cuts - in investments in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and so are the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
An opinion poll that cleans up with senseless regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless rules have already succeeded in getting out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in the future for checks on social security payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ.
The meaning and purpose of the "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll is to examine all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to abolish the nonsense.
This is the fourth time this year that it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organized by the German newspaper Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"As regards, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, down eight places from the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
The competition organiser then selects seven candidates for the "Anti-Price" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
This year’s opinion poll has already received more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless rules and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must submit every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of an event regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Trade Unions of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
“Where the state throws the entrepreneurs a knot between their legs, there can be no real economic upswing, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year that unnecessarily make their businesses more difficult for entrepreneurs today,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create senseless arrangements out of the world are proving effective.
In 2007, the people most bothered the imposed duty of entrepreneurs to notify the commercial officer at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or to a circus.
This obligation was lifted by virtue of a new commercial law.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Office employee journeys of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
The absurdity of the year 2009 was chosen by the decree, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the talking room.
This regulation was moderated somewhat this year by the Ministry of Health - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair ventures.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental consequences of their entrepreneurial activities and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as of the “Rebel of the Year” competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year, companies signed up for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the object of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, it is about disabled people, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the software company Et Netera, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports, appeared.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also takes great care of its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a fluid and also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week working time, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in its environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to keep the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment as low as possible,” explains Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region, in turn, is focused on the health of its employees and has therefore purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for them on all notebooks, in addition to promoting their work at home and at company events, they use mapping services offered by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We are providing our employees with food, a way to work, an increase in their qualifications and a holiday," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The Responsible Company of the Year category was automatically applied to all the district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
“A separate entry is not possible only for this competition, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate an ongoing public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition belonged to a specific interested party.
This is said to have paid Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo", she could not give further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released from police custody.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the face of scant official information.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the Fonds Boden, referred to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s question in this regard that the police had indeed made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Fonds Boden, during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public competition had the correct name "Call for tendering claims for transfer of land in accordance with the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants indicated interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer a higher value of their claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared value of the property within the scope of the request."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obviously had information available to those who had applied for the invitation and, since he was a person entitled to the request, since he had purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to withdraw from the competition in the interest of the property.
Obviously against a fat payoff.
That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had such a large amount of money with him at the time of his arrest.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had already had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement refunds, to which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. also acquired land from the land fund, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access highway to the commercial area Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged this very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to pay a heavy price in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to reckon with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and wastewater fees and for district heating and in some places rents will also grow.
Starting in January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month more from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places the district heating supplies will also cost more.
Electricity costs the housing households a few hundred crowns more per year.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants, is to blame.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more can be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices of district heating vary from city to city.
Larger cities, in particular, are planning to raise prices.
For example, from January, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating, more than 1000 crowns more per year for families in Liberec.
Residents of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges in the event that the city increases its infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater fees are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rent regulation will be eliminated from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to have a legal interest.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Far away, rum and vodka, except sometimes a good whiskey, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, according to which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen have to be treated most often in an emergency.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the head of the children's department at the Central Bohemian clinic Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice.
"Whiskey, if you manage to steal a bottle from your father from the house bar, and if you don't, then at least fart or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it does not smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> is right.
"Most often it's about distance or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was also about Slibowitz, who is taken from home," Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers have long been no exception in hospital admission.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first introduced with 3.5 per million alcohol in her blood and in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about it was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the head doctor said.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when instigating with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real addiction in the true sense of the word is not about children.
“Under alcoholism, a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood, and this is not the case with these children.”
For those who repeatedly drink alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains chief physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to Ms Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, about forty children who were drunk were admitted to the local Department of Pediatrics and Juvenile Medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required a hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home by their parents or possibly by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, in Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n’s opinion, there are three seasonal amplitudes on which there is a hundred percent reliance: Walpurgis night, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad testimony or out of joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night, I have also seen seven drunk children at once in the recording," emphasizes Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has to fight the next day only with an unpleasant hangover.
The headache in the morning after, which comes from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be expelled in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They are clearly better off because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting anywhere."
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” admits Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, sometimes spoiling the patient’s good mood by listing the costs they will incur from the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Time and again I used this as an educational tool when I directly predicted to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it could happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fat," added Dr. Pelikan.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to collect the costs necessary to cure the drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen at maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is the L-159T1 two-seater version, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
When she physically dispatches the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft, in turn, were isolated from long-term aircraft, without any further investments and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seater L-159T1 was replaced in its current state and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to cope without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million-dollar contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159s into a two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second one wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to push the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the buyer of the aircraft L-159 and that these are intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
“It is therefore up to the buyer how he realizes the matter,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The newspaper had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159s against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not advertised a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then-defence office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a court replay.
The European Commission brought an action before the European Court of Justice against the Czech Ministry of Defence on the grounds that the aircraft would have had to be selected on the basis of a pan-European tender and not on the basis of a single manufacturer's reply.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of getting cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men up to sixty," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already formed in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chair of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he was familiar with this study but did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be “completely proven”.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly snow, the winter waiters were in many places all night on the axis.
The highway D5 between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Klub (UAMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at kilometer 93, two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road.
There are also problems with kilometers 185 of the highway D1 towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave right behind Brno at 190 kilometers or drive over Brno and drive up at 182 kilometers at the town of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
This is where kilometre-long traffic jams are formed.
There was also an accident on the D11 at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself, there is a snow blanket several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns form, for example, in the district of Prosek, the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven express trains due to snowstorms.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11 am until 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasional snowfalls and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snowblowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
Three roads are still completely closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snowblowers to clear the snow.
When they will be able to drive again, it is not possible to estimate so far.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for reasons of nature protection can only be scattered with inert scattering agents, there is a snow blanket up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimetres, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly ceases to snow.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
U.S. troops have deployed a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only by its codename XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are guided to the target by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber shells developed for this rifle, which contain highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when impacting the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of “intelligent” technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he visualizes the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact point of view, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he just needs to press down.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"If you push back, the gun charges up and shoots the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated.
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance industry giant announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 of the Group’s jobs should be accommodated there, which have so far been distributed to the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, in addition, the large offices in Astro Park could better meet the way employees work.
Even in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt economic dissident Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was once again won.
This is a “great location confession.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed of the intention by the management at an early stage.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have given way.
Now it is a question of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time, acquired the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Based in Tokyo, Fujitsu is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad is based in Bad Homburg and the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped floor plan - the headquarters of the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry is located, among other things.
Amazon bans servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats’ desks.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is believed to be in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s watchlist, is set to stay in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks dislodged by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free," the disclosure activists said on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, the Internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic desks in order to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks said: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has halted the use of its servers by WikiLeaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman began investigations, CNN reported citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless actions jeopardize our national security and endanger lives around the globe," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted for alleged rape by authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There have even been calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said — apparently ironically — on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, an exchange of blows broke out.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced spying calls on diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now comprehensively testing the protection of its databases.
As a special representative, the vice director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary since the disclosure of the message reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the WikiLeaks release.
"We've done everything to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The Gelatier, in German somewhat ancient of the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream maker art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spatula, spreads it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can’t miss the “Gelato-University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture into the smooth ice of their vague yearnings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years she wants to do something of her own in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelators Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
What is decisive is not only good taste, but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately the teacher is stormed with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one let go of one’s own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar kernel flour from guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which turns with eggs into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes them each produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit ice.
More flavours, more fruit puree - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn’t necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice cream doesn’t require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously whipped cream and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small failures do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his fellow students are gluing themselves from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized rod mixer gets out of control.
"In any course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the blink of an eye
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been underwhelmed by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Christoph Then, head of test biotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a key role in the EFSA’s gene testing regulations and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest.
The EFSA regulations are word-for-word with Ilsi’s position papers and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has brought about a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking EFSA manager recently moved to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any restrictions or transition period - and thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed staff connections between a controlling EU authority and an industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians audacious.
However, the EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, should be used as long as they are of high professional quality, a statement said.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have any contacts with industry.
But they had to reveal it.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any animal feeding trials and the response of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize is doing on the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how do you find them?” the prosecutor asks.
Angelika Hilbeck thinks so too.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this field, as in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not associated with corporations.
For companies, critical studies would generally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lay-off of the station.
When it came to a stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shell lime, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of the blocks.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He groans, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the rocks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought everyone who was involved in the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground to rubble or disappeared into the landfill,” he says in his office, a log cabin that was once a shed.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything about the demolition.
And if it does happen, then it would be most sensible if the stones were to be reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos-heavy quads, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but also some in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what luggage compartment and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the spur have long since been transformed into "m<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or into limits of herb beds.
“Actually, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
“It’s not the political component.”
He climbs in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany he gathers his treasures.
He says he is the Republic's largest antique dealer.
There's a brake.
In the snow are artificially carved sandstones.
"You once belonged to the Dresden Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the road through the forest.
It points to a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
At one time the squares belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple bottle drawers and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal if you did something like that."
He did not become rich, nor did he become rich in stone.
But 14 people are employed by the stone trader today, in addition, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled down at the top of the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There's a lot of excitement at the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they are supposed to learn about the car of the future - and quite by the way get to know Volkswagen, together with VW developers.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates into the classrooms as early as possible before they enter the job market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, they try to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and tie them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting talent.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber toys and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them paths in the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: “Students come into contact with industry and gain experience.”
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
It’s a new thing to be so offensively bullied about students.
“Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project,” says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to be priced up and especially to work with highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even larger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern schnitzel hunt in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the U.S. next year.
By the way, participants can see KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to participate, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of the many applicants flies to the USA.
As the high-potentials at the universities come and go, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to pay the bill.
"We have been in contact with all participants in a similar action over the past year."
“Some are just about to graduate and want to apply with us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct bumps on campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to Pirsch in a classic way at trade fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About at Intersolar," reports Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of staff at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows about the problem of young people.
Currently, 35 jobs are advertised on the company website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write his diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often can't offer that," says HR manager St<0xC3><0xBC>be.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The Institute compiles an annual best list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager St<0xC3><0xBC>be also hopes that the placement will be a plus for job seekers.
“I think applicants are looking especially for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegerler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And this means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer branding is called, i.e., employer branding within one’s own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, then they would advertise to friends and acquaintances for their employer on their own.
"It's like a game with gangs," Kriegler says.
Obama Stops Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A similar ban has been enacted by the government in Washington - and thus definitively rescinded their previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is supposed to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Ahead of the disaster that killed 11 workers and led to the largest U.S. environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not been conclusively clarified to this day.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is facing billions of dollars in demands.
A commission of inquiry on Obama’s behalf is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the post-explosion drill stop.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
At the moment, the competent control authority, which had been discredited after numerous corruption allegations, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced the closure of lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," said the result of a recent industry survey by consulting firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what exactly will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People are living off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illuminate a boy wading to the chest in the water with the veils surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water-gloss, the scene looks almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude oil shale floats below the surface is not visible.
In the past, they have collected shrimp here, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of crude oil poured out of a brushed pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the entire extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat is brewing brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black licorice bars, saddeningly leaving palms to be found separately hanging their weed.
Bird swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, are in vain: as soon as the outboarder is silent, the spooky tranquility of the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, spreads.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari, “we live in constant danger to health.”
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni is a battleground that has been contested for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too busy for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied a return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of Switzerland’s triple size with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, year after year, according to experts: the amount of oil they pushed into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the crash of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” – one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is to be held responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU, it is disputed.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell has imposed much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner told the group in 2008: “The rate of defects in the lines alone is many times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are split-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to pipes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire breaks out: an illegal small-scale refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later kerosene drips out at the end of the line and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel a day: “This brings us 34,000 Naira” – around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal chefs can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of almost 40 euros per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from “bunkerers” who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, the country is losing at least 16 million liters of crude oil per day, according to experts throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a vanishingly small part of the provisionally intermediated raw material is illegally refined: the lion’s share is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and displaced on the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster is due to population movements or the lax mode of production is purely academic, according to activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has been so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group would be in question: “Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese will turn out to be better.”
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time you disappeared,” says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not threaten arrest, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, mainly from the north of the country, want to benefit from the raw material - like all Nigerians.
“This damn thing has put our country on the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous building defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety issue.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault in the investigation of an emergency-landed machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas aircraft were apparently much more fortunate than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, said in a statement published on Thursday by the ATSB.
This could have led to a “catastrophic engine failure”.
Rolls-Royce-manufactured engines in 20 A380-series aircraft were affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the supporting surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce set off an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Snowfall across the country triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic snows on Thursday night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east are partly 15 centimetres thick snow covers.
Traffic on several highways and many roads is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly resurfacing snow.
In addition, fierce buoys swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting storm surges of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on motorways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to Meteomedia, the alarm level was violet in Saxon Switzerland – the highest level ever.
Some 30 centimetres of new snow fell there, and fresh and strong winds caused blizzards.
There were several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snowstorms swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Centre.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although there were only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there were still almost 400 field beds available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in the collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she hitched her car to a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, and therefore already swirling in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is visited by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be invested in the property.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group is apparently looking to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes citing a spokesman.
The reason for the planned sale was not stated by the speaker.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell property ourselves and then rent it back,” he said.
As a result, Germany’s largest credit institution will be relocating its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from investors of an in-house fund and subsequently renovated them extensively.
The energy conversion swallowed up the data after about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, now renamed Greentowers, to be around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered, because the security situation in the accident pit is still precarious.
Just two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were dumped underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident pit, but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the comrades.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the abandoned miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country’s government buildings, the flags were flying at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would “come back to the surface from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been dumped.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, they will begin to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, Warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn reimagines old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman powers, kills his opponents in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid methods of killing his foes.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says the whole film without a word, and even the other characters can be dragged to one or two sentences at most, or a few excruciating death screams.
Otherwise, you will be silenced and immersed in the eeriely beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice when a movie has multiple audiences, but only if they mutually exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art-cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the surrounding brain mass and guts.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, the eyes of a troupe of violent Christian missionaries break off to Jerusalem via ship and capture an eternity in the lurch and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stern action, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
There is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and ties his throat very slowly with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that beats him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, who is faithful to one eye, preserves something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporary allies eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, arouse and amaze.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has released new information about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a stand - it still allows controls.
At midnight on September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley that deviates from the current.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology from the fifties hardly works.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
By computer animation, she dazzled where what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from close up or even the interior.
The reactor had been standing shortly before commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly more is known than at the time, yes the puzzles became larger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer only replied lapidary that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians managed to get rid of the rubble of the alleged “unused military building” and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers via a member state immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client – perhaps Israel – bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, this was rejected by the IAEA as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has dragged on without results and “is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority”, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna admits – after all, a serious violation of the nuclear arms embargo is in the room over which the IAEA is watching.
The IAEA seems to see three other facilities as key to progress in the field of reconnaissance, which are supposed to be “functionally connected” to the alleged reactor – and still exist other than this one.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants are involved, nor what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and identified a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - it is precisely with this justification that Syria denies the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has hints, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the Quader on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be “related to fuel production.”
There is, however, "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e., uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is run on uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from it, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which in 1998 examined Syria for its suitability as a repository for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from the orbit show that Syria was carrying out ground work at the three suspected sites and removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats had calmed down in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not a high urgency, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing in so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this direction: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives thought to: "What if in the end they find nothing at all?"
Love in Times of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her untitled directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much about it, but that’s enough.
The rumour persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some planned shooting days in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about the UNHCR UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself the ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims told her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended, according to the UN Refugee Agency, to dismiss Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read its script, has after some time granted a permission to shoot for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the conflict in Yugoslavia, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, its content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film is published online, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war broke out and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the variant "rape victims get involved in torture."
The fact that Jolie’s film actually begins before the war – so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now all you can do is bring peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by illegally putting the script on the net, as so many have done before.
Nothing like going away here
This evening, it’s finally all over again for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans shout with joy at the crackling loud music, they stomp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Cork is shaking because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and hit.
"Beerpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros prize winning plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will hold job interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a tingly feeling about it,” he says.
"It's so far from home and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, zuck her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks like on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are expected to leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI economic and social research institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered under Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, sadness is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly worrying for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far it has only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are piles of letters from young emigrants complaining: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation with it."
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future looming because the government is only doing eye-witnesses and offering young people no future prospects.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students hanging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to make a positive impression on the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round-the-clock service on the topic of working abroad.
“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something somewhere else, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are building a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home now, as he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little shy and walks through chilled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O’Donovan bought the house four years ago for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 – 100 percent financed by credit.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the credit might go wrong?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn’t like the heaviness he’s hearing a lot at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe that makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how life is going elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London and why should it not be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into a cheer party.
"Don't get too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Well, that sounds scary.”
“Let’s call it a walk-away party, quite casual, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
To these results came the Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of pro-democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year’s strong downturn, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year by 32%.)
However, from country to country, there are strong mood differences (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member were the victims of a crime in the last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Figure 6).
About 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, has nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
In contrast, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the United States as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election slip
No one expected the elections in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral assistants, who rushed to the aid of the embattled country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballots in the racetrack, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just part of the problem.
The polling stations were open hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were made homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the repeal of the election results because of an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election “quite good in many respects.”
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on December 7.
The expected pick is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no support among the voters, declares the electoral authority the winner of the by-election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election had not yet been issued.
There is a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Hidden in the middle
In the weeks following her husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether or not you will allow this to become a re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who steered economic policy even after his wife was elected, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further dismemberment.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others considered the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to talk about it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the president even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the figure to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then embellished the official inflation statistics.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now take a more moderate path?
She called on the private sector and trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to financially rejoin Argentina to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now, Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club funders, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the first step in cleaning up INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which for the most part has had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been met with them will be abated.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to quietly undo many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the straits?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, stood up to elect mayors and city councillors in the five city districts, which is seen as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot him in the face from the crowd, Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has undermined the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stirring up anti-Chinese sentiments too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s regency, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of working people and youth.
As a presidential candidate of the DPP, Tsai found great approval, as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it, too, is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's pre-fast approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will be reshaping his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a limited rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no going back.”
Grammy Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding Unexpectedly Awarded Newcomer of the Year
If you show up at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the category of newcomer of the year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist before the release of the album, with which he became known in the general public, released a maximum of three albums.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her evocative voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be quietly compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of the nomination Spaldings comes closest.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by saxophonist James Moody and "Positoutly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predatory New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, which otherwise featured albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of big group, so he competes against the Billy Childs Ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards feature a colourful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists have been nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's various "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium Artifici" by the -
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and the National Choir of The Mari.
As composers, P<0xC3><0xA4>rt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Instrumental soloists included pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpsichordist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated this year as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley.
“As an American, I’m proud of that.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
“They’re just very loud.”
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at an end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque, about 2,300 m2 in Mediterranean style, is said to have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live, among other things, from arsenic opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their opinion a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“This makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ way of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were released gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can trigger biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, she assumed that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemically similar behavior to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic has a different effect than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it lubricates almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can survive in arsenic also shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
The four exhibition dogs – two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information about the dogs' whereabouts or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
“We don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Whitmore said.
"We're tracking some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were reportedly unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised a finder's wage to anyone who could give a hint of the Corgis, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "preparatory" creditors plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
In fact, for MGM, Chapter 11 will only come into effect when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is leading the company, the funding is expected to be until mid-December.
Restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with a commission to investment bank Moelis & Co, the company’s management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to resolve MGM’s financial concerns and pay out the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started from the beginning when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
When MGM has officially passed bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, and this year the studio released only one film and produced an annual plan of seven or eight films to be released in cinemas in early 2012.
In addition, they are planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not yield any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronics toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s Law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, has a wider range.
More and more button-operated toys are coming to market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children over 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can not stop.
For a combination of voice and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay like ‘Simon Says’, and thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheel lock, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80’s kid, you probably remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better certainty with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter image.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for kids from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is all about putting the blocks together in words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised lettering contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet in Club Penguin, you can, for example, purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match character pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller shoes or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates and issuing orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan – China’s robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence – to impress the audience.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls they are!"
Four girls, barely out of the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white stripes.
“They look average to me,” Mr. Tang remarks disparagingly.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with low-lights: According to reports, in 2009, 50 officials circled around an improperly positioned snack cart and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police lines. They have been selected special because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
That's right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a bystander to death when he filmed them using his mobile phone as they staged a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street vendors.
“Chengguan is scaring the government,” the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough clean-up".
Skeptics find the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as visual distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonic facial features" were sought.
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too strenuous for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
“Female Chengguans are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that, they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, would not like to add to this description,
However, China admitted that size specifications in job ads are not uncommon for both genders.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is the same as good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lames or buckligens here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn’t feel sexist, so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short-term hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply scaring traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, raided after the rumor circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violent outbursts.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in a workshop instead of on the sidewalk, contrary to the regulations.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male stripe coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we talk verbally.”
"Sometimes physically as well," explains Mr. Li soberly.
“Most of the time, people start fighting.”
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that were levelled against him after his affair with a former campaign assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Up until the scandal that made headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been stopped and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and in your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first published in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign assistants, was helping to gain lucrative commissions to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Ensign's treasurer during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying work for them after he was hired.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign's electoral team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the door-to-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, “it appears to be an agreement and violation of the revolving door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Department appears to be very cautious in taking up political charges following a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop charges against the former Sen.
Prosecutors "are obviously horrifying," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have filed various charges against Mr. Ensign.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was told the ministry would not file any complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
"I'm not going to go into the details of the conversation between the Department of Justice and me, just to say that we think we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigations into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group after a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Election Act.
The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that has long supported the Senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that after Mr. Hampton's company passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "calling" at the Home Office about a matter.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, for lunch, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair was first released to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican ranking.
After noticing him for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would very quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and stop its investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work at the service of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the riots in the courtroom.
In a matter of minutes, they sent their reports of gruesome witness testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end when the verdict on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications with the court, setting out the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting on the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has led to a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of stirring details that the jury has been inadmissibly infested with public outrage.
This objection could prompt the Courts of Appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I’ve experienced during this process, I believe it’s really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects each individual’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s chief counsel.
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Jon C. Blue, dismissed the motions by decision last week briefly and bluntly when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court filings have found that reporting on notoriously infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its landmark 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his decision that there would have been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say lawsuits that look at Mr. Haye’s conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the avenues of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There's a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes being pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers are filing to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the selection of jurors.
Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he had inadmissiblely exerted pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over weeks.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a sentencing challenge filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
“Such a daily outcry from media pimps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has never been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more intrusive than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly is a tech-hostile view that is impeding reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said courts of appeal would often be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In her objection, she referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was overturned due to reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against 21st-century Maxwell."
Can politeness connect the separating?
After a campaign of defamation and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not break through the big questions that had to be addressed during the so-called “lame duck session,” the session at the end of a government period in which decisions are no longer made.
After all you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partial point-gathering.
The president’s public meeting of the deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, obfuscating the ideological divide that continues to separate members from one another.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - one requiring the other to show willingness to cooperate and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, Washington’s November election has been mild for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official with the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections rekindle partial passions that die out again.
And that's a good thing."
In some issues, especially those on the “lame duck session” agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, optimism has risen that these issues can be agreed during the “lame duck session” and at the same time the New START Treaty can be ratified.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful co-operation on pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to permanent co-operation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today to 2012 as pre-fight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the emergence of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
As worried as Republican leaders may be about playing too high a poker, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and put health care reform out of action.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of state spending.
Vice Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own estimation, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes and health care system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Party bias and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more consequential 2012 election.
In this regard, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that the two continue to separate.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the “kleptocracy” and it gives a part of the bribery money and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin, as reported in a memo in February by the American Embassy in Russia.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “verticals of authority” – takes its share of the money that heads up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
It was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that it has been cleared up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador’s report, individual persons are called, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led some to call it ‘disrupted’ and to conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the memo said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘kryshna’ (a term from the world of criminals/the mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that extends across the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is in the top spot."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are in the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is extensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay, find their business closed very quickly - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men carrying suitcases that were probably full of money going to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," Georgi Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow-based commission of experts, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Across the country, he estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from “least corrupt” to “most corrupt”).
The disclosure of the memo of the American embassy, which took place late in the evening after Moscow time, will surely provoke resentment within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that they solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we wouldn’t have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-time supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook telling the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodia tribunal convicted a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hampering their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, rehab or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Thailand on the Cambodian border.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces near the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the debilitating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, in court.
The court’s order is to convict the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the anxieties in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem came back from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to summon her, she would refuse to go, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
“If there were no more persecutions, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer era means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that, like everything else, they can understand."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Ministry of Education High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and soiled with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a tire pile here after his death in 1998.
Since Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to continue to stockpile weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapon-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material — according to an official, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama’s April “Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations,” which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012)."
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weaponized, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it showed interest in meeting a deal.
The first call to remove Belarus’ uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its stock by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, as evidenced by a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by WikiLeaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that the foreign aircraft are being intercepted."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing aid to human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega discussed the issue.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in the distance" and reaffirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unprepared to be surprised", Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since these are in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any distressing or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments,” Aguirre said.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely keen on their independence and doing what they considered appropriate," he had made remarks to his staffers that "rejected statements."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from an indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or intentionally ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the U.S. government," he said.
The child killer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "trouble" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is on the Internet "Muki".
From a young age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she broke up, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly after, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to do and let go of what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address I can send the boy to."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her first-born with her when all goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone else in life except my mother," a dubious intention when one considers their bad relationship.
There will be another email in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not satisfied."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, so shitty."
On the 30th another: "The boy is doing well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison evaporator".
"Terror a la gallega (<0xC3><0x9C>berschrift)".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunter, declares to have a conscience bite because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not recall the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the Little One."
Before that, however, she had confessed to having drowned César in the bathtub and to having stored his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on the parliamentary elections - preferably or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend – the result of the PSC’s redirection of the vote share and the PP’s electoral tie-up – were to continue, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also gain four (she now has 10) and the PSC would gain at least 9 deputies (at least).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while the ICV could keep its MPs or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will be with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the balance to put an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city governments with the largest budget for 2011: 66 million euros.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists will neither achieve a majority nor be able to rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not inconceivable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, in which it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona’s changeover, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the Barcelona police intelligence agency formed the Thai-controlled jihadist cell, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to liberate Tamil Bombay" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Attateen 2008
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been "weakened" worldwide and "thus their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy, so that their "fighters" could punish the borders of European and other Westerners.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. That is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It is possible that similar attacks will occur on the territory of the EU in the coming days, similar to the one that was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Eh Kilander were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - a part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular, tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigative circles, it is emphasized that so far no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the Bombay assassination could be detected, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the groups of recipients of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent out by means of a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commandos" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police seized a large amount of documentation.
PP demands from Mas a postponement of the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present to the President of the PPC the conditions in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already set during the election campaign and can be reconciled with the priority of the economic revival and the abandonment of regionalism.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with certainty, who awarded her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to make her feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on the opposition to vote for at least one of the parties.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC party chairperson is concerned, she calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the one in the Basque Country - to be submitted to a referendum in support of the inauguration.
Both political leaders agree that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not exclude that their caretaker killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they revealed the damage caused by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker who killed at least eleven elderly people, for whom he was responsible during his work - to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse those responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability oblige us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social standing because it had not established the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat roundly denied this point, stating that "missing measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there are no indications of negligent acts of any person other than the accused in the legal dispute.”
The man, who was already baptized as a "death angel" confessed to eleven murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and one and a half months later that he had murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail for six out of nine crimes committed to free the dying patients from their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done according to confession to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statements of the caregiver, not even as regards the number of confessed murders, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat posed by ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and the euro has hardly increased in points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent it collapses, albeit as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which require the ECB to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of state debts, as they are ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and send out a strong signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back, and if stubbornly insisting that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reaffirmed not to consider buying sovereign debt securities and the markets then collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, thus provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state’s wealth management only spent 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal’s interest rates fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland debt hole figures were published.
The total is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and a possible additional 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated her speech at the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, asking for political unity to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and employment measures, measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi’s Four Seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are relying on strong demand that will remove all doubts about our ability to convert.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now not only being matters, but also appearance.”
Have courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen fights at the request of his children the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owner of the companies Owls and El Enebro, does not disappoint.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the corporate group, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them to be "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal action for a new chapter of the judiciary in their dispute over control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be ready to surrender control of El Enebro’s institutions in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register as a defendant.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thaw in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The call of the judge to frame the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders’ meeting.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have them officially recognize the invalidated assembly of January 18 by means of legal ploys, fraudulent machinations and legal abuse".
This argument is the basis for the subsequent challenge of the assembly to declare it “absolutely void.”
The same protagonists, who are shrouded in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to call a meeting on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - the wealth company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez' seven children control 100% of the capital.
According to family protocols, the founder of the service group claims the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background to the case that the judge has to decide on in the hearing of the appeal for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes in this exquisite universe.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, in the final spurt last November, everyone was betting on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wishing to diminish the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that brought the German company to the market in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer science program, called PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants, and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull “in a few hours, almost in real time” can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected at the races and during the tests.
Russwurm points out that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly qualified young people, and with high-performance EDP systems they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit placed on this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits – especially by journalists – are severely limited.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the service of its participation on the racetracks are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose fame is equal to zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago it was still possible to say that progress in the field of R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to Open 20 Stores With Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a 20-store sales network of 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, vice president of HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, cited as an example the converted store on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working together for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first ones were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for opening a store is always the same, based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and pointed out that with the exclusive point of sale network, "the customer service and the advice of small and smallest companies in the purchase and after, even to optimize the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
“In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system has been developed especially for small and small companies as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' a million customers from its rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a collapse in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you subtract the customers that the bank will lose - which is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges that the bank faces with it will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the banks’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima roadmap, which was initially designed for three years this year, but was extended by one fiscal year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only emerge “slowly” from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities – which will punish interest margins – will be overturned, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their liquidity-providing issues will already be rolled over to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We didn’t turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high,” Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest differential (see Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the policy of "increasing fees" but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s roadmap is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not rule out corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
“In the coming year, everything will change,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently “enormously increasing” and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
After asserting that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of markets, he disproves the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repo transactions and thus catch up with the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase and retained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all the processes."
Speaking at a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process “was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely procedure established in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a”.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of unapologetic opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed unseriousness and insanity", because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a urges us to close before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world and added that those who doubted this would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we "do not have to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the abolition of the 426 euros of support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports of Barajas and El Prat, as well as 30 percent of the state of Barajas and El Prat.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is assumed that Merkel’s position is not a fault of her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark – although this sounds more like science fiction at the moment – is supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishing countries that fail to comply; possibly suspending some countries' payments and extending the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the drift between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has come out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the agreements of the European Union to allow the rescue of a country while obliging private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which is supposed to make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area, in which the opposing countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector must bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was cited by Spain during boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own home has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like anything would change.
Among the options that have been considered is the fact that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of unserious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and the Rule of Circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being poured on whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had clearly already won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but in this sport followed rules.
Part of the debate surrounding the case is due to the fact that a team of Real Madrid football club (who, in his anthem, professed nobility and honor and on other occasions had punished its players for similar incidents) played the main role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more pros and cons to his long history than theatral.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the opposing players from taking undue advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by false play or circumvention of rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is, what kind of advantage did the adversaries draw from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was not put in a more unfavorable position nor advantages were gained for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players.
The obvious advantage is that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also quit. In addition, with this procedure, players receive a sanction and move to the second card cycle, in which they quit with one card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is therefore not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass the sanction (this would actually be a clear case of rule-breaking), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or escaping from it.
Although the boundary between the inventive step and the control environment is blurred, I believe that this case is a clear case of inventive step.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic in nature.
Offer campaign to capture customers for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations on the 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to the Christmas season, which bring oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industries of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to also capture the customer segment, which is the great mass, and almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros a day.
To make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, the lowest prices will be demanded, confirms Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s, chairman of the Barcelona restaurant board.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it dozens of times before they reserve."
“They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are most in demand.
In a survey of various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads to the collapse of the providers.
The Soteras Group says that demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adjusted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 stores, is not losing its optimism after the second quarter saw revenues flourish again and good, albeit on a few days focused, prospects for the Christmas business.
Sources in the company group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more was added as a price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, green sprouts can also be seen, which is why the employees are invited again, giving the impression that the group business is booming again.
On the part of the Fecasarm Association (with associations such as the Bar Association, Restaurant Association and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Vice President, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "lively", although the customers "beat out a maximum".
However, the fun of the celebration did not go down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a cause for concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks’ revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program Washington is causing.
On the fringes of the clarifying and succinct details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country is "quickly" waiting for another one.
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report ahead of the visit of former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory attacked by the Taliban, the suspected dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer only seen by the US, but also by Russia as a source of outrage and a reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly credible personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and cultural background, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American office.
New to the documentation uncovered by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning and the increased pace at which Pakistan is manufacturing nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy, describing the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", declared: "Often there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to offers of help or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirmed that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clarify” to the person responsible that “Pakistan’s army has to cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.”
In search of Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red alert for the pursuit and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to elucidate.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red alert” to Assange’s “incarnation and persecution.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It's not new, it's November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens assures "the police would know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
As early as the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authorization by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and locate Assange, "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red alert as a cover letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is suspected.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who posted a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities’ questions via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied to leave Sweden and received the appropriate approval from the prosecutor, who is compared to the notorious Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and his mother from Australia swears on her son’s innocence – Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and thereby violate international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to step down," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to give Assange less attention is in stark contrast to the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to confiscate their funds and track anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to retract his statement that Assange must be “murdered.”
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and all that is not execution is one too mild punishment," he told Fox News.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in the ERC with a wink at Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe for an internal riot in the ranks of the ERC, which lost 11 MPs and half of the vote.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the next of kin of the former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former St.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the start, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could secretly comment on his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the president’s sentence, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission under his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod supporters are demanding more from the president than just making his office available to the party, an inadequate gesture as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the top body of congresses.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Executive Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, who in turn promises to submit to Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" harms stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current Councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologist, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the principle of assembly as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes that will allow congresses to meet with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s' team, which fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 shaking assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as the inflection of the internal turmoil of recent years was not advisable to address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the back burner, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, Mexico recorded four fewer cases than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México, four fewer than in the previous month.
Among the dead are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we come to a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a town in Toluca.

In the middle of the month, there were reports of the murder of two men wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza, in addition to the victims, two murder threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the village of Valle de los Reyes in the town of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, probably named Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to the news that his killers left next to him.

On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding images were discovered.
In the last half of the month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, next to a vehicle, the body of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group was found.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with adhesive tape, and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message supposedly signed by a criminal organization, stating: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet were found with traces of torture inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the settlement of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first had been headed in the settlement of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was encased in black plastic bags, next to it was a message, the second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its goals to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, according to Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country had invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he said China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on the matter.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programs.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year that includes targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy-saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the country’s government’s climate change science adviser, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be commonly believed.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent in the last five years and another one is expected to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist Party chairman had the right to address the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to address the National Commission for the Order and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudos’s appeal as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Ordnance Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he declared that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said the council would no doubt choose the one or the best president that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would hand the relays "to those that the council would determine."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open, and I'd be proud to transfer the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party’s upswing in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, even though “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "a lot of hopes and aspirations are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is up to the requirements."
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his discourse during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government expressions like those that he could make in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on speech and even less a censorship.
Obama on Twitter to advocate for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act Act, then call your senators and press for passing this law," the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act—the law to legalize undocumented students—with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act Act, then call your senators and push for passing that Act,” Obama tweeted.
His brief contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators outright, as the vote on the bill is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block any vote for any law except the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and the government’s funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blocking of Republicans from the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
Democratic Senate Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would "apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act—the law that would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students—can be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were less than sixteen years old while living in that country for the past five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or the military.
But the law’s proponents need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the proponents of this project are organizing an intense influence on the passage of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
That’s why the Dream Act advocates need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most outspoken Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had advocated for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
Put your fingers in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants became strong for the story
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of the other question.
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," said the Argentine writer sweetly to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, Montez<0xC3><0xAD>a, and Lurez<0xC3><0xAD>.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, of which he does not tell her a clue, but to guide her.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who stole her breath in the middle of the aisle, but who explains to her that the wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs relieved and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it really is open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'Lob of the Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he tells of a famous witch who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and reported of America, the great novel, which from the beginning was not lacking in its own chronicles, and he quotes the illustrious Bernadette D<0xC3><0xAD>al.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even came to give up the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lies approach each other, where you no longer know which side the narrative belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the “Tradition Cervantes.”
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'Der Finger in der W<0xC3><0xBC>nde' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for the drug trade.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintended commitment,” she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and readers as in a “chemical reaction.”
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also lead to dogmatisms, forgetting that "behind every affirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuance often means to put the finger into the wound and to annoy those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to acquiesce to the powerful, to acquiesce in the world.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different styles, defined by their respective coaches, are also opposed, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine played his way up to the second champion with the medal, he was one step behind the winners and surprisingly he played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos 4, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleventh minute he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put in his title, but threw three.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be chased again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, which I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," he said when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game is still strongly in his memory, he assures to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players also, because the last time we were ready to do it, I'm going to do it with two eleven meters before it is done."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elf-meter shooting does not disturb him, because he trusts this game to his players: "You never want to arrive at the elf-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared and badly prepared, but unfortunately, in the last tour we were prepared for the game, and in the last
It is in Romanso’s power to be no longer just a second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation at the consulate at the service points for the visa application; costs will be reduced by waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change at the Embassy of the United States and at the Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants have to present their initial letters in English to the visa application service (ASC) before they are interviewed at the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which will be checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, because it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over separately.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only need to introduce themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will be presented with their documents and their fingerprints taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate will remain there for less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service charge of $26.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that it would present “a supervisory finding for the search for extraterrestrial life,” triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that, in hostile environments previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist; it has been hypothesized that they could transform into intelligent living beings - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms, as the lake is heavily arsenic-containing.
In some ways, the microbe is using arsenic as a survival resource, and considering this ability, the chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that don’t have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it has been proven that "there is actually a different life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of its fund.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already installed, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the opening session of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the presidency led by Panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionalized their political position with these reforms.
He said that in the coming days, they would talk to representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, assuming their political will and if they did not have it, they would again be outlawed by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"So far I (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that don't even take into account the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For starters, this group starts with five MPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," the Convergencia member said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in reference to PAN and PRI, said that the Congress has currently turned into a 'boot' for two.
"Before it was just one party, now they divide it into two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo requested that Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
"Five, who are currently seen as divided into different factions, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have not been able to do so."
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Council pays another check to the disputed owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year amounts to 1.2 million pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144,56 pesos with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is monitored by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, it’s just the debts being paid, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on July 25 the examination of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that already before, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of the mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez had the municipality over 10 million pesos with 42 checks on Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that on different occasions, it was required to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as tourists would come to stroll and see the disorder, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians do not know what it means to have to close a company one day and they do not worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not carry out the construction work in this way slowly and without plan."
Hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the downfall of the tourist would have made the city aware of the lack of prevention and maintenance work.
"The church has to take its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How should it do that? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are looking forward to having a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito de Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents represent just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, because they would not be used properly and would create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought to the forefront together with the city. Making the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
“Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites that would first have to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to supply them with the inventory that we are promoting for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s corporate sector is calling for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in turmoil and is facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. This makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that the MPs will really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival compars of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the residents of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people’s representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary role in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second smallest resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been re-drafted in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes the next day, because the household is composed of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes hard times are called for because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go with the gores to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, Cayetana proposes clothing the size of a one-year-old.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive,'" Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe is 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah is 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Suspected Drug Dealers Arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis around the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the drugs were said to have been manufactured.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec's security police, said in a statement.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are believed to be the main drawers of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged with, among other things, the production of cannabis, the possession of which for sale, the conspiracy, and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that went on for over a year.
"The information received from public hands has allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrie regional investigation unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could easily be pursued
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships loaded with covert migrants, is expected to be scuttled after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I'm with a party that has tied you to the ground," Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, told lawmakers after the weekly Caucus session ended.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person to be detained for up to a year by a seagoing vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution of Rights and Freedoms as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does," Duceppe said.
Criticism of Olivia Chow’s immigration question, NDP, has been out of hand for critics who demand her party did not behave steadfastly enough towards the secret immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that action is being taken against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to enforce by passing another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians strongly tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a pedestrian.”
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Kenneys said.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative has said to QMI that the government would call a vote so that every opposition MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new unit to fight corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit enchanted by the hat" as well as "a solution properly based at a table".
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the contested, future unity.
“You will see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign from Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at ENA (the state university for the training of senior administrative officials).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposes to Quebec to give financial audit control a special mandate so that it can conduct appropriate investigations through corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the same power to the audit authority as commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the cabinets of the Charest government.
Quebec will also be required by Ottawa to amend the penal code in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelties concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the penal code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the Anti-Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several river courses remain under strict surveillance due to the heavy rains that have been pouring down in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been preemptively evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has fallen into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rain have poured down on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation was expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais valley were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain had fallen here.
Since snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-regions, is to be added to these precipitations, the breach of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alert for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentian mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of several lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was torn away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Center issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially rectified
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) due to his controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as his failed speech on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that although Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinions, certain statements had "inaccurate information about social care and unjustifiably negative representations of Haitians, as well as such an unflattering speech that is not broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who have committed suicide violates the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts in the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was lodged following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the disputed consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any offence against his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements made in connection with the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had had a media-effective discussion in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated in favor of the Haiti aid, since it was not known for sure whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspended sentence in this case."
"My file has been virginal for one and a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of unscrupulous expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, had to communicate its decisions once during the main broadcast time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thaiboxing, is now rising in search of new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, his character as a security officer and employee at UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
“Those fighters from every category were invited to be placed in the top four of the last World Cup.”
"I babed 2009 in Toronto Bronze fetched."
"In 2005 I became a backer in Vietnam."
“In 2007, I finished the tournament in fifth place in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto,” he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which punches and kicks as well as floor throws are allowed.
The duel usually takes place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter that has emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the King of Sanda Super-Tournament, the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without a tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually approved $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a total of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called the "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompanying manifestation of Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility to this important hydroelectric project in the amount of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of a conflation of competition and a rise in prices.
“This is a new way of playing a card game, and it’s de-energizing the competition.”
“This means that instead of playing a card game, instead of playing in a secret way, you are now performing in an open form,” said Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this in the afternoon by vehemently saying that this contract was a game of cards.
"I remain true to my line," she retorted, reinforcing that the PQ had gone "unreasonably" and that "it lacked hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is ongoing and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition being able to take place; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the consortium’s model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short flyby of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of lasting duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labor dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made it clear that the contract on project management was approved by agreement.
"If you bid and there are few applicants, your prices will go up quickly."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mars and tell you, you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
“The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people,” Laporte said.
This agreement, approved by the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, is part of a long list of agreements on more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that were awarded to companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had obtained 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had claimed that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the Parti libéral du Québec.
Minister Normandeau had complained that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that “financed” them, before clarifying that it was rather their executives.
Barometer Responsive Consumption - The "Green" Label Is Not Trustworthy
Greener, but unsurprisingly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players in sustainable growth, but equally little in the brands or eco-labels that are supposed to control his choice.
Too bad, even though it’s bathed in a media-efficient universe where it’s teeming with information in favor of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has complained of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that has become apparent as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading has shown.
Despite pushing ahead with the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admits that they have just as little faith in companies’ environmental commitment as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official, supposedly fair certificates attached to the products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently being revived by nearly one third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services that are being sought at their fingertips.
According to another announcement, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible – the Environmentally Conscious Consumption Index had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the car center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked by Société Angus and Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallele, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris owned by Daniel Langlois on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, apparently did not get what they asked for in order to return it to its actual cinematic function.
The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is instead offering a bond at a lower than initially expected level, which could create an existential solution to favorable conditions, at least according to sources detachable from the state’s rumor kitchens.
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million, had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and since then the petition has been resubmitted summarily.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have until December 31 to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, by making the argument that the Minister of Culture did not provide financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not have to do with other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained about substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years in great difficulty, which could justify the state treasury’s exceptional position.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele at bay.
Société Angus and the company Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a privately funded campaign, which they hope will raise a total of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The goal of the future buyers is to re-open the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the screening of Xavier Beauvois' highly successful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not called off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
The secret of complex-shattered Canada vented
The new U.S. diplomatic cables, distributed by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but at the same time expose the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind at the ballot box, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more poignant details than the mere substantial content one has to nibble at.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the interventions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"A near-indigenous inferiority complex caused by Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about the internal issues of everyday life than putting the United States in this election to black Peter (like the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands this "silence deafening" all the less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he said, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the run-up to the ballot.”
The other expression of this sense of importance can be read in the January 22, 2009 message from Terry Breese, a Ottawa-based businessman, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s continued confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, resulting from a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus program,” Breese said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed stimulus program.
Another January 2008 message, written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even evictions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by muscle protists of the CIA.
Another report details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner is said to have answered the question with a yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the act again".
Finally, let’s note that the mood regarding the WikiLeaks website is heating up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The United Nations has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalent to almost one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKW emitted to the earth due to lighting, if the white glowing pears, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global FFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would have to be subtracted from this balance in order to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice.
On average, the compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - by the way, this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, which should be used to indicate the savings opportunities of the exchange plan, which is modified in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that completely novel incandescent bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that it is therefore necessary to dispose of them as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a place of acceptance.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the gains that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underscores the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," the UN chief's spokesman said.
"He asks all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight to expire three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may finally declare the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN's practices of intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s lawsuits are considered by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically close associate of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has deemed the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential election was held to crown the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any outbursts.
Laurent Gbagbo led the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA), in the metropolis is at a stable 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7% with the inclusion of overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job; this included whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the youth between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months as well as over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% with the inclusion of overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds had been able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne region (PS), was investigated and was taken to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of social property, embezzlement of general goods, hegemony, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain spins."
“It’s easy to give him a series of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had attached importance to sending a memorandum of justification to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini’s, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then, under the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision, was released.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were alleged to him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other people were charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Handling and misappropriation of general goods by a public service agent", the other on the basis of "involvement in the misappropriation of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "sanctification and embezzlement of social property".
Among the people who were confronted by Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned for a similar case of fraudulent public conduct involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company has helped to launder money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, here in particular in the disposal branch, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous writing in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Sources close to the investigation show that the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the addition and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Affaire: the Elysée Palace Exaggerates Its Mediation Function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying", kept the French public in breath, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tean.
All this under the watchful eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give these advices on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostages” in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials have tried to convince Washington that the young French woman’s release does not have the benefit of the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held captive in France and sought by American justice for trafficking material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a bright light.
In fact, he had done nothing in that regard.
A diplomatic telegram published in Paris on August 12, 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage taking".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée’s strategic advisor, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
“Makes noise,” they said, “articulates loud and clear and without ceasing” the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release” in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do that."
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the attempts to discuss inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in avoidance maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a “routine, Iranian tactic”: “hostage for the purpose of political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was supposed to take place on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it clear that Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that “will intensify.”
The Iranians could “arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding from Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released from prison after a judge’s decision in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On the occasion of a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under “strict” supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser selects a telephone number, reinserts it, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently was in the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe, by means of statements and "flight attempts" organized by the media, that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that caused the Elysée to lapse this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of openness towards Syria,” he said.
A 2008 policy launched, which at the time "was perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Building up the Syrian role" Paris "trying to lead Syria in the face of what clemency one can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow twinning between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians did anything".
"But we thank them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law, called "the Cinderella", which will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill to urge online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning in school and also living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the draft law's deputy minister, told Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games for those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “networked” countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various Internet-related events.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the country of origin
The FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice in which the rowing for influence as well as lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its 2010 premiere on the African continent, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had given it fresh impetus on Monday by airing a documentary that features three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who had been lobbying primarily with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the chess movement, which was succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to restore the image of England in front of the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport) has become a significant outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwavering hint at the sightings of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
“You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-hosted the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s long-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which leaves the Asian chances of 2022 slumped.
With Australia and Qatar having pulled all the registers with the advent of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing their expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time delay) acquitted by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the transparency
De Gaulle had really stuttered.
Midterms had made him believe that he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be an ergo candidate in 2012.
But transparency is not well on the side of the mystery that holds the presidency.
So you have to act as if the doubt persists from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not ruled out without even believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone of voice that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP-parliamentarians the prospect of "two mandates" would be denounced, had spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
It's a long way off.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the day before; nor less.
If you want to make comments, there are two reasons.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the admission of competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS warn more early than assumed to combat fanfare.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% versus 44%, according to a BVA-L’Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the environment of the prime minister reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s central bank last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt can certainly not afford to implement today’s more than tense situation in the European bond markets, in order not to provoke their aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, speaking at a press conference yesterday, welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in favour of resolving Europe’s sovereign debt.
She has not dared to say whether she believes the central bank could do even more, for example by boosting its program of buying government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had shown himself in Brussels the day before on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament not very talkative about his plans, but rather merely to point out that the program of purchases of state securities would "be extended" to the secondary market.
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s treasury bond purchases were doubled to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion last week.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, yesterday she made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Overall, since May 2010, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion.
Among traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is in no way doubted (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable price change.
If the more than three months of bond transactions have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB will still be free to create unlimited reserves of funds over a period of one week to three months.
The economists already believe that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, Volkswirt der Commerzbank, suspects.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, Volkswirt bei Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that revives the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“At any price, it must step up to the plate of the missing investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bond holder testified yesterday.
After all, if interest rates begin to soar, states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi's government in Italy
After a worrisome start to the week for Italy, the situation has eased a bit yesterday with the decline in key interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional president Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "indecipherable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the concerned, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at any rate, German interest rates had reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In a nutshell, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dwindling tax revenues that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 . . . although the Senate budget is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (against the government’s forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the riot for a new budget collective, which could be used for a total of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) requires less stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political inconsistency remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
There is, therefore, an unfavourable period ahead for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency as well as their currency area".
Although quite relative - the decrease recorded yesterday in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt record, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdening the banking systems," according to the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
This is also the case with regard to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the countries of the eurozone in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
As far as the EU's Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first roll-out of the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, in turn, are committed to structural reforms, especially in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
It is up to both sides to avoid having to ask for international assistance at any cost before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their trust in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the European sovereign debt market as a key player, judge that an extension of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance to be examined attentively in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are high.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
Snow events continue to cause traffic difficulties, particularly in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alert stage due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alert stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tang with the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snowcovers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic jams and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls for the drivers to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London, as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is remembered.
To guide the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to allocate a part of the financial sum on the markets to its double.
Today, it has finally come to the first calculations.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly Finance Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
First, Article 15 of the draft law is "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a reorganisation of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it, to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that contribute?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not included in the text.
Of the 4 billion, we are far away.
"It is being carried out that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment that will be spent by the state and will be gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e., R.), you can cover the project planning for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to list the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which the promised 4 billion will be able to be sought for a long time to come, runs the risk of provoking a rather lively, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and empathetic spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits throw nothing away beyond what you’ve been getting to read in every x-journal for months anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the horrifyingly caricatured profile Gaddafi has since offered cabaret artists.
The rule that the secret files can only consist of known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
As well as the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a lifting of the disclosures of these dossiers made?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned, with the exception of some small representational tasks, into spying.
Any viewers of investigative films know this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries the significant blow against the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims, than rather the "sharffrichter" in distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, all power could be bundled together like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you could control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can expose the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
True, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed to Clinton); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi’s or Merkel’s character is basically a secret free of secret, since it reveals the public sphere, but in the style of Wikiak, I have to admit that the secret is to be open to the public.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this outrage inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future - this would be like a sticker on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to be able to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved in an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how can private and ear-only relationships be maintained?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds science fiction and novel, but I see myself compelled to imagine government agents secretly moving empathetically on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in mere memory, and beyond, carrying little information with them.
The information would be stored in locked drawers in a single copy: basically, Watergate’s spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks’.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward like a cancer these days, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film band by band, by winding from the back to the front and venting all the secrets of the assembly, while today the (numerical) CDs allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is making good on its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-paced funding promises (also called "Fast Start" or early funding) implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French shipping companies have been uncovered.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU drew up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly valued for its actual value: developing countries and civil society like to see it when all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, setting it on track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be “new and additional” to ensure that an additional bet has been made without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that he considers to be the best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a benchmark for those of 2009: international financing is maintained, and gives 150 million over three years as part of the financing "Fast-Start".
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the funding for "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for spending in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> as equivalent to 1 donated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission control, which are based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, which is taken as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the donor country should be considered as an asset.
But France has nothing in mind other than the following consideration: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) – see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands a comparable bet.
Beautiful hokuspokus!
All in all, France is operating in its fast-start financing with a double blunder: on the one hand with a further development of the action over time and on the other with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let it go completely.
The chapter on early funding is just a small question for a relatively short period of time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Anyway, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of recording for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently debated topic): one does not escape the question of "accountability" or the way in which its loans are recorded.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “accountability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international confidence base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child takes in 81 different chemical substances over day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of analyzed samples do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent the illustrative nature of the treated problem", had, between July and September, the usual food consumed within four, from an approximately ten-year-old child to meals plus a snack in the supermarkets in Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water per day – have been studied as well as in-house workshops looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The plate balance is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if, in the approximate totality of the cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance individually ingested are not exceeded, it is well deduced from this survey that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-causing substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factor," he notes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and milk tea alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven to be carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
In addition, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spiked with the hacksteak, the tuna from the can.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unaffected.
The final risk of this “pollutant cocktail” to consumers “is likely to be underestimated,” the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, in turn, proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
