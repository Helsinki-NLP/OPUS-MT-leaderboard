The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakness of both parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), K<0xC3><0xA4>rnten’s deputy mayor J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing the triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections of 2006 it lost 5.5%.
Even worse was <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost by 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular ones, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage over SP<0xC3><0x96> in their preferences.
But voters have obviously punished them for scuttling the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the president of the party, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both the right-wing populist parties -the liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18% in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> won 11% of the votes - but the socio-democrats revealed at the same time the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the populars to the collective government, (then the BZ<0xC3><0x96> was still a motive of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>).
Haider obviously plays on this evolution, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the parliament, but it fell slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has obviously crossed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India May Cool Down
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally harvesting scarabs in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it did not resolve, then it would,that there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can hardly meddle in legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era sentenced to three years in prison, it would be better to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and charge these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
“I’ve made a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the Czech lawyer and division director, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the land
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
According to the UN Convention, they benefit from the laws they made an agreement on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
It has, according to the Convention, an exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
“In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very wide technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful,” Mikulka added.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine holdings, has registered a global echo.
But New Zealand has also earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, by about 1.6 square kilometers so roughly six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
Profit, which will bear them in the future from the seabed, as they promise, will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the area of the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.
No state now has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says director Mikulka exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc in the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extending between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is frayed, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the division of Macedonia, Rober Sandev, brings a piece of art with him to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
The circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 European hostages who were kidnapped are becoming increasingly clear.
German special units took part in the rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists were present on the spot the GSG9 units, the federal avian police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesman for the ministries said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there by luck," a spokesman for the interior ministry said.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on September 19: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the freedmen arrived in Cairo in good condition.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not elaborate on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 holidaymakers and special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aviation and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been stemmed.
In a dramatic action, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics of the $700 billion hefty package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to consent, although the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was going on, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investor concerns was that the state bailout package could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts are now expecting more severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the benefit of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of conjuncture, the desire to travel the Germans according to an investigation remains strong.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey by the market research institute GfK there are increased booking fees even for the autumn months.
Thus, the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
These results are based on the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and draws up statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would also be included.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, travel to the United States in particular would be required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly sought-after travel destinations for Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as localities within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive trips have a high price tag, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would have been a surplus in turnover again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip,compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, one litre mouthpiece beer and vip in branded Dirndln.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the suit/dress to this day is still limited.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, it’s not a big deal.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl gathers strange glances at the stand of the chocolate banana.
A nun points out that I would have tied the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind a widow."
Suddenly I put my bow from the back to the left.
“All right,” he says and laughs.
Others make less of a waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the back naked against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo".
This tells me, after he got rid of his bottle of beer from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a dumpster.
Bob is one of those infamous Wildbieslers.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m. on the square of the party the health workers, who have to take care of the poor drunks, walk in droves
The nurses appear every time in the herd – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered stretcher into the tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the tarp in this blood-alcohol-rate coffin, you can't see it.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitizers shouts to me and disappears into the baraonda.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on the charge of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what tour guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and Dominatrix forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly falling apart, far outpaced by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-greater diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jog along the tracks that produced the old-world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up shopping malls and power confectioners, where managers in business suites – both men and women – meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The foreign policy party’s goal now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has made in memory: the ties of not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically traverse those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions can now be, in large part, in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should advance claims on this fascinating country.
Lives Remembered: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21s under 21s, but by the time Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than 20s — we simply refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything that music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often was Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I’ve watched over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never disagreed with just one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated orchestra conductors who, in his words, simply "knitted around the world one or two well-known battlehorses".
So many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career is not known.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
"Resino captures magical moments."
Second assault for Honda oversold
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To everything must be added a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows to save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before proceeding to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Almost one million units of Jazz have been sold in Japan since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, managers for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz within a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .di to significantly reduce the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company expects to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company’s launch in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increase in size, it also expands the habitable interior.
This advantage comes from the introduction of a new platform on the one hand, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position on the other, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the boot – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the engine version 1.4, and that the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the ability to mount panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keep the engine torque high at all its stages.
The 1.2-litre model offers a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The drive – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous drive, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now there are 100 available.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "car bee" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of bees, for example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of the four-area Safety Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer's house.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important thing are the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, the engineers developed what they called a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects the obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If it weren’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, and not even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles in the path.
Trembling before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not devoid of ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing themselves to junk loans in banks with questionable insolvency, they created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credit"... or problems.
The dark aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It is more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, compare a song room inside the hotel.
It’s still something, because buying a better house doesn’t even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens up its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21 percent stake in the company, news received following a sharp decline in its stock market shares.
A week after a provisional deal was struck, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at an individual cost of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global transaction would be made on the basis of an average price of $29 per security, which is a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
By 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares by bringing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than they had previously taken.
The modalities set out on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for an amount of $8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: “We thought our shareholding would be composed exclusively of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its budget starting at the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of insurance against risks has suffered a surge.
However, the cost was high on Monday, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivors" among the major Wall Street investment banks following the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch discovery, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a crushing victory of "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night between Sunday and Monday.
The “Constitution has triumphed gloriously,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially of oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the freedom of health and education services, which the president began promoting in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also bans the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning, they had been liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base near Cairo International Airport around 15:30 on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hideout to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organizing agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, just before dawn.
"There have been shootings, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled," the official said, who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit “lampo” were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of the Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4<0xC3><0x97>4 vehicle on which the hijackers were stationed and to have killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two of them.
According to the army, the hijackers would be linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters – The Silent Majority of Culture
On the first page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current electoral campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the small sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic places that are hungry?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, grouped into 211 societies for the protection of historical, genealogical, archival and heritage heritage, are at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, with four funds, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are partially nationalising the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to face the crisis of the US credit market: the three countries will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion to the financial-insurance institution with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of Fortis, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the share of the bank present in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, Fortis' actions began with a vertical collapse, with serious signs of a crisis in the institute in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, its lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The corporate summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly picked up.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought out private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had previously ensured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken to the fox” – writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the drugs.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of damage to the health of any customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not take out insurance.
Long ago, the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the exam.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure 10 years ago: based on the customer’s identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines you have purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program shows what diseases you suffer and in what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is practically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, the insurer so in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Contraindications include that some medications can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance - commercial point of view, is worth as a risk increase factor, the first two do not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, request the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities force them to do so even if they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have recently also processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time control of usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: for this reason, he has developed a program that links the forwarding of data with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Given that the European Union and India are trading partners above all, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting has also been dominated by this issue, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal first of all with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a great democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member states have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no emphasis on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in his capacity as EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they reached an agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. increase trade to 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it is continuing its energy and climate programme, which is expected to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that it would be necessary to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros.
According to our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by the press meeting at Room Struktrukt in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors gradually decreases on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane found by billionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert.
The debris was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
"The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly the one on which Steve Fossett was flying the day he disappeared," Anderson said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) said a team of investigators was dispatched a few hours after the wreck sighting, which then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off for a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal belongings had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primaries.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original design and well defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and clean corners.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the offroad "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a breath of newness in this field.
Just for its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affixions, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic view and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture you will have the impression that the car comes out of the manifest.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
With this formula, will it manage to captivate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National for years and that until now, in truth, had never created excessive problems.
He had never been in a fight with his opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia have been added groupspusculi (few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the militants' cities of origin appear: on Saturday night they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue-collar fans, who had a history of stage crimes, had been denied the ticket and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Lucky for you.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
“We need to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” they argue from the Viminale.
So, "well-open eyes especially in view of Wednesday's game of the National team in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with the stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm extended during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was previously of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been a Quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to ingratiate the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - adds the Observatory no. 1 - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will assess for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistles in the hymn of Mameli: even those are not crimes, but if you allow me they are not education...".
