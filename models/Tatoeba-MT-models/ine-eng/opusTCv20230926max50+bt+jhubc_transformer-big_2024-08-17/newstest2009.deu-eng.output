The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the minus against closing.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange started trading at the beginning of Tuesday’s trades on Monday, when it fell another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the burglary was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
Shares on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock market fell by 3.6 per cent, according to the index.
"The timing of the rescue in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," Hong Kong's chief monetary officer Joseph Yam said in a statement.
Hong Kong, although belonging to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries are likely to be affected by the collapse.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK) should be spent.
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the biggest plunge in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell nearly seven percent, a similar decline it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Admits U.S. Government May Pump $700 Billion Into Banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks to pass a rescue plan in the form of financial aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this is not yet a victory.
Congressional representatives still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various reports, the plan could probably be voted on in the Senate at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "disenchantment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could also help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets by financial companies, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We have to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we are on target,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also striking in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors about deals in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congressional decision could affect the deals on Monday.
However, it is not yet entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is uncertainty about whether the negotiations could still fail at the last minute on a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will see some changes.
The total amount allocated to aid the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
Congress can, however, block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president has a veto right in this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, which was based on obtaining funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We have worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and “appreciate the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding benefits, and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be led by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard and made great progress toward an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who are having trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the goal being to lower the monthly cost to the debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and approve it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be an adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek said.
Duel on knife's edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make phone calls.
So, of course, it looks like it is better to just buy a phone.
After all, there are plenty of reasons why you should hire an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Surely it is difficult to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on the go, i.e. with compressed music, in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly be able to afford headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even create hints.
No modern device is as universal to use as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephony and sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and maybe even navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you still call from time to time, you’d better buy a charger for the office for safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a one-time charge.
Another problem is if you want to overplay the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can play the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers are finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software, except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to power the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When choosing a specific device, you should ask yourself in particular about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also about the ease of use.
If your music is mostly behind the scenes and you only hear it for a short time every day, for example, in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
This is something that almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be right in that format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a powerful argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is lying at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost any phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that no normal headphones are present.
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player in turn lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrifying bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now?
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But beware.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The biggest one is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) provide you MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe he won’t be able to wait much longer.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile service providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are the prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fighting fantasy.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile phone providers, on the other hand, like to scoff at the fact that there is an enormous amount of competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, is also often obliged to do so.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way, he would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market that brought about a significant price reduction, which then also the classic mobile providers had to respond to.
Prior to the launch of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you do not need to look for examples for long.
In February this year, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not require a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually turn out to be low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could take hold in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, mobile phone providers say
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to prevent a potential competitor from emerging.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe there will be better times.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in rare agreement with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
And she adds: “T-Mobile’s network will hardly feature a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer in order to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The approach of the mobile service providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was coming from the company T-Mobile when U:fon came on the market.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now, U:fon is a good argument for why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> noted: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile carrier.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is the sole proprietor of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not of sufficient interest to the classical providers", Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS said in his response to our request.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
This is more than a concern of an authority that represents the interests of consumers and is intended, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is really shocking in this case is the almost already touching harmony of the three mobile service providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely same price of petrol at the petrol stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not detected any evidence in this case that suggests anti-competitive conduct and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he also does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions in the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile service providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - for its network the monopoly.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
But even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile service providers act remarkably similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The shift of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> failed to enforce the extension of its competences to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS only need to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if no one's watching
The first thing that remains unnoticed is the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile carriers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms that we will then deal with, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not resonate with the managers of the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, the activities of these companies give them not to be neglected profits, at the same time they - unlike the actual virtual providers - are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all this, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full access to it like the regular customers of the mobile service providers."
That alone, however, should at least seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>TU.
There is also another question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
The mobile phone providers close their eyes before such an approach, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences for the detection of such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the providers, they would not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers has brought a significant decrease in the price of the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which in no way tried to safeguard the interests of mobile phone providers, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal printing, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But we do not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is soon to appear, the Czech mobile market may soon set in motion again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminatory) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will not be able to make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where Is My Homeland on the occasion of Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful.
Earlier, he had told the Czech Radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that there is harmony," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j was first sung in 1834 on the stage of the St<0xC3><0xA4>ndetheater in the originally Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, the music coming from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people accepted it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "New" Hymn?
The Prague transport companies also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which the first passengers to enter a subway, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the same time, in the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Ratylysany, Letryby, Ratylysany.
The coupons have also been available on the Internet since yesterday on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, this is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, there is also a switch with trained staff available to advise interested parties on the purchase of the Internet and also to put the coupon on the card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service vending machines on the open card, which are mounted in some subway vestibuls.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket depreciators, the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants of municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"On trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables for Prague's transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout with the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked position on the side of the cash register.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not travel by suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires can in turn go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten called on the United States to make a popular decision
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, several groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US president.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken over by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators,” it said in a letter signed with the words “people who are at the heart of the fate of the Sudeten.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President, to overcome the rule of protection for today and forever.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state for us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed absolutely nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a popular decision in the Bohemian Forestgau about whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today's knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had at least to suspect that they would be negotiating their expulsion from the republic, few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He served as a German Budweiser in the Baltic Sea Navy during the war.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech language would suit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don't think so, then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at motorists
The most expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to take away drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to drive drivers away from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to strap themselves before boarding.
The campaign aims to make young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional motorists aware.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don't think so, then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a bloodbath there is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is quite normal to see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for motorists
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that if you drive at red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," says traffic psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n of Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective, in his opinion, are boards that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you put up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be made in return.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He conceded that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work,” he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians know all too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the ongoing support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terror network and the jihad (Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a student agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth while on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The crash, which killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the truck driver crossing the road.
The young woman was sitting at that moment to all misfortune next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she still had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply, in which the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role if the bus is equipped with parking spaces after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency do not have standing places; as the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not initially agree with the movement of travellers.
This was later withdrawn, and we have reached a consensus that travellers are allowed to go to the toilet while travelling if they have their seat,” he said.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport knows only the term vehicle attendant; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," added the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety specialist Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid mode of driving, not many dangers threaten, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess may bump her head."
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company providing services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
“As soon as I get the impression that the steward’s profession is risky, I will strike him down.
Coffee and newspapers are available to guests upon arrival.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin’s interest in security is due to the lack of stewards on his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been fighting back from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the society for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent down without blinking from the standing strip and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court verdict, but also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation, on which a thirty-man team of experts of the Ministry of Transport is already working for over a year.
“However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says specialist Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of the travelers," said Hanzelka, with control of the safety of the buses falling within the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the WestLB Board’s letter to the staff of the house is not lacking.
By merging units of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt-based Deka Bank, “the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group” could be created, the letter published on Monday said.
WestLB incorporated a “competence block” with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundlings in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the battered WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear, the time has come to find a solution for the future.
As always, there is a connection between the Deka Bank, which is known to Sparkassen customers because of its investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although, at the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, deka bank chief Franz Waas made it known that he saw no sense in a merger of the house on Mainz Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and the Savings Bank Associations, has instructed the Board to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the talks have only just begun, as they say at the financial centre.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came out of this triple bond.
The plans had barely become public, the Hessian state government said against the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about a connection between the Deka bank and Landesbanken.
Recently, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a contraction of the various houses of the public-law sector is a necessity.
After the state election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could become the first.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
Should the pressure on further mergers increase, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, even though she has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A merger with West LB in turn, the savings and Giroverband Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen, which participates in the Helaba with 85 percent, has put forward a barrier at the beginning of the year.
Stay in the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question as to which business model should ensure the future viability of Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is, of course, not desirable there.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors there is also talking about it, it is certainly aimed at a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the merging of individual units with the deka bank will still be shown.
The second Wiesn weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massive bearded man and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses will start this evening at 11.45 p.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver bows, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, at 10.30 pm back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the motorway direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates stop at Autobahn 8 just before Munich.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put the yellow cap on.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reiseb<0xC3><0xBC>ro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, in the room distribute!"
The measure, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tips.
"The security people show that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight, point half-past eleven here again!" Got it?
And now we're going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap ties as a road sign to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for withdrawal.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There is no exact information on the numbers; the figure is 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have arrived extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 deployments) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular with Italians is the farm brook tent.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also interferes that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-like developments.
It has now arrived on the weekend.
The Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to interest the part that they also claim.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses to the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects, the state financier had refinanced himself in the extremely short term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the prior-year period, while income from amortizations of receivables and certain securities and from the resolution of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements of subsequent settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regime and from the business supply for group companies, the revenue decrease had still been moderate with around 16 percent.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been segregated in Aareal Bank.
Because of the lack of profit in classical state financing, Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
At the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss accounts of the group, it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market than other institutions because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely lagging behind, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance part of the Depfa loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros per year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets”.
From other sources, it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt f<0xC3><0xBC>r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is something that shareholders and creditors of the bank can hope for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is even not inconceivable that the funding need not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite is also not to be worn out.
After the bank was still before the insolvency hearing on late Sunday evening, even the at least provisional rescue was unable to calm the minds.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices hold up quite well.
If the priority debts are barely moving, the rates of the subordinated bonds will fall more significantly.
In particular, the bonds of the former W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo subsidiary are affected and, of course, the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds were previously a speculative investment alternative, then their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant tightening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be abolished on time.
Or there is something that hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports of partial nationalization, the probability of bordering on security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
After all, short-term investors can use a closing line to form a loss presentation for future repayment tax payments on exchange rate gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to pee: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from mangas - in the new exchange-log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had a hangover.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not run away.
The beginning of classes at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students trudge in from eight o'clock until at twenty before nine a short round of meetings begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on my host mother’s old skirt, plus blouses, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the counter and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a week birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all sneezed, sneezed and waved and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly moved into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stormed.
Everyone talked confused and chuckled and asked me about holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all unpacked their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me a lunchbox - this is something different from the empty German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat in tofu mantel.
Most of the time I don’t have a pale shimmer, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just for lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made Bento, which she then creates especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the break talk.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch it here too.
'Why Japan, then?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I’ve been reading my favorite manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So for me it was completely clear that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And you place great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here either, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
Does a rat or a raccoon flee in danger, that means it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same way if they behave similar to us?
In the Internet magazine " Edge" for several years, contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this until now where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to another species and address questions of sensation or consciousness in general, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it poses dead, flees or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be acquired, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of the special hardware, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my explanations relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens to the sensations?
I refer them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one’s own brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and especially humans.
Linked to the linguistic nature, fine gradations of the feeling result, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others in addition to ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio suggests that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem arise similarly to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in multi-genre sensations.
Theoretically, I can’t argue with that, but I think it’s unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way in both cases, but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same way if they behave similarly?
Does a scabies flee in danger if it also feels fear?
In my view, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stem cells, on the other hand, ravens do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to man: how would you prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even raccoons (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is indicated here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I explore sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think that’s short-sighted, but I’d rather get ahead than run against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa president Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the Euro 2012 will not suffer from this."
Several first-place finishers had been convicted of manipulative coercion last season alone, and even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Dennis Quaid is back.
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with former Hollywood star Meg Ryan outing her outcast Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He foams and beats back.
Late Rose War with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an ugly fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
It was only after the divorce that she learned about the extent of the fraud.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “Incredible,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly chews up and re-tightens the history of our relationship.”
It is also "deplorable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so close his admissions with the side lift: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices for air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant drop in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
Most clearly, the trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a “decreasing travel appetite of American tourists.”
Financial locations such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices hold the record in Europe, with an increase of 26.3%.
In terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Due to kerosene inflation, economy-class travelers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for the price drop is the sluggish economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market was sluggish.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes with airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein increase breakaway landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the cockpit of the Hamburger Arena.
There was a lot going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many of the outcast actors.
And so his request was heard at the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similarly: Here with Gate two!
The implementation remained.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) are due to Mladen Petric's header (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort that out," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the tabular interlude stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their late-committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goaltender Petric and the Jansen from FC Bayern - finds themselves slowly, but they are not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," Jol demanded.
After the voting defeat
There is fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock exchange barometer recorded a drop of around five percent at 10,579 counters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which dropped nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs declined by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett took part in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds will be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the amount should be paid out not at a glance, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed with appropriate price development to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the United States in a downward trend
Billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not resolve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the Dax down.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is losing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deeply affected the German Stock Index (Dax).
Despite the rescue action by the German government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s share temporarily lost three-quarters of its value, which Commerzbank dropped by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded a decrease of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to revive the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially dropped by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor declined after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been causing inadvertence: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite right.
Almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to soon-freezing fuel lines, you are now in danger of cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised by for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that made up astronomers in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously emanates from her an attractive force, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists Kidnapped in Egypt Are Free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were smuggled into Egypt are supposed to be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom money.
Six hostage-takers were reportedly killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Money-lender negotiations are already underway.
Time and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who were smuggled into the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports on Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It was "just about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six of the hijackers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The criminal court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her and blindfolded her before engaging in sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court learned, however, that Ms. Randle, who volunteered for the National Trust for much of her time, was being prosecuted for the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said Ms. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended up like this: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t force them sexually.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court had it not done so."
He added: "I take note of the impact, as described by Stephanie's father and mother, her deed over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was deputed by the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Department of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be mentioned, is charged according to paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause that deals with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor’s office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken by his house to a secret location.
B&B Costs to Consider
British housing companies could face costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), said it was “unbearable” that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing construction companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the property boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
“We will be looking at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing construction companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organizations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price hike this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations were conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused bail for the charge of extorting 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her unrestricted freedom at first.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted in order to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to remain on her own when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s decision.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail plea because it says she does not need to be granted bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers are appealing that they need bail to return to the country from abroad in order to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17, an Awami alliance party leader said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or impede the thousands of staff who carry out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV channel.
The Court of Appeal has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB’s share distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the share in ITV raised doubts about the ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Office have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, particularly because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice system.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to compel witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the Democratic election fraud allegations.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was fired and eventually resigned his post.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report criticised Gonzales’s role in carrying the “principal responsibility” for the dismissals, “giving up” his leadership role and showing himself “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's Epic Song to be Honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for its epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold award during the ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" tops the nominations for this year's awards after coming into narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, Paul Rees, said there were some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre, and “Bat Out Of Hell” was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s “Bat Out Of Hell” has spent about nine years on the charts and has sold more than 40 million worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to an irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat infection.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main thoroughfares, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others just comfortable.
However, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repaint Extra Place to create a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it’s fascinated by the short alley, simply because it’s one of the remnants of the block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair the road and operate what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it will be renovating the small street and renovating seats that are intended for a café, among other things, to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road but did not necessarily want to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed lane and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city had proposed the sale itself.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood, The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic appeal.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of debris, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should continue to be public.
Others have hailed Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Grievances: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), has published part of the urban history talk about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters.”
With a few exceptions, the street looked just like it did last night.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of ransacked newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in Caliphonic Studies and Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s education proposals are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students” — which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among others, a bilingual transition phase in education for those who are just learning English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school achievement.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Yet in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth graders passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly the point Obama should pay attention to, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, said to me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learners?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s answer uncertain.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation that targets “English only.”
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider education models that work, rather than disparaging and trivializing them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and the powerful turmoil in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, then rose again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors again expressed concern, although congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is expected to buy up the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to a government statement on Monday.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the commodity markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The Bank’s analysts have downgraded their oil consumption expectations due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter set
Insider Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all after appearing more often than anyone else in the Jets jersey in the last eighteen-and-a-half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a triumph.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
After a muddy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't put much effort into it," Coles says of the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Outfielder Darrelle Revis caught an unlucky pitch and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then made a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets' coach, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Retired Gebrselassie breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to reach the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie improved his previous score from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of fear that the air pollution might worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distance, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had convulsions in his calf two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Obviously, after a break, he was refreshed and not roasted back.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rivals – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s top marathon stars in general, relying too heavily on race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the track in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the Tempomachers dropped out.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all time.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skilfully planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners tear up first, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outcrops of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three playgrounds, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city that describes it – and that made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida guidebook produced by the Federal Writers’ Project during the Depression – remains a place of very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “so little knows about us that he doesn’t know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
“We’re very concerned about how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city resident and parishioner of the city’s oldest church.
It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the lookout.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in oral form, such as Mules and Men (1953) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Bold as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Off the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-and-white-painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and what-also-always fits in class rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was definitely not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by citing the men singing songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something of her venerable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swayed in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books ran out.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big commemoration, no public readings in the grand style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 biography of Hurston.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality's slow two-lane highway.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to force integration, calling its decision in Brown’s case against the school board “offensive rather than respectful of my race.”
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group unity in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being hugged — I remember — they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group protecting the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You didn’t hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean there’s a cultural divide,” Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who have set themselves above prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, making it again a part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane long-distance road enlivened the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
More and more trainees came, as did Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the country's historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is now 90% black.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a permit is required in advance and certain things – such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men at field work – must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their screened community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, which he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to properly describe Eatonville.
“Most people who only go through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, we speak financial Latin fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even realize that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror work day since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea trolleys along sidewalks with loud claps and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still wander between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with the 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the global recession.
Although I had decided to place my compulsory course on time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already queued.
Not at the money counters to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for directions to Macy's department store, and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, I learned later from Starr, my “personal bank employee with license,” stood for the same reason I stood snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they were commuting, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had raised money from so-called Thriftys (a bit like a construction bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have gone silently and quietly bankrupt.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy management over and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings assets, looking for a saver.
In fear of another crash, the office and store employees in front of me brought their bar to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese tribal supermarket took reference to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and their disembodied CEO Dick Fuld with so much familiarity, as if she were slandering a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge at my block of flat, got away from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslim graves desecrated during right-wing skirmish in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing leader of Austria's right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of Belgium's right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the "Cities Against Islamization" organization.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of the grave breach in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at which extreme right-wing parties recorded significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were badly damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to disguise the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the burial, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan is coming to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even denounced his aversion to food, which is commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, saying that the extreme right is the most politically powerful bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after presenting evidence to the judges of Glitter’s convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning Law Firm.
A spokesman for the court said: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police applied to Ashford County Court for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the Register of Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A Kent Police Department spokeswoman said: "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
“It is the highest concern of the Kent Police to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might be posed to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to require him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I welcome the master behind the stage to capture his character', G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are alien to the audience, I know when I can find gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco’s Photography Month program, “reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is becoming more and more important from day to day,” explains the artist, and makes it clear that Flamenco-people can be anyone, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of it.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, one does not have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the characters of the greatest flamenco masters.
Bauer, inspired by the festival <0x60>Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that resemble classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: <0x60>music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character that seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as <0x60>portraits of the veterans of sport' (<0x60>SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the <0x60>Flamenco-people' project are different, the photographer gives to <0x60>I like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
The collection of portraits of the flamenco of today entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is “a folly”.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the Nobel Laureate admitted that the project he is engaged in is “a folly” and “everything indicates that he should not write the novel.”
<0x60>If I had considered it, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel at some point,' he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the premium of the Hay Festival and to whom most of the attendees give their voice, is compared with the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo, and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, and which arose out of <0x60>extraordinary evenings, readings'.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is <0x60>no way' to measure <0x60>anything else', and how to know if books change people's lives, <0x60>but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,' Vargas Llosa, who claims that they <0x60>produce' from the effects.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfights partly fell out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfight party, with which the party was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the organizer has decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus, the festival was exposed to the unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
There was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had done more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted with buh-calls in his second fight.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they didn’t have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police chased them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Basque State’s Interior Ministry reported.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the chase until the car stopped at the edge of the lane after a few kilometers, at which point the drivers got out of the car to escape to a forest area over a country road.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later routed to further police stations for precise laboratory analysis and to divert the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was <0x60>double', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the prison magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for her role as Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness watched her trying to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, a California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “after 16:30 pushed through the gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the witness, who had probably not recognized at first, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who alerted the emergency services because she was ‘afraid of living for Locklears’.
When the police raid came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the street, blocking traffic.
"They seemed to be disoriented," so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. <0xC2><0xAB>Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,» said the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance, which could not be determined, and taken to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, has today assured that the regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of listening to business with family.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for this,” Llamazares pointed out how the party must deal with the one who is currently on the Seville City Council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for “transparency” in the possible investigations of violations of the rules that Silva may have started: “The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency”.
With regard to this topic, he stressed that education has “a strict ethical code for all public offices”.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Hero's Book of Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci presents in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros invested for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to 'show off a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a great fan of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s literature, assures that thanks to this film work his <0x60>Childhood Dream' was fulfilled. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to shoot a commemorative film on the second century celebration on November 2nd in Madrid, mainly because of the National's dedication to the cause.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, offers Garci, as he added, the <0xC2><0xAB>one-time opportunity» with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of <0xC2><0xAB>confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight because the people had been standing in the struggle for independence and under the rule of the VIIth.
However, the Cineast regrets that the funding, as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), could not be counted on, so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a Empezar', has contributed through his usual way of working: he stands out on stage to the actors with whom one must first try to shoot and for those who had not made a casting, he appears to be 'humiliating' in the film industry, to be able to do what he sees in the film industry.
Many actors he encounters in Sangre de Mayo have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de Mayo' nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally <0x60>L’s filmego also not selected.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first, you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s only for growth, and now you’re happy if you’ve produced another film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional work.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and her mother was Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed to me this role, which seemed impossible to me.
“We’re not trying to tell her about her life without preserving her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance basics have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, the dance of the butterfly appeared to me like Guajira, or the dance of the snake like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I’ve been told that my dancing is in this aesthetic area as well,” she says.
The production is expected to feature two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will once again sing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he has done in <0x60>La puerta abrada'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0x60>takes on the role of the accompanying artist.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in such far-flung places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her because I think she is one of the women who has a tremendous influence on a particular era and whose works no one else can appreciate today, and therefore even less so,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recien casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recien casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the <0x60>triennium of the Zenobia' and the juan<0xC3><0xB3>n 2006 .
Thus, <0x60>the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia and with the Wandering Exhibition <0x60>Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and will be different in Newal.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The U.S. can't imagine anything without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in "Sensation Reporter," and from the then-dominant show of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthralling show and followed her.
Look at how much it cost to give him the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow to everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford said, crying, “my life and my country have been the greatest hustles of his life.”
No one was afraid of ridicule or exaggeration.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If only a few people remain in this hard time without virtue that you can admire, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it took a lot of effort to impose itself against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder hits home high over Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the entire era.
Sam Mendes, the film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or no less than the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of us all has left us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to live today as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He got divorced once and was married fifty years later to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal to, although there certainly were many ways not to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have Filet at home?’ he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of any of them as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my judgment, it was the worst street with everything around it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the review and I could check it out, something like this would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with getting the ticket, which allows you to go first.
I don’t think it’s bad either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chips to avoid traffic jams).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense, which consists in just going for it) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So well, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to pick up the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
After all, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, it looked like it was raining in those 40 minutes, so there was the temptation to organize a popular uprising and to invade the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even show up in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, I would never think of that street.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics for a long time to come.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, the system is a route planner to get around).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this <0x60>receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, <0x60>the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her, and that he is also not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and replies that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many programs involved.
Steve Ballmer noted that if computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only a finding when you consider that Microsoft added one or another function and <0x60>extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many people have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the <0x60>windows'.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt. I’ll give a small example of that.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshment vending machine is attached a sign: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso owned it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio owned this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola.
When we start to count the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English call it <0x60>tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called <0x60>Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend has it that the name is associated with sports and originated from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' stands out all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that have these t-shirts as detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only focus on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxers Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very attractive.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her large appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is delicate, but full of life joy.
Currently, the Gruz brothers take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important awards in fashion, which is sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this fall/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I have also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and attended the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women get dressed, how they combine their clothes, that’s what I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe so, but in the end, everything comes together in one and these areas have many similarities.
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s to crawl around in my aunt’s wardrobe and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role of an actor.
After all, everything is connected with each other, there is so much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Have you recently turned 30, have you not fallen into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever when I am 30 years old.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I will become a mother because my body demands it, and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry.
I will convey great feelings of happiness to my child and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works in which you participated and which were shot last year.
That is exactly the way it is, and I very much want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course can not be immediate.
I very much wish that <0x60>La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the treadmill with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It’s not like I went on the treadmill to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization <0x60>Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were auctioned to the same money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of stuff being told about them, and I, as the one who knows them, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who can become relapsed due to the alcohol level will have to install the <0x60>Alcolock'.
The authorities order that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Attorney General’s report, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the retraining of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol returned to driving.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car starting when the driver has done an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is found to be higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action on this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without <0x60>peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México DF landed the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, traveling with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced the hand to use as an umbrella to see the royal couple who got off the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, since you can't take people to the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, yeah, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give the honorary ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-wound hair, without ordinary ‘peep-toes’, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official follow-up is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that are connected to the fact that you want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, is torn apart. He has put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has Valentino at Dinner's.
Andik, the owner and lord of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a gentleman that he ended up with the Baron of Rothschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, hastened to the business and had a trousers and a shirt on which she modelled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, plied a stan .
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed linen and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There are not 1,000, but one more way to forget chaotic, fast-paced everyday life.
And although there are few, they are all collected in a book, in which it says how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes proposed that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body’s balance and the stress has become a problem, then the time has come to sit on the couch, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it does not matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder, which is called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can not remember anything.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, enuresis noctura (sleep-wetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned before, it can be very high fiber, stressful situations or overwork.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak calmly in single words, whisper or it may be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and thus occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to excite the child before going to sleep.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children who are advised to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep peacefully.
If talking happens in your sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advices
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will take it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be anxious after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to get advice or find out what reason the child has for the anxiety.
When they understand what it is saying (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can not think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams of and why it says that, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhausen ... at last
After a long stretch of thirst, Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern on the pitch is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks took numerous chances and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot passed just at the angle, Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern should easily dominate the game, and it was alternately managed first fonderflick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with initially two chances scored by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately after that with the first goal for the Illh<0xC3><0xA4>user by Marais, who was just right to take back a ball that had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-fated goalie should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, as a result of which his teammates had to continue playing numerically inferior.
However, Denmark did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an ill-fated elf, who withdrew only a little to ‘compress’ their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the resolute attitude of the fishermen, who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’ and hope that he would come up with ‘concrete suggestions’.
The president’s visit comes at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led the Morbihan and Calvado protest marches, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
Already on Monday, sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d’Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue because the fishermen will not give up at any point and will not go to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman The Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid has died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and even Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is keeping its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Frederico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider handing over more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets, in order to repay the $85 billion that was allocated to it.
AIG is prepared to drive the sale of much of its business beyond its life insurance at the international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG may be divesting from are its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over $85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, including the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks, a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never-before-seen loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final shot figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was supposed to allow some stability in the markets again, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MPs refused to grant Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is a bad picture that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would be "too late."
“If the project is actually doomed to failure, it will quickly be the job of the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, emphasizing even more the sense of extreme urgency, that “every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial company” in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking operations by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” FTN Financial’s analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
Revenues from the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632 percent to 3.827 percent, and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161 percent to 4.357 percent.
Obama, winner after points in the first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs elected both Republicans and Democrats to their own victory in this television duel, which was to be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although quite handsome, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to halt his decline in election polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday that Obama said was five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
In the still undecided voters, that is, those who matter now, Obama emerged with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,’ but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy in the spotlight, while clearly underlining his opponent’s “naiveness” with regard to these issues that were at the heart of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he said several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election ads since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without letting himself be taken out of the frame.
He put his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
"McCain still doesn't understand, Obama already," a Democratic campaigner this weekend said, accusing Republicans of failing to capture the full extent of the crisis that is plaguing the "American off the street."
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election rally in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most suited to saving the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
After re-emphasizing that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, is a top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully evade the questions posed to the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition leaders demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the market square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: “The dictator should resign.”
Some admit that they didn’t even vote at all: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice,’ says a young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the recount," Juri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, said in a statement.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive.
When opposition MPs move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore obliged to intervene in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the electoral process, will not recognise the election as valid.
She stresses that the voter turnout appears to be too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling station.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are most likely to conform to the government’s ideas.”
The silence of the night descends again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public trust, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, during the 1980s, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donor Service were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and at developing guidelines to prevent a re-catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time, whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood canned food in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to reports from Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec took up their work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservation system in Quebec,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly emphasizing that by early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary is aware that <0x60>trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which you apply exclusionary measures if you do not know this and if a disease is only slowly progressing, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which results from a degeneration of the brain, which is inevitable.
So no blood was taken in April 1999 from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was without any doubt proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow to directly detect the presence of the virus in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and this could not be recognized, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone would be infected with HIV.
Because Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmission via a blood canister to occur.
I believe that you can feel comfortable with this nowadays if you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says the head of the board of directors of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We have to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to a safe supply.
“The demand is rising because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also affects the blood donation network, which on average only accounts for 3% of Quebec’s eligible residents.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent are excluded from blood donation for one year.
<0x60>With this 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep it and get it to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood canned but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being interspersed with Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, there is abundant blood in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,” continues Dr. Décary, who describes this umbilical cord blood loss program as very popular.
"Many mothers are convinced they don't have access to it," because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s impact qualified for the USL First League semi-finals with a 3-1 win (4-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second round yesterday and decide to play the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the pre- and back-game series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had a 2-1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to make up for a 3-1 deficit by a 4-3 win in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-finals with an overall goal ratio of 5-4.
Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by scoring the only goal of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He was too fixated on it in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest relies on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
<0x60>Displace the course of our last great frontier in the north': this is the long-term goal presented by Jean Charest yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines completely.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens were shot spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the election period.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he will hold the elections this autumn, even if he announced that his schedule is very full.
The <0x60>Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a <0x60>Vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a <0x60>New Economic Area' that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister’s speeches recently, the opening of the North – the northern area at the 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was a “jewel of enormous potential,” but did not specify a date, investment amounts or precise priorities for future projects.
At most, some prospects for what could be more worked on: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest’s list, the North possesses ‘nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds’.
This <0x60>Area twice as large as France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just around us, it’s inside us,’ he stressed, as if to clearly show that he’s trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told reporters.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity presents itself, I will take that position again on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the north,” he explained, speaking about the Northwest Passage, which will be traversable throughout the year due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would treat them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Soil Resources) occupies an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit”, but an occasion in which “one will create a common vision”.
Furthermore, the development of the North will be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
“The North Plan will be ‘discussed, regulated and environmentally sound,’” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were before him in office.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have been rethinking how to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
Incidentally, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program <0x60>Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
“This remains among us, but I intend to be there,” he confided to his party members, which was what came out of those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him from the law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of <0xC2><0xAB>constitutional goals», which were immediately adopted: the PLQ calls in particular for the recognition of the <0xC2><0xAB>Quebec peculiarity» in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council, and that they have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
From the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan Nord were adopted with skepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has revived the development policy of Nord-du-Québec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, “we would have gone much further today,” Ms. Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), judged Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken out in support of the government’s adoption of a North Plan.
“But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big show,” party leader Sébastien Proulx said, speaking on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Desecrated Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former 'Justice' minister (which irony) in Harper's cabinet, allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' to Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover it with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned that has not brought home its compatriot, who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were being accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to be vegetated there under inhumane conditions.
The only one who descends to a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are pleading for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that also closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that, after so many years, a young adult will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag, and which sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no longer any morality: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the best wishes of a head of government who is still supported only by the minority (may he be a minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they don’t see that this government has broken away from what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Free will - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and follows an Orwellian logic that the world’s largest gold-mining company sought a libel lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small, unfunded publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they are not judging the truth, especially not in the case of libel lawsuits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Incidentally, the tactic in these unequal battles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that makes the opposite side mouth off and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public.
Contrary to what is going and going in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas and not through knuckle-dragging.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent testing teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a handshake.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can ask for a ‘public’ debate at the same time, while ignoring the opinions of this public?
Apparently, in the vice president’s world, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a pretty narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public supporting the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the gold mine’s brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as grumbling (in the course of the <0x60>public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they refer to them).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of the world do not like, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to get hold of debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that limit this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of the deputies over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to limit the number of houses held due to payment arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Senator Judd Gregg, who attended the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on investors’ mood.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, showed themselves to be more in favor of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those that would allow the owners to keep their homes, and those that would affect the salaries of the executives of the state-saved companies.
“When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
<0x60>The guidelines I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared toward using taxpayers’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of extended bond (PCAA), and finally led to a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt at consensus last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of distressed societies should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the dead end.
To round out the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes to recover the capital it has invested.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by a re-vote of Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the aided companies, which pay him dividends in the event of winnings, and which it can resell once the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the seizure proceedings in respect of the dwellings linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get a green light.
In fact, yesterday there were more votes against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of asking the taxpayers to checkout.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called “the caucus of skeptics,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to inform us: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we again got the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are looming.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank that had been put in jeopardy by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with azure eyes was his trump card for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His subtlety, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema's golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the blast of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because he reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War in battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man's second in the 1979 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a show-off relationship.
With him also disappear the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and super-sensitive star to the glamour of the show business, whose riddles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put cinema lovers in a quagmire this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of constantly changing American film art is passing by with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind again, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter past memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There have been so many Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was meant for James Dean, was reprised after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
He's still here.
In his résumé, epochs unite.
The youth know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his splendour and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The job was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time just like that.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fiends or desperate, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his drifting and his revulsion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to this one, a work full of tenderness and sadness.
In the flood of honors that poured out on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift, is now also going.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was thought to be quite tasteless, although at first we still found it funny.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these phrases: <0x60>Always and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, negotiations in the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices begin.
The accused is accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including falsification of documents.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds lured from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly sent to the funds of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender money was received, and the associations are also said to have failed to comply with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were forged.
The bill blocks were bought at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was sent by J<0xC3><0xA1>no’s surcharge.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lado's pensions and restaurants should be found.
He demanded bills on consumption in order to later issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Budapest Self-Government.
These bills are said to have been manipulated by a majority of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, with the latter, according to our information, being responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer place.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuslag and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let association.
Now, however, the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the premises at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Job J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also revealed serious errors in form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, according to the bill, 130 guests have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters had apparently no limits when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company in whose accounting documents of the clients Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As managing director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he immediately realized that these were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And further: apart from form errors, the fact that the operation is said to have accommodated a hundred people was also wrong, after they had a total of eleven rooms, which impossible to accommodate so many people.
Food was also mentioned on the bill, while the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The empathetic counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offered travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as was known in the course of the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Revf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, because instead of 25 only 15 percent VAT is charged, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "invoicing agents" was that in one case they had indicated "transportation of goods" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office said.
Other formal errors - incorrect invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as to XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont could be exposed as fakes.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, whose managers insisted that they never issued the invoices.
Another "error" has been committed by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: This company was in disarray at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let is said to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they had to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, the Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation has issued invoices for the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with surcharges and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have taken over the foundation Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 Mio.
However, there was also little payment, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the persons concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., a Budapest-based but undetectable fuel and vehicle trading company.
In the period from October to December 2005, this company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components with a total value of HUF approximately 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, the liquidated Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas since 14 September 2005 is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov confessed to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> associations, as well as to Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and to having cashed their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers at the express request of Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov.
However, in truth, none of these companies were active, which according to the accused was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the auction, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices worth a total of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have cashed 10% of the invoice sum as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were closed to Biztos Pont's applications.
In January 2006, the company Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for other purposes.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA from Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to make a confession about the procedure of forgery of invoices, as they were already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos's plea to a full confession is decided.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession still stands.
The question remains, therefore, whether it is in his interest to do so, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the great part of the damage incurred by HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge in return is ready to assume responsibility.
It is, however, quite possible that the "offender" will now be charged with bribery after his requests for the easing of imprisonment and house arrest have been met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater harm with economic crimes and have not compensated for them are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, the possibility of a bribe remains denied.
The Psychology of Overselling – or Why We’re Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate what is offered.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore ready to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play lotto, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which overcoming the opponent plays a significant role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group also conducted research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerge as the winner of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis in one group was on winning, while in the other group it was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing "against loss" were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or "profit" group.
"These results cannot be inferred from any previous economic theory.
This is because they have so far only justified the behaviour observed in auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we have now prepared a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at hundreds of thousands in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, secretion or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to get a vaccine against the A and B viruses anyway, there is no vaccine against the C virus.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the much more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoo artists.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the GP at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which eliminates the risk of infection and prevents the formation of cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do Believers Have Less Pain?
As recent research shows, religious belief acts as a kind of “painkiller” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent belief in God affects people’s feelings of pain, the British newspaper “Telegraph” reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off most of the pain.
Using brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, the subjects were connected to the left hand with a sparkling device, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand an image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would evoke a kind of religious trance while choosing da Vinci’s image because it was hardly different from the other painting and was felt to be reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were to watch either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" in the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for", and they felt "rest and peace".
While looking at the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that one could produce similar effects with other, powerful images also among atheists, one just had to find the corresponding photo.
“We would have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases,” Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you communicate about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can assert with fugue and right: she can be found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their vacation, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he points out that these would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in the world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search history and later to resort to it, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system can use customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data breach - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that makes fear excitable, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the aversion to the power that many Internet users encounter on rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties on occasion, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of paedophilia.
However, users who were concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully sued the FBI: according to this, Google can not be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request in the future with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Jugendschutzgesetz (Jugendschutzgesetz), which was passed years ago, but it has been deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search term list, retroactively for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who don’t like to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy through the use of Google services are teasing the company with the indignation due to the companies that are conservatively portraying themselves.
However, the American “geek culture” that is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is a market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes for its users, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that has come to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teen can simultaneously manage their profile on multiple community portals – from Facebook to Shanghai, they can connect it through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and can eventually incorporate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which can also lead to new Flicks.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has had fun with, or the employee is fired because in his blog he is only too honest about his anger over the management of the company - one thing is for sure: the term "private" has been coined.
Who leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - so roughly one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can gladly do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no trace.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not found, but also Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly introduced services provide not only Microsoft, but also other copywriters.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing opposites: For example, the group management has been very good at rejecting a protest of the employees against the government, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, also the management thought that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could be quite powerfully reframed: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking on so much weight that it is almost impossible for the company to do so.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already supplies the next generation of sci-fi authors with the stuff — like “Scroogled,” Cory Doctorow’s famous novel best describes a future in Orwellian fashion in which a person becomes frighteningly close to Google-related data.
Two young men help <0xC3><0x93>zd's double-murderer to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two youths who are suspected of helping to remove the traces, the spokesman of the police commissariat Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were rebellious and are currently being accused of aiding them.
According to the news agency MTI, these are two girls who are defending themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old resident, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of intentionally murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a plot in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Announces Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange’s share packages.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchanges.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports in the Czech daily "E15", Poland's offer includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
So far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke of the “second 11 September” on Tuesday.
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said “La Repubblica” – the president has not even been able to get his own party behind the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the “El Mundo”, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva "Days indicator".
While some states could still provide bailouts to their shaky financial institutions, banks could save taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was paid out to debilitating financial institutions, the Vienna-based “Der Standard” recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers will now also have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
Although the "savers" would not have to "wander" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note, in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummus
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln to create new accident avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the autorobot-controlled biomimetic system BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval “private area,” which is very similar to our own “shield,” Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The bee’s compound eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the autorobot wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autorobot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer that is currently considered unavoidable within accidents.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, unlike the bees, the deflection can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking, of the autorobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not have to store them, or use previous maneuvers to produce an intuitive, logical response, so that it continuously requires only a handful of KB of memory.
It does not require any gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinner Child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a session that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, congressional deputies, after several days of debates, have pushed through to an agreement on the $ 700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, and said the agreement only needs to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will have an impact and it will be efficient, but we have to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time on Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday at 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-altitude flight on the exchanges.
On Monday, first the House of Representatives votes on the bill to stabilize the economy of 2008, then it is the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion be spent on the purchase of lazi, loan-laden securities at once.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion is to be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday, which is to be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and the president is to decide on the other $100 billion.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-charged securities, or other “toxic” loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern, and the companies pay the fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.”
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it has been signed, according to Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks, which are in trouble and are now dependent on state aid, can count on the government to cut short their payments, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang salopp.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the defunct banker is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that the manager’s salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in manager salaries are regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the saved bank are better off.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years to get taxpayers back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect of us, the plan doesn’t protect taxpayers’ money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were pushed forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
According to the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% year-on-year.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices are only slightly higher than in the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also risen only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) – primarily for bags and belts – where the increase was 4.6 percent, and for shoes, prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed up prices for chemicals and production significantly (1.6 percent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained the same.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily due to the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the previous year, crude oil prices increased the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price declines were observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The level of cost in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in the asset sector in August.
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sector they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 per cent) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, while in the investment goods, a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, 7.1 per cent against the dollar, and by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar in August 2007.
No more visas to the U.S. from 2009?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees good chances for the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement to come into force around January 12, as the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her opinion, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in a timely manner."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
She meets with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with Democratic foreign policy advisers Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials, after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning, announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain’s high, which gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has melted away at the same time.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We need to act now, and that’s responsible ... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened,” he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time squeezing it out ... but doing nothing is definitely not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also mandates the setting up of a control commission for the Treasury Secretary, as well as restricting clearances for top managers — something he has insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press show of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took office.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break-up of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something ended, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell by 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in the federal state has, at the end of the day, destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time greatly appreciated the pace. However, without impact, the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria to the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that in recent weeks, almost the classical civic groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with degrees such as university degrees.
Support for the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctantly in coalition issues" article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens have not yet decided on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have turned down the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, on the other hand, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in the coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> chief J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which is being hosted by the EU Council Presidency of France, began.
In her speech to the plenary, Ms L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP of the European People’s Party, drew attention, in particular, to educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and this is the biggest obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the job search, the Roma would be displaced primarily due to their low level of education from the labor market.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have a middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a university degree."
Furthermore, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economies of EU Member States.
In the opinion of the MEPs, it is important that these relations become aware of as wide a circle as possible - that is to say, Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more likely he or she is to become a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped" - says L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the honourable Member has said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, and the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully-fledged citizens," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral debacle, there are no heads at the moment, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in office, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
But the highly trained duo has already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their chairs.
They want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the “Bayern tsunami” in the face of the loss of the absolute majority, demanded personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the sole government in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructuring of the party, the potential successor Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will hold exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "Free Voters" those Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first took advantage of, and then mercilessly serve the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far pulled the strings from the background, will take an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitter day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which also contributed much to the success at the national level in 2005, not be put back on its feet with a common act of force, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and yet the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6%, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition managed to enter the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are violations of the law in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million-strong state of the population has been coming out for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the opposing party gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who was already "in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment, would resign his presidency in 2006.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. For the relief of price increases, loans have even been taken up, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the EU, the opposition was anti-Ukrainian, so the hope was raised with the opposition.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided for a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign as early as Monday - according to which opposition figures are not expected to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the absconding Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which the Ukrainians independently
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but still I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the elderly," Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners is a social one.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security', reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery, begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the election as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, not words". The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those slugs that first stamp and then go on coffee drinks during working hours.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Law" was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
"Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism,” Brunetta emphasizes once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: “The choice of the revolving doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Higher Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that "within three months the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with numbers of lower absenteeism at work - as the Consumer Center writes - the people of the 'active idleness' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; thus, the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contra gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the number of fatal accidents at work was around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as are caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention is in the workplace," President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of the injured workers, to aid for the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"An outraged 'Basta' has risen on this; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, cause some turbulence in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in the school environment of the young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness; a legislative standard must be put in place and improved.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths forms an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards determined rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
“The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention. That's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think you're basically doing too little to face the phenomenon of accidents, and you can fight against it through various actions?
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting at school.”
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and raising awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is required.”
Mercandelli also called for "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of work accidents" and called for the "abolition of the social system that we have been fighting against in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return a guarantee to the worker on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator".
Mp3 Player Under Charge: Risk of Hearing Damage
Hearing loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csserseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report released today in Brussels.
According to the report, 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than an hour a day are at risk of permanent hearing loss.
“I’m concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irreparably damage their hearing without knowing it,” Kuneva said.
"From the scientific findings - this is what the EU says - there is a clear risk that pushes for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology.”
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists - the EU Communication concludes - confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices".
There is already a European standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB at the moment, worrying about the damage that could come from an excessive noise load.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise setting are resorted to.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that when users of portable music devices only listen to loud music (no more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply with respect to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk a complete hearing loss within five years.
This represents 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno kicks off the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, it is supposed to be over in March, in June the balance will be drawn.
This is the procedure laid down by the Chapter for the work of the 'Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome', which met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Thermal Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City and City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," stresses Alemanno. "It will come up with proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders will remain the city and municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved, as such a project must have a time-bound end point.
In June, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
To those who question the Commission's competence because their views on liability are lacking, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, they deliver high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in view, in order to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city.”
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think, it will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, who "will not only confine himself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who owes much to being considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy through his decisions and maintained (and continues to do so as a private man) relations with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which until recently was kept hidden.
“Say what you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to do our crutches for, whether it’s for Obama or McCain.”
There are people out there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 troops in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the competent authorities.
They don’t feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are due to the cuts made by the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today satisfies the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and press executives believe that journalism is on the wrong track at the national level.
In the local area, the number of executives is even at 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the newsroom’s editors-in-chief and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at the national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years account for 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. ed.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often get very high salaries, but the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing gets complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often become “ill” over the course of the year.
It is a climate issue.
UNIPOL: DIRECTLY IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola due to bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a duty to stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor’s office had spoken out) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: A large portion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis is gradually tearing apart the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world in the south.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond, will be affected by these.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events that, under these new conditions, are finally taking shape and coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: namely, how to behave towards the affected families, who are also a huge mass of voters.
So the crisis appears to be global in economic terms, but it is almost purely national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into disrepute and lost its right to speak: the obvious evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two not-to-be-overvalued conditions – under certain circumstances – that no other international organization and no market will be able to use in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been attached to a sector most closely related to the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, just now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked realm, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we must at once see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is preferable to another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short push in.
He who says territory, he who says government, he who says politics, he also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a profound and, in a sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large sections of the population is paving the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is presented to the majority as ever stranger and superior.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and of the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseeable "revolts" of the voters and in the unmediated upheaval of the collective state of mind of recent times: beginning with the conservatism in Austria and ending with the rise of the Bavarians.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is being pushed from the financial crisis to the financial crisis.
In view of all this, it would be simply excessive to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now seemingly almost reached its goal.
Using an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers were able to fix a 100 kg body to a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged to a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "makes it easy to remove from the wall," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the field of space travel.
For now, the superheroes will have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, clean themselves from the dust by moving on a surface, thus always maintaining a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness especially in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: it is enough to drink a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice so that patients will be able to consume it.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mix, and emphasizes paying attention to what is drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or methadone.
IT’S NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial in the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received quite a bit of controversy in response and was presented to the economist years later, but today turns out to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a “very aggressive style analyst, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office, the Open Source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now spartan designed start menu, is finally a fundamentally guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x version, as well as the support for the new format 1.
Attention was also paid to the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, facilitates sending via email. This also includes the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, it is now also possible to generate "hybrid" PDF files, which expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be edited multiple-handedly by different users, avoiding conflicts with changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a frank to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are just about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result is expected to be made public.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or office.
However, freedom of the press can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, so it is precisely in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed the great throw: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, to create presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more well-known access; and lastly, Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Coal tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up within the framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is third-ranked and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to have tested positive for Cera, the third-generation epo, previously with Italians Riccardo Ricci<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the countersamples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed to the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME INTRODUCTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY Racist?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are admitted only with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, based on the case of young Burkina Faso native Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the “paradox of the north”: the northern regions are those where “most integration and job opportunities exist,” and yet “the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Northern League is to be found.”
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and to speed up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Victims of high rents of up to 900 euros per room
The housing market for students is not in crisis.
According to the latest study by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious moves. Quite a number of students are losing their right to study in practice, as their families are not able to support them at this level" - says the head of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the great demand from the students has led to a deformity of the market, which also affects the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers involve a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized subletting.
For the Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary measures, which, through a revision of taxation, lead to lower rental prices.
If we take a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the neighborhood of Brianza about 450 euros is needed; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the neighborhood of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the neighborhood of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the neighborhood of Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge outside can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: renting, which is 25-30% above average, is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long term the death of the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
Mostly historical places full of memories are affected, "it's like losing a friend, with whom you have traveled a piece of street full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which is lost forever in kinow.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this brand paid for the most part the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 it is both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all the preservation of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are ready to look for a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the missing state for the fund of the trade association remains outside attention: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed.
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears surrounding the old cinemas, has decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting the traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the peripheries.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax incentives for cinema operators as well as advantages for the public in relation to local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at a cheaper parking fee.
“It’s a pleasant initiative,” said Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will join our example and also come up with new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Prosecutor’s Office against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, were also taken in handcuffs: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan's boss, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia, at the time for a sum of 10 million euros.
"Disrespecting any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the mafia group - according to the judges - to invade the city halls officially and to co-determine the policy of the public administration."
The president of the Regional Committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "anything but an exception is to encounter connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep a white vest."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as the head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 by-election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He insisted that Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he considered to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an interception action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, there has been a willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the actions of the public administration identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy springs from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a non-delaying source of money, covering over 70% of the planet’s surface, and only now do the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not by chance these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energies generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also the currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, which in 2005 signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now focusing on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and considering the possibility of working with us.”
This is about obtaining an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the US in Alaska, and President Bush only recently initiated plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Yet more improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects like the one in Portugal and Scotland are rather small in size and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with a far greater impact on the environment.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via subsea lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for the state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Generation Research, a particular interest immediately deserves the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, the solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to $35 million is already planned for 2009.
