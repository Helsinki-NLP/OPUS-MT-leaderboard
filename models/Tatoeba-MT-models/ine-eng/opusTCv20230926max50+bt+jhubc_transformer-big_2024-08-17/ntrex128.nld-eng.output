Members of the National Assembly of Wales worry they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
Members of the National Assembly of Wales are shaken by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is appearing ridiculously.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP “remains on Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Plaid party’s National Assembly of Wales said the group as a whole is “unsatisfied” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The National Assembly of Wales Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who are taking the final decision on their new title.”
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus, and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a tense dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are silent, those of Harlem are having a hard time
“The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a café and a church here on every corner,” Mr Adams said.
Today there is no café or church to be found here.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
“Cafes are no longer the neighborhood’s living room, where people regularly walk by.”
He worries, however, that the proceeds from the sale of the church’s assets will go on for less time than leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’ll be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won’t help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Eerwaarde Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beaver.
Venerable David Johnson, the son of Venerable Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin’s, proudly called the beaver “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the beaver in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beaver ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beaver of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese “would like to pass on the costs” to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Who Died of Crabs in California
Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California. The boy sustained injuries, it said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was calling because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘that the boy was calling: ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His key bone was completely open,” Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which shark is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded at the time that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove successful, they will be inducted into even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also bringing its Boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will be testing the Fragrance Shop concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the former opening in Croydon, south London, the latter opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, sales of food have increased as a result and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of pharmacy revenue in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy units in stores three years ago for an amount of 125 million pounds to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the design of our beauty department to make it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop the old way.'
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "angry" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones and Willoughby’s company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby for retiring from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “angry” when Willoughby on Tuesday, during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts (worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) did not leave enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would be leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would secure her long-term future, and deliver enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is full of products that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now face further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon be brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the UK-based ITV channel.
A source in Jones’s entourage said last night: “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
Hard language ‘and then there was love between us’
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “unsuitable for a president,” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “consistent response” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing with its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We’re doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have ended, hostages have been freed and the physical surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no homes left, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the start-up of international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not seeking international aid, which is difficult for us,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is in the process of putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain if the foreign aid workers will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still extremely poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though there was a warning in force, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship has reached the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s landlocked infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent vast amounts of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is facing a shortage of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting in the streets, with machetes, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge managed Liverpool last Saturday for a loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the top right corner of the net.
He evaded the jump from Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and dared an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea were at rest 1-0, after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed via midfield to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on midfield.
After that, he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool play Wednesday at 15:00 in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, which also caused waves of 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is full of rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street. The body showed puncture wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came who think they know the woman on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim’s family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps saying, “What a shame!”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the depot and a third was just outside.
Within the settlement, a number of agents were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' relic
The expulsion of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the targeting of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many believe is still to be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Chinese Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, whose last name is known only as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stall in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig shed in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pig shed open.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pig-shock.
A forensic study found that the 250kg pig had killed the farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” said the nephew with the surname “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from surveillance cameras shows that Yuan arrived at the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
When an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can elicit aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it has reached the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time on Sunday morning and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northwards, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to rainfall of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona from Sunday night to Monday morning, after which the rains will be more widespread at the end of the day Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate strongly, as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a nice example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the U.S., October is expected to start hot, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States is very high until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on one of six television networks Thursday the harrowing testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the indictment for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was teasing her and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
For comparison, that’s about like for a play-off of a football game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which gives Kavanaugh’s appointment all the support, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's events.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters were yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while being insulted, live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted: ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor, with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something the minority Democrats are pushing for.
Flake was persuaded, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s taxes was ‘absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later stated that he had confessed to shooting Wayde with the death as a result.
His bail has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The city’s East Baton Rouge Coroner on Friday released a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for his “effort and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been “shattered” and “in shock” by Wayde’s death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash that is spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times rumbling and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit central Mexico.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police boiled the officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled their baton up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions continue to mount in the independence-minded region, a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters overwhelmingly declared themselves to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who opposed secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was a flop, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. After all, many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity in anticipation of the referendum in their rightful place.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, declared that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
A crossbow may have been fired at the car at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and delivered Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team equalled Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win an away match during the Premiership. They have to record it Sunday against leader Hearts, who fronts eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston remains undefeated, winning six consecutive games in his division, and coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt’s team could have taken a lead long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it off with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston made an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers had ball possession for a long time, but the defense of the home team was indefatigable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much to do.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly avoided a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a forward from his Livingston colleagues.
Livingston's penalty area continued to be reached, but they were prevented each time. Twice a penalty kick was refused, one after Halkett's attack on forward Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'Fenomenal' - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swept up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed to swallow the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better because they are somewhere in the middle of the standings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police resorted to security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others of being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a flight misdemeanor accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were busy identifying the man and will notify his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Chippers Injured in Disruption
Six cyphers were injured in a disruption to order in a heavily guarded men’s prison, according to the prison bureau.
The riots broke out Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ scapegoats have been deployed to resolve a situation in which eight prisoners are involved in one department.
The chippers were treated there for slight injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed for a current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
"We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will at least be referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison in the hospital had been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive consequences for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for Monday and Tuesday for sudden flooding from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For the areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrisome, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map showing current drought areas, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second-highest category.
The trajectory of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive in Mexico Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rains can occur in parts of Mexico, which carries a significant risk of flooding.
Rainfall of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible, weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then make its way through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger that is expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured Saturday at about 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the commonwealth, the anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "continually suffered under the commonality, the anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before Congress and vigorously and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw Kavanaugh’s ‘beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage’ that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to recognize one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record of service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
“I don’t take part, but I do take part,” he said.
“That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll rising
At least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with many being wiped off the ground when giant waves fell on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high hit the land at the moment it began to dusk. Many people collapsed too flattened and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately walk away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Bureau for Disaster Relief BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,” said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been torn down and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage may be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming at people on the street below to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes carrying supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is only reopened for relief and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office searched for shelter in tarpaulin tents, but passed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups with the difficult task of setting up the emergency aid began, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status is still undeclared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing remained hopeful that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people love to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who took part in the beach festival in the hours after.
However, in his messages, only one gray checker appeared instead of two blue checkers.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during cash machine supply in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man ran after Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, the press release said, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about the identity of the perpetrators, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye for some time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator says.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist name. Earlier, West already told that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, we are it.
I switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which time leftist student movements began to spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said young people often join criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. to double funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number 1 in terms of A.I. innovations by 2030.
“Doubting the budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China is not picking up our best academics, the companies are doing that,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have enlisted the best forces of universities to work on A.I..
Lee said U.S. efforts at A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Those who have a PhD in A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the creation of a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been in decline for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to 'Republic of North Macedonia'. This would resolve a dispute with Greece that has dragged on for decades and would no longer Greece the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of institutions such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia disintegrated.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at the time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would pave the way for NATO membership and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a backdoor,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a “yes” as a result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defence of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shorted Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, winning the match 2–0.
It looked like a one-cent whistle, like Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker first got the ball played on the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero is having problems with his feet,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball with him for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player taped the ball into the net just before it was too far away.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there wasn’t much reason to force a new start.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They currently face one game at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one wildcard for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to do everything possible to secure their first division title.
“While there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals are yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to appoint Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the pitch on Thursday and would pitch the following Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, while speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don’t participate, but actually I do participate. That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “We’re seeing a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we’re seeing it happen now.
And they are determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do to do it, you see the meanness, the meanness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and false and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MPs to get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion of censure because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough, similar issues like these where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And so it was during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Member of Parliament.
Unfortunately, that’s not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view to me, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position I would never have otherwise agreed to, from issues such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, there are social media blunders calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next election, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments on my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that bad slurs are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules the party becomes more petty.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to keep my mouth shut, not just to speak my mind out loud, and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school child, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and that is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not deter me from doing so.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on its way to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat skewed the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right to triumph in this glorious match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a tough time in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did.’
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' match) allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo took an extra lead for Ayr with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the break, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long overdue for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr was able to walk on through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion by Climo.
Then Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled down with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a touch-down at the penalty-line out behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo made the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent half-back Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the restaurant. Apparently, he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun said Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in Glasgow’s ‘blowing restaurant business’.
'The sea is ours': the country-locked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in a rigging-clad naval office in La Paz.
An ocean blue flag is waving at public buildings.
At all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto reads: “The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout the country, Bolivia’s memory of the coastline that the country had to give up on Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the Court’s ruling on the big screen, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of scathing talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, much is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The ruling by the International Court of Justice just six months after the final ruling indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years the situation may have gotten even worse.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has completely undermined all the good will that Chile might have yet to achieve, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other’s country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “utopia” that the enduring sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious when it says it would give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were unthinkable this summer from Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s striking piece was a giant beige hat adorned with a four-pointed wide edge, which hung over the models’ eyes.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons studded with gemstones, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but those weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn together, more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the spread hat with a two-meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a scattering beach bag that was almost as big as the model in swimsuit that wrapped the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, lined with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects ideally within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can deduce that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored high.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as subject matter as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the obstacles to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that stretched above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills.'
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for the first game of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game ahead of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games before the season to prepare,” he said.
Period of Trump's election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a long series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five planned rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he’s fond of, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the job in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will likely be talking about this week’s hearings for candidate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was extra-charged now accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans running for election in November to gain more momentum.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies next week are meant to “encourage volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congressional control is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday marks the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who is getting the best chances right now?
“They first had a six-point lead, and now that’s just four more, so we find a little bit of luck on our side right now,” Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of having four points, while there are twelve more at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tee to green and he sets the right example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well were louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt that made game four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His pit with which she won the match on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly met Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swedes that they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
The European team has played its best so far and has taken a nice lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to go into battle, something that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they stand 10-6 for the United States.
The spirited duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, which now gives them a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the trophy she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blinding Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points during Sunday’s 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches after a sensational weekend.
After taking Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were wonderfully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and third in the world, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run from a slumbering roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult game with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with a four-point lead at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has enough to equalise, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they’ve been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high-handed.
North Korea says it will “under no circumstances” unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to growing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and vowing not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will in no way unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, it struck that he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the U.S. leader said earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be a threat.
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland would be targeted after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and firmly until we have achieved full, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making “walking demands.”
North Korea vowed this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night long while drinking lots of caffeine.
One professor noted that students from the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course, which he knows is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organized for the first time this year, will explain to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment, and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light, and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that with this we will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know what the consequences of choosing cigarettes are for their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in studying overnight still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and increasing pressure on students, lack of sleep is an ever-increasing problem.
Providing adequate, good-quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course because he had taken classes with the professor last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to get up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their away game go disappointing again when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated them 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team had hoped for a first win in an away game since defeating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team led the loss, barely Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, who continue to run at the top of the Premierbro.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston rising to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the fans of the visiting team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team and they passed Ayr and went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who managed to score a point for the Hearts last week. He would have been thrilled with the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents with every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more.
They were supposed to score after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in his sights, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good finish rather than really believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of a game, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to target the Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot with ease.
The Livingston opener in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the overall game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren’t up against Jacobs’ deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and chose Menga, who kicked the ball with ease in the goal.
Gerrard interrupted Coulibaly/Ryan Kent, which had almost immediate consequences when the winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game Livingston prefers to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor held up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came out wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers requested a penalty kick at the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom good can TELL... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the geiger counter.
The geigerteller has since become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film featuring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That’s a geyser counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you set up this headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ and Kill Malignant Cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them in a lab.
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then be re-injected.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is often present in all types of cancer.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells was previously found to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West quits pro-Trump tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was aired on Saturday Night Live after an uncontested performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After he brought his third song of the night, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he staged a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I’d been out of America for a long time,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon squandered Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's tirade was not aired, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It’s not clear if Rock wants to stab the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his cap.
“They kicked me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t stand on the stage with that cap.’
They trampled me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, ‘Do you want to see how apathetic she looks?’ He said he would dress her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
SNL’s cast members seemed embarrassed at least twice, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by one of the attendees: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR THRILLING THE MASS.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just herself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He is free to do whatever he wants.
“Me too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, he is “the creature formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name; he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has also borne the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast police judge on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington pulls out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such roles on the screen, they often think they need to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks “something has gone wrong” and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be tackled in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he strongly believes that the problem should be addressed.
“This is really an important question for me personally right now: where has our masculinity gone wrong?” he said.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, which is why we are now facing this problem?”
Kit believes that television could sometimes be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?”
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
That, in my opinion, is one of the big questions of today: how do we change that?
“There’s clearly something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, as he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
As of November, Kit is in a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during the show, so that’s how I left my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
As early as the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the same period last year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer a criminal offence in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of the conservative values of land, studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffer has leaked data from Republican senators and draws on ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters opposes allegations that one of her staffers placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the allegations are spread by “extreme right” conspirators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more mean lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained information from a Waters employee, the Hill said.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and a blatant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“From here you can pretend that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He must not become rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Fine, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators become known,” she said, “and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British twist, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that indeed seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a sluggish spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satire about how bad we are doing the newest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial stretches manages to send everything in the hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was invented for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the crazy secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a bit of that guy who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire theme song during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) which always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades just tap against his helmet.
Atkinson can show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and Johnny English’s dollish disaster comes to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean who plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Great Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to the great dismay of the acting agent, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must employ a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunner Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are some fun jokes in the story, because the spy lessons of English make you think of School of Rock.
English is soon summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pitiful helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is the captain of a submarine, an insatiable and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
So the Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of raucous doll fun: dressed as waiters they set fire to a shrewd French restaurant, they hurl roars aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English unleashes sheer anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are pulled open, but no matter how well-intentioned and insatiable the scene is, she does some thinking about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is conceiving a plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is reportedly considering a radical plan in which Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants bosses of companies to pass on the savings they are making as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea “fits” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to tilt the country’s balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek was already approved by the Union of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one moment to the next, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party's effort to make the balance in the economy more to the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party already promised a four-day workweek in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day workweek is not a party policy intention and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour’s conference last week to make clear his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless drivers” and the “profits” at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which will give 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview aired Sunday at 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they could discover something that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham’s voice appears to be wall-mounted.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who was named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival is organized, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and that has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concertgoers who wanted to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as doing volunteer work, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise generating meaningful awareness.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of ‘clickivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million “actions” of supporters have been registered since 2011, which were aimed at a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to global leaders’ commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that must change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or brought together by sponsoring actions.
The group estimates that the funds raised to date have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the UK with the aim of ‘helping children realize their full potential’. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice that is undernourished,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions had been sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support reaching 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website, he asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists that will perform this year during the event in New York that is presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian energy exports - Minister of Internal Affairs
Washington can resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to trade in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to ensure that shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that bills itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia’s approach to Iran and noted that these did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only one 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its eyesight from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Berlin’s Trum, has made Moscow a “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers,” Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has elicited a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'seriously considering' taking part in 2020 presidential election, says senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said Saturday that she was "seriously considering" taking part in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was thinking about taking part in the election.
“It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman is in the top position,” she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider making myself eligible to run for president.”
Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall, saying he was "directing this country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters felt she should not stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll by the Suffolk University’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of electing her.
The survey showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats linked to a possible turnout in the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSS at Donald Trump’s election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
“By what my own son is going through, what he is going through now that he’s back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are going through,” she told the audience present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and are tougher, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington, D.C. and 18 states support protest against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington, D.C., filed a statement Friday as a “friend-of-the-court” to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker contesting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace versus Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been released.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that U.S. officials turned down her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people come seeking asylum in the U.S., as countries that have major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "negates decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the "friend-of-the-court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. harms the U.S. economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country “provides the necessary labor.”
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched their nightly possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they are not damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the possibility of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of his feelings as the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remnants of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, and later I didn’t hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever-increasing import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously long governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” as Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now doubles the harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is making use of freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find in vain dissenting voices at a kiosk in central Beijing and you will not see a true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article", if he did not say which newspaper it was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
Now that many prominent Republicans are rallying around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts are warning that this will set them back, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this subject have been enormously heightened and most Republicans have already made it known that they want to continue with the vote.
“These things cannot be turned back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he wonders if Senator Jeff Flake’s (Republican, Arizona) last-minute effort to advocate for an FBI investigation will be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow and they are not going to forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming!” during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote even if they don’t agree with the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans pushed through the appointment.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former party chairman of the Republican Party, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh taking to court, but it’s also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority opting for the latter's side.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or likely believe Ford’s testimony and 35 percent certainly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s lead, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford last week testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her during a party at a time when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not hold talks with Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all their business models in their heads at once.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is being built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and bearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military man is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed to the line of fire and led the line forward before only running to a field shot and shut down three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evidenced by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you’ve stayed up all night to watch a revamped Bellator 206 and you don’t get to see the most important moment.
There were 13 fights listed on the San Jose patch, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were uncomfortably surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night, especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“The government’s regulations do not allow content that is not suitable for children to be shown after 6:00 a.m., and that’s why we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yesss."
Scott Coker, company chairman of Bellator, said they will be adjusting their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also get a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the return race, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these were not all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this will not happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally already did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Olympic ski jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to further education, he did not realize that "not everyone is who I am".
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that parenting had contributed to him attaching less value to winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a scuffle on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than others during his youth because it was "socially not accepted to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so he wouldn’t disappoint people if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you're so young you have to endure so much," he took part in his first Olympics at the age of fourteen and his father died three years later from cancer, it's hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012 was because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t get it over my heart to say, you won’t be there to sit in the front row anymore, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually took hold and he died, I finally could recognize that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd been dreaming about this all my life, diving for a home audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on the way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must regain his form to not make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it’s all about.
Because even at the peak of his career he was never known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs teeming balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will face the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth match on Sunday, who is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 singles matches, start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, although he could honestly hardly do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, hit his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more of it, but it’s how it is and it’s the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also spell the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games to his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain untouchable influence on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s taken, he likes to make jokes with people and he’s a great guy to have on the team.”
“I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy from time to time last week, which was fun to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, calling here after he had seen the 2018 light win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a National 10 lead from LeBron.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan correctly.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we must continue to focus on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players that we can have, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never make progress in this area.
Tomorrow is another challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performance will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re standing alone, your golfing abilities are only really being tested.
That’s the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he should also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the ‘Miracle of Medinah’.
“I remember every damn word of that speech,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had beckoned his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've tuned our line-up to this and are sending the men on their way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try to spell something out of the top hat tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counteroffensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
“I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War warships, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the unsettling problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve as replacements for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are commissioned, Die Zeit notes.
The fatal F125 frigate has already made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would render the warship useless if it were to be deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from a severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the Navy’s ability to carry out further upgrades.
The "Rhineland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class that were deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip become extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually "has a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said the problem has grown over time as a snowball, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available for enlistment in the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat and the aquatic bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crayons of the bat and what kind does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to make a detailed picture on a landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
But bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Landscaping manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Threeave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much about bats is not yet known, and that’s why the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially wiping out a full local population.
Mice are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species we simply don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described allegations of assault as “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to file a lawsuit against the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Via a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news” hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today is fake news,” said the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and through and through," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called “an inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the “moral damage for an amount that matches the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as can be read in the indictment filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent," but that he is sometimes left out that "one percent."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants the scheme to be declared invalid because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and has this summer left for the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' as automakers leave
The UK “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in auto production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added it was "careful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a “no-deal Brexit” would cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal for cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most carmakers worry about risks in the supply chain in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota’s production line is based on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be unrest at the borders that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store stock for more than one day at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would be halted in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was “exactly aligned to avoid those border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told listeners on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is the representative for the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian influence in the election, connections between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been on the agenda for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to dismiss the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein "preferably," but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion of the "attention-seeking" TV journalists, though, she added, "I won't deny that they're trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president does for him,” she said, without providing evidence to that effect, “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly questions, that’s infinitely much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made an outspoken and at times bizarre appearance to the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they continue to work at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months to go before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after sustaining head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery yesterday after sustaining a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennesseen's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters the accident occurred shortly before rest.
“He came to the sideline and he kind of fell into it,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, leaving him tackled a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when buying a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in the vacancy is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a home in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and tell this to multi-earners.
The increase in the vacancy is levied on individuals and firms that do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra revenue being put into an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is on top of the current lows, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rent, could go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 per cent of new construction in London is bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the number of vacancies to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to repair the “housing scandal” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to “no negligence” expulsion.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the 'British Dream', that life gets better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has once become too vague a dream and the humiliation of living without a roof over their heads is all too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it’s his “ultimate ambition” to one day become manager of Scotland.
De Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which currently ranks third in League One, three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the shirt was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I saw my father and Scotland often play in Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps on attracting me.
However, that opportunity would come only if I was successful in managing a club.”
Ross’ predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a major club, having previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is measured at the moment by 'can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
“It’s not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there.”
Ross has only spent three years as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of degradation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took over at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did pretty well, I earned fairly well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things that you face on a weekly basis.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m as good in my skin as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenue of British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenue rise by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, which collected the figures, said: “Due to sunshine and the fact that England took longer than expected to participate in the world championships, July showed a similar pattern to June, when the pubs had turned 2.8 percent more, with the difference that the restaurants were still grazing.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales fared the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants going down.
Pubs that also focus on the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, food sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower.”
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for turnover in the entertainment market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-focused operators and only time will tell whether the more temperate temperatures of August can provide the much-needed respite.”
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data is collected and analyzed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.

Survey of 20,000 High School Students Reveals Growth in ‘Fake Insta Pages’
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main account” that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the ‘fake Insta accounts’, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean “main account” that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally ended up on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager there who asked others to ‘rape’ her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director during the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport’s drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, two of his four Olympic gold medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s been terribly hard work, but I’m now fully recovered, I’ve learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!"
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows, shares online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called the world’s quietest portable breast pump, consumer technology producer Elvie has released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to stuttering mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack on a song that contains lyrics like "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it" and "In case you didn't watch it, these are not udders, these are my breasts".
The chorus then continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, mostly mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that this is the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected to get and give birth to produce milk, but in their case, the babies will be removed within a few days of giving birth," the statement read.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked, “This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted she found the song "hilarious".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for it too much.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are limping (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like just 'cows'.
This ad is not positive or negative about the dairy industry at all."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who sneeze sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a feeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they’re at the push of a button.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between squeezing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the squeezing and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the hard-moist rhetoric and hard-moist policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of jeopardizing their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households must hand out their fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We are prosecuting these people," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to staff at the shelter.
Many of them will be in court via a video conference, rather than in person, to appeal their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be deported soon.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish 'occupation forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for their return and he condemned "spreading irrational fears to some Western countries" that kept most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned a large-scale attack away from Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and clear the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the commission and said the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many ‘liberal’ viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely ended by a deposition procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever".
At the moment, however, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership at CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during “prime-time,” compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” said in a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence Roe v. Wade’s future or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you’ve been sitting in Washington for six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the ‘deep background’ by Bob Woodward in his book ‘Fear’, who are talking about Paul Manafort’s peacock leather jacket, which has cost you $15,000 overdue.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“What he’s doing to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is in part that he’s blocking something new out of you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump show’s rotating cast and the day-to-day plot twists (a fight with the N.F.L.
You can’t afford to miss an episode or have the idea that you’re running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and people saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money flows from outside in the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffle of an electoral district that requires two sitting representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The newly re-arranged district of Pittsburg meets Democratic People’s Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it up against another sitting People's Representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which has much overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were redistributed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided ('gerrymandering') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a bonanza in campaign finance between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-considered special election for Pennsylvania's 18th electoral district.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. is considering punishing El Salvador for its support of China and has refrained from doing so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners shut down the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials set out a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible punitive measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice President Mike Pence will deliver a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible opposition to justice, for which heavy evidence has now become public.
Mueller’s research is also likely to focus on the Trump-Russia campaign’s collusion in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must hold himself accountable to that institution, just as he prepares to address voters again, and perhaps he will hold himself accountable to a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot to consider, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the inexorable march of democracy is thereby accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are currently facing several of these types of tipping points.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this paper reported that, last year, he had suggested to record conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated on the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not honest, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s house.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table where a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien to visit on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use those results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but given the whole game, an equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European night.
Hopefully we can achieve three points but it will be a difficult race because they also had a good result in their last race. But if the public is going to stand behind us, I am sure that we can push through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel-good factor hanging on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind us and be successful again.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s research said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where we'll start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t make your wishes known on time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you’re going to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or investing your equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when the insurance needs to be used.
Make sure you have a health care power of attorney so you can identify a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Capture these details in a written plan so you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are being used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes.”
Man shot several times with air pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been turned off, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that has affected 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie regency in Atjeh, causing destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and providing resistance during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offense, he took her phone off.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su house with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, certain to know" when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and up to a maximum fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference in a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly left to his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York City terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for the sake of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation" according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as "terrible, cruel and corrupt."
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since a case in the Southern District of New York occurred in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize an army of people" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should feel the "heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed to give him the lead of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told participants at the march in Birmingham that the UK “would already be out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling the heavily divided ranks is underscored by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who are taking part in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track while being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Competitors insisted that she will continue and will try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wants to "throw Chequers in the trash."
He suggested that Farage should be ridden and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he quit the service, we'd be out of it now," Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go door to door and ensure that we are elected.
Let the Chequers fall and listen."
In a targeted message to May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the gathering that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today together to say to them, ‘We’re not letting you get away with this.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to shine a light on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the national army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags bearing Tories Against Brexit, following the creation of this group over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the House of Lords for Labour, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'think well' about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think well about her candidacy for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican MP who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of speculation that she might be in a fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One of the attendees asked her if she would stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time for women to go to Washington to restore our flawed government and that includes a woman at the top.”
LSU's Wayde Sims Arrested After Shooting Dead
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and died of the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and confessed to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing a firearm and shooting down Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and is being held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel let him win after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowd's tail, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top after a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari rider to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was the leader of the race for a long time, because he stayed with his tyre choice and aimed for a quick finish, so he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has been doing his best fantastically all weekend. He was a real gentleman and let me pass.
The team has done its best for places one and two," Hamilton said.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during an election rally on Saturday over the fact that she did not continue to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly talk about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he let it be known that what was happening in the Senate showed that people can be "bad, unkind, and untruthful."
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untruthful,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - 'oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the allegations against Kavanaugh were mentioned to Feinstein were sent by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her office was the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't give a damn who they hurt, who they have to drive about to seize power and regain control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have cleared Friday’s loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had a two-goal lead with scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie sided with the home team before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up for a lag on Friday night to then beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer caused the Giants to take the first break with a lead when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard brought them back to an equal standing with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies as he makes sure hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is revered as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people on board could safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried beneath the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild back-and-forth moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was ready for takeoff at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had a helicopter set up from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to a thousand and let the country’s disaster-fighting agency know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were lying under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: “I appeal to all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for the evacuation.
Are you ready for it?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight, which crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says another man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane was hit by water while landing at the Chuuke Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot down over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and a few others managed to wade through the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working in the vicinity of a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG in the last twenty years, but this does not apply to Air Niugini.
Analyst records timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a testimony lasting several hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used mobile phone call records to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was standing in the witness stand on Saturday and told that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis erased the text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol state that hip-hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and the appearance of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make ‘conscious hip hop’ popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City girl is suing a couple for a 'racist' text
A New York-based nanny sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about "another such black man".
The couple denies being a racist and calls the lawsuit "depression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negro woman when she met her on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEE IS SO BLACK AGAIN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, who felt "uncomfortable" when she realized her blunder, saying that their previous child-wives, who were African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple to the court to get compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months she was hired to bivouac internally with the family, albeit without a contract.
“I want to make them feel like you’re just not doing something like that,” Maurice told the New York Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple sneered at the claim that she was racist by saying it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, feared they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Turn it off.'
Comparing the trial to “pressing,” Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That’s not so nice,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still going on, public opinion is quick to capitulate to the couple on social media, where they are touted for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly revealed letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s approval, said of the letter: “It’s hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She said her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt "bittersweet" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
"But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like a child's achievement; you're proud of yourself for doing nothing for it.
I think he experienced about Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to get it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad’s phone call came to say she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before that and this process turned everything off further.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry, cry or cry because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to stay big.”
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going to go through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I was sitting with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Rubbing women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make strong efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys Paste Inspirational Messages and Phone Numbers That Can Call People in Need for Help on a Bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and resident of Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile brightened every room.
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly making sure there's a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be silent – talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt gloomy or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all over the ground on Christmas Day – when the kids took out their presents, he didn’t look at them at all or anything.”
She said his death was a big trauma for her, but that they had to deal with it: “It rips the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI probe begins
"I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for; an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a bit more unity again," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" in the middle of a firmly entrenched patch.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to set up an investigation?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and so his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary, got to know him.
What happens when the FBI gets the report ready?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human traffickers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of the defectors from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily secured Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are formally still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of failing to make progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without faith in U.S. action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step to unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', finds him unfit to serve in Supreme Court
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "gross and coordinated character assassination", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she found Kavanaugh's testimony to show that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to set up an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this about him; if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would go against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh bypassed questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to stand up and applaud when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit to it.
It’s a righteous tirade of months and years of rampant anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge of something and who told me that she too would cry if she got angry. She developed a method, by which she would cry whenever she got angry. Against the one she was talking to, she said: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly allowed as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best-remembered memories from a previous job, in a male-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was so angry. An older woman, a cool business manager who everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my throat and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you on the cabinet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat sickness' or 'apes') and retired from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt there was no reason why she couldn't afford to leave.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision,” she told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was left with fundraising, and so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign after all, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of deputies, and of anger over sexism — that she staggered.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of how the media reacted to her.
“They will have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"They were crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the fight has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, experts say, be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, gave the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled for $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) worth of goods; half of all goods coming from China to the U.S.
Beijing has taken reprisals every time in kind, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to equalize the U.S. every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink a quick eye.
In order for Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the U.S. is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays it smart, the trade war with the U.S., China could positively support in the longer term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would allow one of the two countries to end up in an economic free fall is actually much more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said in a press release.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a more than seven-year war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in his country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An estimated six million people still live in the country, who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that had subsidised the insurgency.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, allowed his long stroke from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, and conceded his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of four players to ever score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest ranked player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
“The enormous pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods, I always followed that guy when I was growing up,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The US captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve fought.
We have made Europe a little more difficult this morning.
We offered resistance.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We are overplayed.”
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in concentrations of Red Fever in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the U.S.).
According to the commission, there are reports of fragmentary increases in the red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.

There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots to see, but in fewer places than last week.
There was also a red glow in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported for the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, low to high concentrations for the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or near the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or near the coast of Lee County, and high concentrations at or near the coast of Lee County.
