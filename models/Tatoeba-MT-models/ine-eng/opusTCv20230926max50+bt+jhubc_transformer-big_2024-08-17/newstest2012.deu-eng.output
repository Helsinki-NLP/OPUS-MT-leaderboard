No Liberating Novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko had been convicted as part of a draft of the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Prime Minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the request for the easing of penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet legally valid, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to be removed from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libya's victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners can be defined.
As is usual in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which ones - the moderates or the radical ones.
The National Transitional Council recognized the custom of the Shari<0xCA><0xBF>a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand.
Women, too, should forget about emancipation as soon as possible, any apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran from mutually reinforcing tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that is hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Just - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best, and the variety would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
As an excuse, only the fact that the NATO airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit, may serve.
The victors in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only participated in a shootout, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the tenants are a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price even without occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can at last rightly boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not, the Shari'a representatives will destroy them.
The beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm swept through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France were declining.
Today, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are keeping an eye on not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Union, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France’s by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France conceded a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend of slowing growth in economic performance was thus confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overestimated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the euro area and the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds rose by 28.45%.
Yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for Euro
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well laid out goalie <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won thanks to the weak home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro quite happy 1:0 and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football championship.
Due to the Czech team’s precise defense, they put pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Thanks also to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech team will participate in the European championships next year, and it is also a pleasure that the local football will receive a prize of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams combined a long time and so was played mainly around the midline.
In the second half too, the pressure of the home team remained and the wide shots in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the facility on Tuesday afternoon and then announced the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make known that they are ready to protect the core program of their country, if necessary also with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon for a long time.
There is also talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed the day before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the US and Israel.
In the event of a deliberate attack that largely crippled Iran’s nuclear program, the Israeli press from the center in Isfahan would also target Natan’s nuclear enrichment facility.
The menu of a fatty child: It does not eat breakfast and eats for dinner sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as often on the table as in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had an evening meal on the eve of the education campaign under the motto "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families with toddlers, sport is not one of the favorite occupations, but the majority of today’s students also do – only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic surveyed.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grade participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed led, five times a day, to eat breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-evening bread mode - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," said one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are also important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of students’ families eat breakfast.
And in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
Worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy apples are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do - namely only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to come up with their own meal plan based on their appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Apprehensive is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pastries beat just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who filled out the questionnaire after the conclusion of the enlightening lecture "Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project stated.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish much more often as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had a bit of a crush on the fact that that was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what was yet to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam is, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, that is most of us.
One has a neck that is too short, the other has a figure that is too young without proper curves and the other is too chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually cover wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging, without making her look too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don’t fit, you should at least have a piece made to measure.
You won’t regret it, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailored skirt you feel much better than in one of the bar, which always slips up and down, stands out in the waist, etc.
Boys can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bushings, applications, embroidery or rapture.
With so much information and character types, I’m glad I have a whole week to let it all go through my head.
And yet, I am afraid that in view of the assigned homework, it is almost impossible to do.
Each of the participants of the course was assigned a celebrity, for whom she should come up with suitable outfits - daywear and eveningwear.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I’m cheering, because that’s a lot better for me personally than wearing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained 100 kilos in recent times (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or look for them on the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was immediately spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, such as a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to cremate the sleeves or collar and at the same time the whole look is quite different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to me: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
I finally understand why we have to break all these teachings, what to combine with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing options than he is ultimately photographing.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So all of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> also confirmed that image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be out-of-pocket money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is second-rate).
And if one of us can already style himself, then we should expect that he or she is more likely to impose a completely different (smaller) size on us than he or she actually needs.
Then all you have to do is google to be sure that the boulevard press is writing, the corresponding celebrity has gone back to or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario put us at heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit "combine".
In his work he has to communicate primarily with the people he styles and he has to be a dedicated psychologist.
People evaluate without offering themselves and standing by their opinion.
“If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and to add nice pieces, we can’t clear out the whole closet and say, ‘Oh my God, that’s terrible.’
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag, which you button at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (so the stylist helps out when photographing products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the back of the clothes is picked up, if it is not too big, natural (pink under the heel).
But so that we not only have to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We're stuck and we're stuck...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to act skillfully.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill I mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me by now - devoting yourself to styling on a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The originally carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, amateurish mistakes to the routine ride to the early layer.
While the ambitions were largely met, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the store, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he didn't actually seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the fitted passages turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is tempered by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So these are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t get the impression that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn landscape or up through the deep snowy landscape seems very visually pleasant.
From time to time, unusual elements bring a bit of variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely limits the view.
In the mountains, in turn, one must be hellishly careful that one is not spilled by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that includes the police, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations, in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (in particular, probably only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage, because this element at least has no chance to get boring - it belongs in the context of the above, among the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model moves in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, although it does not tear down trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look elsewhere.
But for an action-packed race, the local driving model will continue to do well, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Real problems do not appear until after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
From a game of this kind is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you practically have no idea before any impact on any object, how the car behaves, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: When passing or overtaking approaching cars, in some places you "strip" the other car only slightly, but in other, almost identical situation, you get into the swing and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car straight to junk.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter anymore, it is always annoying.
The restarts are resolved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should not rely on them.
But sometimes restarting doesn’t even help, because nothing else helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It’s a shame that the same things often happen in the same place.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, “civil” cars are always in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes two cars in front of you, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that it always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again here regardless of the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously overtake someone here to get the hell out of here.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes a look at you, so that at first you drive your own car there a few times in Klump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly loses the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost no longer know where one’s head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car in the course of the races.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the route, because it is here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical trips, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual localities that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To reach the higher driver level, various items need to be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the online function Autolog, which compares its own results with those of other players and also provides further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get by car into a subway tunnel (myways), where you can ride on the rails for a long time in the dark (myways).
On the tacho, numbers look between 150 and 200 km/h (myself), but then suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial staff we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the image repetition frequency slows down and sometimes this is quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use at all.
The sound is as far as OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as wide a range as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack was created a l<0xC3><0xA1> "from everyone something" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game hadn’t been tempered by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But somehow the game seems unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but one should be prepared to face these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions to a tangible halt."
I wouldn’t have expected such a hard war to burn out.”
“It will take five, six years for the scales to smooth out and everyone will have gotten used to their new role,” began Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how seriously she takes the motto "Understandable and open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown up in such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath away how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a man who is ready to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them, and who above all has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil mills Quargel
Mrs Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lives and is planning to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government’s fall during the presidency as a major negative that had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full swing.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only in the Presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated, precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it is going to be a slim and economical budget, which industries will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be less promoted - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's gruesome abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know whether you are actually making curly or round cucumbers and various large bananas in Brussels, or whether someone actually wants to ban us from quargel?
She would also have liked to use the EU soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakian is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you guys up to - is that your V4 again?' and makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects in the future above all hard rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
Much more realistic than a "European Federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want to work together and those that don't should stand quietly apart."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> expects.
In this regard, it also recognised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues affecting the entire EU must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, then this would probably be the word “longitudinal”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity was laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, the business and also the society over the course of our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson already operated his employees’ social care in the thirties – in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out system of remuneration for the best newcomers and herders.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, which Palmisan will be replaced at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and has previously held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations are emerging.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, after all, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to directly shape it through this presence.
IBM – in the states of its logo called “Big Blue” because of its familiarity, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It’s one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include e.g. ATM machines, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of about $220 billion, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (similar to Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - for example, unhappy were the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computer IBM PC Jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you can’t tie yourself emotionally to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms — and if they don’t work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
Services, software and hardware account for one-fifth of IBM’s profits.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, but at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis intact.
The value of IBM’s shares has rocketed by 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s net income is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only the values can’t.
That is why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM Story: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name – Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later IBM company was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history goes back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies, such as the famous card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the rival Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - Watson's ideas are still based on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for trade – from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its revenues to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computers at NASA's IBM helped direct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture – the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of the time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thereby fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of “Smarter Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a smart way in areas that have not yet been planned, e.g. also to improve the situation in traffic and in city administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform, which is designed to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia – the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became their lover by the patron of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), Darina still had hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> had offered refuge to the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> in her own house, she probably would not have imagined the dream, as it turns out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any on her insistence after 30 days, Joseph immediately accompanied her.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> should leave Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out.”
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have some ties," said Mrs Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>; but she also said that she has already separated herself emotionally from him and insists only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him, Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, it doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I am having a normal conversation, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (the paper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I have fallen in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female vices: How are you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female prostitutes, they will shake some out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we pass a few unsightly reviews again, which let the men swallow the blood in their veins?
Shopaholic
Does her husband accuse her of being a shopaholic?
Do you have to buy at least one hat per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more when it comes to promotions?
In your case, it’s really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite under control.
But hand in hand, what woman can’t wait to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband - would you rather stay outside...
Constant Dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do you like me at all?”
Does this seem familiar to you?
- Yeah?
Then you are probably also among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, scrubbing the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, do you scold the children because the recently broken sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this type of "deviantness", then you should know that you should not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
In the end, this immeasurable sense of purity can also harm mutual relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Sticheln
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You can't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, that’s not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to sneeze as much.
Clatches and Tratches
Some women like to clap and stomp, there is squealing behind the back or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to go through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well each of us women has a bit of harmless chatter and treachery in stock.
Hand on heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with rattles of the grossest calibers, to which nothing and no one is sacred, which probably despises everyone in their environment and which represent a considerable danger, especially for women’s collectives.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek help Philadelphia win with their assists
The ice hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr had a big part in the Monday game of the NHL with two assists at the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star, who added an assist and was named the best player of the match.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr's teammate Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the same game.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr claimed after the game to journalists that he had prophesied a great evening for Giroux.
"Even before the game, I'm telling him he's doing a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that.”
"Such a feeling comes up again and again," explained J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal already at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the whistle of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then again belonged to the Flyers.
Giroux in particular.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third goal, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
“I wouldn’t have thought in my life that I would be playing with an ice hockey player like him for the rest of my career.”
"I'm very happy about that."
"I'm cutting my game to myself."
“All the years in the NHL my teammates put their game on me and now the spear is turning,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr smiled.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who came through from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two versus one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more remote posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said of the match's last match from his point of view.
With this victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek was injured in the game against Buffalo and died in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens, in addition to their experienced Beck, also fined their lead an undefeated in the penalty shootout 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they played the game with only five defense players to finish.
"That's bad."
“We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young players.
“But there’s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay, contributing significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West only selected ones were allowed at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia struck a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the USSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even stay in your sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
The matter had not gone on for a long time.
The so-called currency requirement - the condition for a trip to the West - was only granted to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without currency usage it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and datschen - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, of which you are not even aware today, is the fact that you could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, foreign exchange duty was abolished in the neighboring Western European countries, which resulted in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park on trips to Paris in the tent, because who would have had the money for an accommodation in a hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature when travelling abroad from the Czech Republic at that time was a luggage room packed with canned goods, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus the average wages also increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare travel by charter flights after 1997, which made air travel incredibly affordable compared to the past thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czech Republic, with the exception of the United States, had already had foreign exchange-free payment transactions with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of “post-salt” travel came in 2000 when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country – to Thailand – was completed.
Since then, every year, direct charter flights with Czech passengers fly to distant sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flown directly from the Czech Republic.
The 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per head for a single holiday stay including the cost of the holiday resort.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again threatens a pact.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To this day, there is still no agreement as to which electoral order should be chosen.
And without this, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post, urging his colleagues to agree on a strong personality that could guide football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels between the two Association Chambers broke out again, which can not agree on a common candidate.
This became clear on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People’s House in the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the general meeting - only the constitutional representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, to which also contributed the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was that representation on a proxy basis was not permissible.
However, the disputes over the electoral order continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The point of dispute is whether to act in accordance with the statute, or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R's three deputy presidents who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is reportedly ready to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, even if it turns out that the constitutional electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is that as far as possible the statute will be chosen."
"So that no senseless substitute variants can be invented, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said owner Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements, especially against Pelta.
However, Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football championship today would certainly contribute to calming the mood."
"If football rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to 'bend' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
“But I hope that common sense ultimately wins,” Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter plane, with which among other things Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage play.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level is probably crucial, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of Czech football and also the upcoming General Assembly of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is supposed to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting, could have made a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have been involved in the fight for this top position at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I spoke to some of the people in question in person."
"I can't believe some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is seen behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"In his victory, the current state of affairs would be preserved and in Czech football there would be no progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that some time ago, Pelta's name fell in connection with phone calls to investigate a corruption case, but emerged from the Pelta without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory from Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees something more relaxed.
Should Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k win Thursday’s election, however, he could well imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the October general meeting, thinks it ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills".
"I could imagine him well, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the club as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in things I don't understand," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September had caused a stir with the fact that he was behind the dismissal of the Arbitration Commission with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels the role of the president of the association has grown.
And referring to his skills in running private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which even in adverse situations degenerates," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who does not make a dent in his antipathy, for example, towards Spartan leader Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby top political politicians for more money to flow out of the lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new president should be dedicated to."
“When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to be very clear about where the money is going,” he said.
His association with the Pilsner Klub also does not see Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "over-party".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“That’s not exactly ideal.”
"In my opinion, it does not make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person, to return after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which exclude a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would be strong enough to get the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes, which in the future exclude disputes over the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday’s Nymburk hearing and believes that the election campaign will surely weaken in the event of a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and fundraising if he was elected.
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone," said the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That’s why he believes he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association that he used as a means of attracting delegates.
"If I'm going to be president, I'm going to take it personally and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work out."
“This is a principled thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
Earlier, he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also stopped attacking Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
“His attacks were downgrading, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
"That is why many now doubt his real character," Pelta told his counterpart, who is likely to remain faithful to his proclamations, which he had already made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the emblem of Czech football.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the cause of Bohemians to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Soon after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personal clean-ups.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
“If really the only point of contention is how to pick in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility, and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta said in a statement two days before the potentially crucial day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If former vice-chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly leave many people in the association in a state of disenchantment.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has started.
“As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, to professional football, to youth performance football."
“That’s not to say that I want to do everything alone,” Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competencies in the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I’m going to distribute hard tasks so that football advances in every segment with milestones.”
Many would not be particularly happy about it, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don’t necessarily throw buttons between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation for why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up because other people would.”
“That’s trust that you can’t lose,” he said.
He also allegedly motivates him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw that away.”
"Proceedings have been started that will probably only come into force in a few years and I would just hate to see them stop," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I can be accused of some things, but not of being biased."
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is just a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravians."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then rose to the first league in each case."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who is also saving tens of millions of kroner for unfavorable contracts, agreeing on television contracts and negotiating the lottery.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the start to help the Czech football to new confidence", he considers the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k a strong candidate who really has something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the staffing in the commissions would obviously not fundamentally change."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bend things in his favor,” Rajchl says of his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jumping into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschpool in UFO-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she gazed up at artfully designed domes, she met swam marble puddles waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she took it in flight in her notebook - along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by architectural historian Meder - and she now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreiden": Volksswimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, she does not have much on her mind, says Meder - only in the water it is different.
It’s just annoying that swimming fans have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the bewitching scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird whispers in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says the Vienna-based meder.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Plaster in the spring pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have put in the effort, swimming pools can be a real treat: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an ancient karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Ter<0xC3><0xB6>m<0xC3><0xA1>l).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: in the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the movement on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathing guests in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: the Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, three open bowls are used for steaming, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine in his nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so strongly of heating oil that it is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonated healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing area in the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked area.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds grow between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bathroom already has three phases of construction; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a feat to merge so many different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is obviously only a minor matter.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank to shine a light on its raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw material business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg –
For the German citizens, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even call for Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to leave this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the sugars have decoupled from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business was "worthy of jeopardizing Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how reckless banks today are harming the general good."
Ackermann is now a top banking lobbyist, especially in his duty.
“Deutsche Bank has to remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not switch to the Supervisory Board in any other way than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses, he hardly needs to shave - this would ultimately have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven percent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that place bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, cancel all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy ends: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and worked.
It will now be reopened as an exhibition hall.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress are swarming, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, rebuilt and opened in 1962 in a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable as a spatial and technical museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has completed the new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctoral art historian with a notable career in the youth as an art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion with politicians and monument keepers, she acquired public funds and private traces.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small state
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "incredibly important place" for him, where he had "almost every weekend" to look at the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and its re-use.
There were much bigger problems with the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy sling", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel girders have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements provided space for new use, a lowered light trench between house and street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection shade.
And the cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small state.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rocky floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It has been difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because it has occurred an urban luck case: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Main Station Quarter", with office and residential buildings, is being created.
And another good luck case may still occur: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city about a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans winter crisis package in millions
The train has devised a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The Bild newspaper previously reported, citing an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros are planned.
This will improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to rid the railway platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours and to remove 90 percent of the necessary traffic lanes by the time the operation begins.
Two months ago, R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, the head of railways, had warned of train failures and delays this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
For example, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making it possible for years for it to have axles of ICE trains checked much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions in U.S. fines
After the turmoil around Chef Josef Ackermann, a new bad news comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now also recovering its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of misleading the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost much of their value during the financial crisis and plunged the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a German bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in lawsuits to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to recover billions of dollars in damages.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also sued other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage-backed securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers tipped over.
Even though the events have been going on for several years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek redress or to acquit wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
She accuses 18 major international banks of over-priming two US state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, in which it deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses", without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as non-sustainable and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly forecasted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly blow in the financial world.
As a result, IBM’s IT foundation can now be called “Sir IBM”.
Buffett revealed in CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which had made decent profits even in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for quite some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked, for example, a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of major companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname “Oracle of Omaha.”
After the Buffett investment was announced, IBM’s stock rose by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange in total, and together with Apple and Microsoft is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn’t want to step in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and one Greek small business owner between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German population in Germany, fear and anxiety are responding to this message.
For many German Turks, a long-believed ghost returns: since the fire attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is hostility towards foreigners in Germany was never in question.
The uncovered right-wing extremist network, however, reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded in a thoughtful manner: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a wake-up call at the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought of a fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media acts like a slap in the face: "Germany's Gift to the Fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the series of murders.
Even the German edition of the "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of the column by Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci.
He stresses that people have been murdered, that taxes have been paid and that their work has made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critical is the discussion in German Internet forums about the procedure of the police and their subsequent success in the investigation.
Why the German authorities did not think much more about searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If we continue to slug here, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defence and armament".
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger is illustrated by the attacks of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruin is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the We-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at that time how many taxes the local Turks were paying.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts to comprehensively investigate and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's up to a German to judge.
This is not what Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Schweizer Gro<0xC3><0x9F>bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was happy in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity, and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"UBS has achieved the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel".
In September, it became clear that everything would be different.
A trader at UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and squandered around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since also been considered a hit - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors as early as May – not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and central banker and would certainly have needed a training period.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it deserves the title of "largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the silent and solid Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
On the one hand, UBS in 2007 managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it was promoted to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: how could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment arm had been squandered with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of say and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors for this, but one that some would have had their noses pierced until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secretive that you didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, with Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, the second-highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigning in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the midst of a financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a bond that allowed it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions, including penalty fees.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped in the tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through the mis-speculation and in asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it became a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it again, then follows this unfortunate dealer story: A single dealer beckons 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is wrong.
And it will be obvious: With risk management in investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich's banking institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago taken to become guardians of the great assets of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - even if the world might collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the well-established Swiss private bank - it is only slightly larger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as the Confiserie Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
You enter the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large signpost to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point displaced - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS had become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million country decided the biggest rescue in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ss in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks merged into one giant group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
It helped that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came to a favorable amount of money, with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, the humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked his way up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel ultimately relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that arrogance came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly uttered the same word: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That's what the UBS wanted, all the way up.
Some steps had already been taken.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the very top.
However, corporate consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime assets.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans – but also kept risks to itself.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way out.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says bank expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the case.
One manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Posts at the UBS became the headquarters of the swindlers and are still wobbly.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all its obvious business models.
Banker Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new head of banking Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor, Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he is to run the business of UBS permanently, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to its position in the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he has said only that he will seek an apartment in Zurich with his wife for the first time.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. stock market
The looming recession in Europe has emboldened U.S. investors for the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome were without force.
The strained industrial production on the continent stifled hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Italian and Greek glass have been considered half-full over the past week, not half-empty – but now the problems are back in the spotlight, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
In the course of trading, the market barometer shifted between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq index lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5,985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the pile and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and allowed him to initially record almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has reportedly paid an average of $170 apiece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares declined by 2.6 percent significantly more than the market.
The company silvers almost all of its remaining shares in China Construction Bank, with a net loss of $6.6 billion.
The Institute wants to increase its capital ratio with the net profit from the business and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates on Sunday ordered 50 long-haul machines of the 777 type and estimated the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 additional machines, the volume even amounts to $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values were added, 2281 were added and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart Crows are Spreading in Cities
In many places, sows are considered "problem birds": however, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
So far, a remedy against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
Seeds are no longer to be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural escape of particularly protected crops: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made it difficult for the birds to live.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had provided for negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with batons as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the grubbing-up, does not bring anything," noted the town and landscape planner Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver from Leer.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often has undesired consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"The animals are moving away, large colonies are splitting up and spreading out to other places."
Embarrassment is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable that a combination of grazing of the animals from sensitive living areas and lure offers to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens called for a completely different way of dealing with animals: "After all, we can tolerate a speck in the face with the best confidence."
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Kr<0xC3><0xA4>hen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, on which signs inform about the lives of the highly intelligent seed-breeds.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: sowings not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the intelligence of birds on four sowings.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones in order to reach a moth larval stage.
Without much training, they purposefully realized what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the cocky crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid pieces of wire for them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then caught the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed-rows even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo to shoot Portugal at Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are participating in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship appearance after the 0-0 draw.
The Czechs scored a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off back-to-back game with outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also had a 0-0 win over Turkey, while Ireland had a 1-0 win over Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the next goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) had cut twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the playoffs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal won a bespoke start.
Ronaldo chased a free-kick from around 30 meters to early lead into the masques.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting qualities and scored from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger from the English leader Manchester City put a headball on the bottom edge of the slat, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty room, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time that the European champion has been to the European Championship since 1976.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a terrible second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech with a reflex at the last moment prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic shot from the turn of the penalty line just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossbar had to be saved for the already beaten world-class Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
At the same time, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink thus has to almost certainly clear his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in an European final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a ranged shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the horror second, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made way for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 victory in the innings.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) equalled for the guests.
Ireland pushed for the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back-up team prevent the possible leader hitter.
In the 32nd minute, it was over.
After an unfortunate defense by Schlussmann Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball 1-0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
The Dax Group said on Tuesday that it expects to make about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
"We will create additional R&D facilities and hire staff accordingly," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of offices of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A History of the First World War, told in Nineteen Fates" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to one's heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s novel narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not inappropriately describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about how it was.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
"Beauty and Terror" almost brings together the experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy, or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some come in addition while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" walks with expert views on other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you take flight?
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suppositions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were mostly taken from memories, letters, and other previously published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or moving, but they are extremely alive in the depths of the collection of small moments that are lost in detail.
Many of them act out of want and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper joints, wooden buttons."
He talks more about food replacements in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammock fat (and most recently served with a wrong bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were soaked with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of the war: "You feel that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than to sit in a chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so as signifying such a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of civilization and as if he could not stomble on it."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or take care of it.
“If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations deal with old Europe falling apart and new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unpredictable ways and there is frivolous behavior as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who were actively trying to infect themselves with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the front line service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade of gonococci eggs, because soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war unleashed “uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Im Westen nichts Neues" rather than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it up here anymore.
But it is as if with his book he had snatched this page away from us with the main characters in front of his nose and lit it with a matchwood.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided on the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all others initially believed to be participating in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the occupants a huge increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as “exercise.”
“The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials at the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters gathered after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including task forces from across the city – hundreds of mobile officers usually deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that over the course of the day many people enter and leave the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people are staying in the park,” he said.
Lifeguards with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that sounded from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials broke into the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to keep them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officers was very rough.
Mr Browne said television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
As the police moved westwards through the protestors’ large mess of personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf, and bags of clothes, their cleaning staff followed, unpacking what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to leave, were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main nucleus of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some barriers were erected and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency response officers were called in to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, he said, due to "unnecessary behavior and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not lead the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block of streets north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were erected.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were seen driving people out.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of Guardians will file suit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of schoolteachers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the dismissals, due to their inappropriate influence on schools teaching poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory.
The lawsuit is probably the last option still open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs in a chess match on October 7, have described the union leader as political revenge for the fact that in the last year the city was denied access to a health fund, which the working groups were being held hostage to.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a City Council hearing, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that had been passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that there was nothing in the budget to specify that school aid workers would be fired.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Department of Education about a lawsuit, and there will be a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Justice, said the city did not file the lawsuit and thus could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit filed with the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of school layoffs in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit over inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She states that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and only a few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 helpers were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Finding the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “This is not a neighborhood of bespectacled parents who can organize donations to collect budget cuts.”
P.S.: The 36th district’s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo approving the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been fired, not transferred," the complaint states.
Mission Completed, Congress Ready to Agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already in agreement on the insurgency in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American meddling.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee passed a resolution under the chairmanship of John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage."
“This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support for their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the U.S. military’s role in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution that approved the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate, and the House passed a decision to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory – with a Congress that was agitated enough to criticize Obama’s actions as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally take the floor off his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Relations Committee or will they split the legislature, as the June law did?
The final version comes amid opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee’s top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that currently comes to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatt’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others only slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients — especially beginners at Republicans who want to polish up their resumes — the opportunity to brag about having “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the two-term limit on the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage is, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring pattern.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As zealously as members propose changes, they move much faster than they have in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators tabled 77 such amendments. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Struck but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after being shot by an armed man from the nearest distance during an election event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffford (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, singing alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying that the desire to recover was in consternation.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ranked by words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet, which split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to cast her vote triumphantly on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — and described her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the couple's new book was released: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The Special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8th attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with her head shaved bare and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
A tickle with the lip.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You can see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he had read Giffords an article in a daily newspaper on March 12 about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
Alleged gunman Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is being medically treated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, hart, hart."
In the course of recovering his wife, Kelly Sawyer recounted, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you’ll get through it and you’ll recover and you’ll come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was watched by Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring, American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they were hurting people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support us is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took up a high-level state post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewees were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely hailed by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public mostly focuses on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military Faces Growing Pressure to Break Through Hard in Rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether to prosecute 28 women and men for non-intervention in a rape case before the military court.
Should this not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant at week 11 when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxiously await a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed to go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to award an acquittal.
Burke says she's pursuing top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retribution?"
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court’s files, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for violations that have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers on active duty.
“The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs’ military service,” the document states.
The Department of Defense denies any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time to modernize the military, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits are pending besides her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies over alleged promotion of a female-hostile atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that victims of rape received to release them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Network Women's Right.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the War Veterans Administration), in which she accused her of discriminatory practices in her handling of performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of cues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. Office for the Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse), 3,158 sexual abuse cases were reported.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this number accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases it comes to each year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people spoke as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought the woes would come. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out again I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure.'
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first called into question.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military lags a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important to them that they try.”
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will begin her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Watching You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a rampage in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by no means alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media pages.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the add-ons invited users to a survey asking them about their educational status, their attitudes toward violence, and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to poll more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without ever having to leave their offices.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male, and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “Data Supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you usually don’t reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to interview people from the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first, and they would never have given them access,” Bartlett said.
“With Facebook, it all falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to recognize and resolve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunk driving on Facebook were significantly more likely to problem-drink than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as residential counselors, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, Washington.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into its own population data.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to – digital freedom champions have long known that the site should make its large data repository accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to use its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, anything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two riots in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight of Norway,” he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
“I recognize the laws, but I don’t plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered Breivik police to keep him in custody for another 12 weeks, saying he had no access to the media for four weeks and that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was staying behind the castle and bars.
All of them took part with the goal that everything was a lock-out.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may be pleasing to some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim's family said.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week ahead of special film screenings in key markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an meticulous organizer who worked diligently on diagrams—a man who believed that many managers suffer from “a disease of thinking” that “a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work...[but] there’s a huge amount of ideas between a great one and a great one.”
In 1995, Bob Cringley developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fachidiots" about the breakup of the personal computer. And he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in Fachidiotes, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing at the time of delivery.
Only after Jobs’ death was a full VHS copy discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be screened at the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who’s known for loathing detailed interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds afterthoughts, in which jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient with Cringely’s questions and prompts him to move more quickly on more important topics or side actions.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow uncannyly far-sighted when evaluating jobs, which other companies do in his opinion right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumously about Career Jobs, but seeing jobs here as the aspiring dreamer on the verge of greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled away and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?". And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks about things in depth.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded—mostly starting with “standard costs” that were quantified to mere conjecture and then adjusted to “deviation”—he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was framed:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and conduct long-distance conversations for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a toll-free phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another as they traverse as many satellites as possible.
“We sent stuff half a dozen times around the globe and when you got on the phone, it came back out in the phone next door a minute later,” Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think without it Apple would exist.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious ploy Wozniak and he had almost pulled when they called the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were doing the best they could to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he recalls the problems he had when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember compelling arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly believable.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants got stuck with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, right?"
You own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are] the kind of people who ultimately run the businesses and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position will be eradicated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products – craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft had been in the 1990s.
They have won the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it runs out of taste, it runs out of trying to deal with the best thing that humans have created, and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for the computer industry, they’d be doing fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health care laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will take the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became the buzzword for conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing: in fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to boost the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be tipped will likely be Paul Clement, a former attorney general under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company sponsoring the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is hugely involved financially in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case at a Washington hotel.
Service included Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a vocal opponent of health care reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charitable events of law and other organizations, the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, were enough to alarm moral and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morals and the contradiction to the Code punishes the lawsuits of some judges’ lies, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings in court."
Their appearance and their support of a donation campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
In contrast, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing to land record $18 trillion order
Emirates has ordered 50 twin-engine Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 trillion.
Just as unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
At the weekend, Boeing announced its largest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-seat Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline has also announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, raising the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8s were ordered, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural defense,” he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms Boeing’s leadership position in the wide-body aircraft market and helps to keep Airbus’ competitor SAS in check, which is attacking dominance with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350 directly competing with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Apparently Loses Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported him in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her bid for the governorship of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for governorship in the western state.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have occupied polling booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly defeated Claderon, who had led the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have emerged from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look bravely into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic nations must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look “passionlessly” at the difficulties in Europe, and said financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
The European Monetary Union has entered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The looming severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging markets to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support to Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – would offer greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and drying up foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that emerging economies like India have no incentive to help wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India’s aid to Europe, more than $800 million of whom are living on $2 a day or even less.
"Someday they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid civil servants in Greece, with jobs in poorly run, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone would have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/now threatens “the risk of gradation” due to the looming danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the defense sector
On Monday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up to Congress when he warned that automatic budget cuts would inadvertently weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to Afghanistan’s war zones and civilian flowbands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress is unable to finalize spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Department,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which would lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
“Such a high cut, carried out in such an unthinking manner, would render most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building — and seriously harm other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a majority of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with a bounding probability to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were ultimately made to combat troops," Panetta said.
“While the wartime contingents in the anti-terror fight are not directly affected by the confiscation, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort,” Panetta warned.
"Personnel settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the hiring supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a Department of Defense confiscation would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be permitted.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly voiced the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a grim picture of what might be ahead — a military with a shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
“It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon.
"It's a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to take it up with potential adversaries."
“It makes you really angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions create “significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global capability to deploy and intervene, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it’s an important next step to refueling so that potential dangers can be banished by China and other adversaries.
How to expose a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how dangerous and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering allegations of sexual harassment by several women, and both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's management is accused of mein edging out reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about foaming in school and during college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the test answers so that they can perform well in their own performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies are considered to be lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as sharades, in which the goal is to call out "Have you!", the defamation of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at reputable universities that specialize in the field of psychology and carried out far-reaching research projects.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lie have been uncovered.
Lies look you in the eye.
They do not always stutter, stammer, blush and squeak.
However, one cannot conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, which fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years researching the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of deworming. And it is clear that deworming a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us navigate our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing individuals or negotiating or administrating belong to one’s own vocation.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to spot “self-oriented” lies than women, whose lies are more “oriented toward others” – usually they want to protect the feelings of others – that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people are to lie to them (above all).
We also know that when a person has been exposed as a criminal, others feel less guilty about having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone is usually tripping with their foot constantly so that they don’t falsely accuse him of tripping with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of a disfigurement.
People who cheat may freeze when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point toward the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation and change in posture are all questions if they have.
Questioners often mistakenly signal that a job interview is over, only to keep an eye on the job interview after this relaxation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson’s slipper is famous for using the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceitful people can also use a different language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer becomes more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells scream.
There is no magic bullet to defuse lies, but you can learn skills that make defecation possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of scammers less often, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revised After Risk Due to Delayed U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, it is the pipeline-building companies that are trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different trajectory.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed to avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Foreign Ministry may delay a decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared in a written statement last week that the decision was a foreign ministry task and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ environmental impact has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle got a heart attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that scared her little daughter so much that she gave herself up for fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her Riverside Boulevard building.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
“Someone appeared behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and went to take her back on her arm,” she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter down near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She became angry and began to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would be hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the child’s mother said.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained from her escort and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family apologized in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for comment.
The lawsuit alleges an unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he does not charge a fee and plans the family to donate the money they receive to child cancer relief.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put against a kindergartener who carries an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change is slowing down the economy
In the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labor rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised high hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic adversities, growth can not be the main indicator, but on the contrary, the important indicator can be worse.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the amount of millions in agriculture, but also put close limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity in the first quarter of the year by 3.6 percent. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which is broadly based on economic growth.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November69 in the Mexican state has caused unemployment to rise continuously. The Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geograf<0xC3><0xAD>a has observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which is 4.53 percent of the working population.
Less liquidity
The economic scientist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), comments that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of cuts in funds through legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who prohibitively accumulate dollars, it is not easy to use them," he said.
The migration stopped.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult, given the high share of black work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 per cent of the country’s workers who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black labor are the lowest in Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Governmental Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September; this is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011. According to the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Econom<0xC3><0xAD>a (State Economic Authority), the FDI amounted to $630,597 from January to June, a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143 million in the previous year.
The Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government, for its part, recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan in the amount of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The state Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, however, until November could not establish a positive effect of the debt on any economic debt.
Reactions
The first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdé’s rule made the incapacity of the government obvious to the representatives of the entrepreneurship.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, President of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (State Chamber of Processing Industries in Mexico), stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to work twice as hard. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the economic development of the country more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy that is not moving sufficiently to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year well below our expectations",
Redefining the call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic (Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Coparmex chairman stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government’s efforts in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively, what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that a lot of work is still ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana intended for trade -.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military officers during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez street opposite guard post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the punishment is still in the execution facility.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Habitat, Rescue de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The head of the city's social development agency said that although the construction programs have already progressed, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell on the state. So far, only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they should have paid us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why at the beginning of his reign the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million, which is the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs went on and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not spent to participate in these programs," he said.
Even if the state authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition from analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, must be postponed due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality, thus the law remains in force.
In the draft for the lawsuit prepared by the Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree of law unconstitutional, since for the regulations concerning radio and television the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the law is the principe.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree of law. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero no longer applied the decree of law and ceased all activities for the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action submitted by the Chamber of Deputies, without taking part in the debate on the project, for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if you do that, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also reminded that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible, because it directs the state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, is a postponement of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, namely the government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government intervened in the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree of law, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not counted yet.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballots this year is a reality in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminaries (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor’s elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not counted yet.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just on November 9, the polling station had adopted a number of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice adapted to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not come into force in this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the state register within the deadlines provided for by the Argument.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and judged the state representative’s vote on the constitutional reforms to be “invalid and illegal” as he had no right to “decide or veto it”.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not coincide; the minutes of the vote counting and calculation are not available on file, or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee, or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the ballots filled out can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one who is in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, the second of which is mentioned.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate would have been excluded from the second choice.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés landed on Saltillo, his birthplace, on Sunday evening, and on Monday the funeral and a mass took place.
According to family members, the Lieutenant Colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane, the next person to take part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the funeral hall, which is located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, and where family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was led by his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio belonged to during his preparation for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to join the Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even dizzy him on a truck, yet he always aspired to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A final farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honors as Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez. His honors were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, school principals and students of Salum's education.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew crashed, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were sitting.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the front of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother-in-law, and his uncles, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots to different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event took place at the 1.5 kilometer point of the country road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Just a few feet away was another person’s body with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another place, as no bullet casings were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition, several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, initially on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros, eight people were arrested and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and those arrested confirmed they were members of the Los Zetas criminal group.
On November 12, at 06.00 am, on their patrol in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, military officers found a car without license plates with two inmates.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who at the sight of the military tried to take the escape.
They are charged with covert burials in the towns of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government, which will face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government, which will face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with political parties on government formation.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by Europoliticians to regain the strained confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti in a hurry was further compounded by the fluctuating market situation, which put interest rates on Italian government bonds at 7 per cent for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are destined to produce good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government composed mostly of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also exerts pressure.
On Monday, Monti began his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
The session will be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short respite towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would step down, as a result of the uncertainty over the new prime minister’s success, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a state debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns given the procedure imposed by pressure from financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on their hands.
From the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called 50 games behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly game that takes place today at 15:05 in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-color team has only defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico players, on the other hand, have few international meetings within the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a draw with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 overseas games.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will set a new record of 127 overseas games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder from Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approaches the number one spot with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are left winger J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
There are less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest are not even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, Costa Rica's V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not had their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream would come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, it's such a beautiful country that we're sure to stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry for taking so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a bit of pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve put on in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and are passionate about the jungle, making Costa Rica one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are the excellent areas for surfing. This way, about people who love surfing, we learned about it.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we are going to play is not an easy one.
If we record two or three songs that we haven’t played in a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that none of us imagined ever playing in a great rock band, and that for over 20 years, and that seems like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited to make music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to actively participate in the grunge’s birth?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being alive and that we care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One of us trusts the other and his music, and we couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with fame hasn’t always been easy, but thanks to your success, you were always able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. That has never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to talk about music, to work, and to talk about the music.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
of so many+
The first ones I think of include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bass players I like all afternoon.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don’t feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. Even though they are still important today, I think it’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why? Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed play them, they're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, when you lose a family member or a friend – it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several ailments, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl<0xC3><0xA1>sicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight, in addition to other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Direcci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policies between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, and since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the concretisation of tax information exchange agreements to remove them from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 'grey list', which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cord-bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to the stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, with which it is possible to play without a special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game to be developed for this console from the very beginning", because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesperson stressed that while it’s three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to catch the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles, without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest releases: The must-have installer must overcome platforms spiked with danger to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would allow former governor Alfonso Portillo to be extradited to the United States to be responsible for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
The trial for the US request for Portillo’s extradition ends, so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision grounds the independence of judiciary and government taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he had not interfered in court decisions and had allowed all extradition requests he had been informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms procedure is an act of government, which takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, which preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was set up to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former Fabra i Coats factory buildings, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems that were threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous managers of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association for these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in election campaigns proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work Office of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far “is a good foundation.”
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model who knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house, in which giant parties were held, was evacuated
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants of the house left the building yesterday afternoon without having resisted.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied yesterday afternoon, where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to desperation. The eviction was carried out on a court order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housewives made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been shown by the neighbors due to disturbance of rest, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the house occupants and in particular from the guests of the parties organized there, and which according to the statements of the angry neighbors became more and more prolonged in recent weeks.
The head of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had demanded that the building be removed immediately and that the problems of civic coexistence and the downfall of the district be brought under control.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that in recent months the occupants had penetrated into all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had been watching four people trying to break into the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its mockery on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became, in the eyes of many, the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (seas).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The Central Park was no longer a model, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, it was when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone is planning to set goals for the country.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can use.
And it is precisely this fact that offers the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n "it is necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast about the "front of the mountains", insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which is about the green apples, has not been carried out.
“One should assume that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the title “Gates of Collserola” contains a “lexical trap”: one may not “imagine it as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas where it is necessary to trade.”
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that comes with the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one’s own limitation to what can be built.
“Limiting something always means setting the next step,” i.e. exceeding it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [relating to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simply that the side of Collserola, which is heading towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not heading towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "fall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guiding letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the established multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the bidding conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: "There were 16 competitions advertised in cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountain-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, has led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length is equipped so that a soft transition between the city and green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red released the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process, which is being conducted against him because of alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after being pardoned by the authorized representative of the Casino Red before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is conducting the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of Casino Red, posted a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the sentencing, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the panic mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained at this location for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued, after the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the prison in Cadereyta, where he allegedly bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but stayed only a few hours in the middle security area, as murder threats were made against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza city prison.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, handed him an arrest warrant, stating that, after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was presented to convict Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house, in order to counter this.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to pass the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had expressed his forgiveness, but the lawyer held back the name.
In accordance with case 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is given a free speech. In the following, no objections can be filed against the process, in addition, no compensation is required.
After hearing the Commissioner of the betting house around 15.50, Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, went to the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza city prison to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been acquitted and that his case would be put on file.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come announced details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed indicate that the helicopter with its whole intact structure could be directly hit against the ground without the pilot having an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"No aircraft parts were found elsewhere in the search, the charge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the test results as soon as possible, but these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidential had flown at a cruising speed and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account during the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexican state, some deep-hanging clouds pulled up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that due to the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Point of impact:
The collision coordinates and the helicopter's last radar record are identical, and there may have been no loss of control of the aircraft or deviation from the flight path prior to the collision.
Dispersion of the remnants of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was bumped from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered remnants of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter with its undamaged structure was bumped to the ground.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer at the accident site do not close to fire or explosion.
The latest research results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is bulky and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure had crashed into the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
Mexico’s Social Security Institute is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Unidad de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and has continued since October 8 at the sports ground of Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and be completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and under the supervision of their parents.
You will also be asked questions about your physical activity and your family history of disease in order to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further concluded that on the aforementioned Saturdays, the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), controlled their blood pressure and determined blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Also, obesity had increased dramatically," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) taken from us, so that this is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the road surface were to be heeded, it would not be necessary to reduce nearly 200,000 impact holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City of the Valley of Mexico) erupts, said Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who was investigating the breach.
In his lecture "Technical Impact Holes", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of bumps.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the road surface its characteristic tensile behavior.
The tensile elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very tensile and at 50° C. it becomes almost solid, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers was a layer of asphalt, which consisted of small, asphalt-clad and then solidified stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
“If there were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed,” said the chemical engineer.
"A last layer, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt, is laid out over the wear layer," he said.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
The one that receives and distributes most of the forces of this road surface, the support layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material of which it consists must be maintained.
Weather conditions, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to consider, especially water, "he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates into the layer and only comes out difficult again. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of bumps.
When a punch hole is created, he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets its 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for standing on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the band she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took the crown and the cedar, the department comes already to 14 mistitels (1989), Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown.
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the downfall of a great favorite, who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown with the Miss Kolumb.
The first factor considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she had not convinced her of the answer to the question "Which book influenced you the most and why?", which had been put to her by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it’s a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I think the book that most shaped my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading Debt and Atonement. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called Passions.
A response that met with little reluctance, firstly because of the concept of ‘civilizing’ and secondly because she had not explained in detail how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony concluded, Melina explained feeling calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it’s happening what needs to happen.
And for all the people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had received all the accolades and all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous of the king, which could not have kept the stress on her."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she certainly performed with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not become queen after all".
In addition, at the end of the press Valle went out of his way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which was noted to her in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for <0x60>natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible body.
The Queen’s coach, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, “but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me was honestly barely noticeable, pushed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong suit, and this place she had to pay for."
Because of this award, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to let her get into the pleasure of the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina is entering her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the nomination of the National Beauty Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a lophoscopist of the Public Prosecutor’s Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Forzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez was on standby this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigation proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3> communities, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, after Valle, he settled over and after completing the required courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of the match against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the world's oldest guerrillas might be one, so he had to take with him the ten-finger print of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the examiner, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the imprint sheet.
It was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
In Search of Traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many criminals present false identification papers or they have none.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in case of theft, he had to tear a piece of wall from a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand exactly at this point, when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of liquor.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is connected with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that "fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to carry them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the personnel office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID cards,” the CTI expert explained.
He said that not everything is the way it would be portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The “Emperors” are challenging the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of them complied with the evacuation order and changed their location to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday, when they tried again with a court order to enter Manhattan Square after being evicted from the square in the early hours of the morning and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "imperators" the re-tentive tents at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement kept to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “imperators” to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and approving the protesters to the tent.
In addition, the "Emperors" occupied a new park located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can not give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have found themselves at this point, where also a delegation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which is to analyze the legality of the eviction that took place in the early hours of the morning.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried and distributed photocopies of this court order, even giving them to some police officers guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, which indicated that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as applying "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this court order had resulted in the reopening of the square to the public and the protesters, and he pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves in this place with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square, which was carried out in the early hours of the morning, in which almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the square because it had "become a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not the interests of North American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing "major actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months since the protests began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson is on the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1 on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model on a Canadian television Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe the life of a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-directed porn, in which she appears together with her ex-husband, the drummer of "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene appears Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as a Jesus child.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, during one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had called North American Kim Kardashian a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan has experienced since World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September helped to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the rate calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the machine sales for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real upheaval of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian shocks, which use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and gloomy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that loads like a tombstone into the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen’s listing.
While markets continue to overwhelm peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brakes would be pulled on the biggest economic potentials.
It dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average of 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures would be passed, but conservatives won’t sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of peripheral countries and growing uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being substantiated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days scheduled for his appointment in February may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will support the new austerity measures and will not delay any new elections.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras’s statement does not dispel doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else.”
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, making it clear that he would not endorse a commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreou’s referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties “did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible”.
Ministry of Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said Troika inspectors were coming back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "which would be "deadlined for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knuckle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has become the world's second donor to this instrument of international cooperation, whose "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in people."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Small Loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "especially the goal of reaching the number of people".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", remarked Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions emanating from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be "guaranteeing the creation of new capacities and better opportunities" for women in particular.
“We’ve had a lot of success” and “we’re facing a lot of challenges.”
The Summit on Small Loans is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to promote "two fundamental goals".
By the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services, and 10 million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of small loans in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this funding instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have been able to observe a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project explained to her yesterday the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "defender" of the arm.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that small loans were a "serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised countries now "more than ever" had to work according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "reveals the sun's gates".
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Union on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig passed for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who regard the government's policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's Presidency proposal, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, and ten abstained.
The standing ovation that lasted several minutes, which was initially Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble a few hours later due to their intervention, left no doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the proposal - carries the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Lisbon Treaty to the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, reinforcing the control of the European Union, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote, 'to give Europe a face'.
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly included Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble Pate.
Surely it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB’s Governing Council according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer tried to win over her congress at the expense of the "little" or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European request devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France to the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in the case of medical reports?
After the family aid, UMP and the government are now attacking the health reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family aid fund and present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is monitoring the introduction of a fourth day of absence before taking into account a sick report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the salary of four days without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
According to the daily "Les Echos", a measure that threatens to provoke anger would, however, help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the one that went along with another measure of rather symbolic character: to grant state officials an unpaid leave in case of illness (there is no leave period for them, unlike the three leave days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also re-initiating the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence from work.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they must be reimbursed if this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 in front of the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of health reports seems a little disproportionate.
Indeed, this has been the subject of constant observation and political offensives since 2002, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first dwell on the country-wide figures.
According to the state health fund CNAM, in 2006 more than 237 million euros in daily payments were paid.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health Care, the daily outlays in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion, accounting for 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% of sick leave, which amounted to EUR 6.2 billion.
That’s 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were allowed an average of only 14.5 sick days.
An average that obscures some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers indicated they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time recorded by the health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the health reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% were between 15 days and a month, 15% were between one and three months and 11% were over.
Compared to their European neighbours, the French workers are therefore no more likely than elsewhere to become incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (due to illness or other reasons) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 16% in the UK.
Fraud in sick leave accounts for a vanishingly small proportion of black work.
With regard to the fraud, only a weak estimate is reached here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks in case of sick leave exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College of Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found, under 1.5 million controls, that 13% of the 285,000 short-term health reports made, which is hot in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the case of systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days duration, there were less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have filed a sick report.
A number that represents only a weak dimension compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to catch up with its economy.
This had been announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners as well as a new programme for budgetary adjustment," the head of government said in his first public address at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote of Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the Eurozone was "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country's national deficit "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights Reject the New Spam Measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent ahead that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a congress of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary responsibilities entrusted to the EU Commissioner, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of over 8 billion euros without written guarantee of all parties over their support of the planned measures, had replied that his word was enough and he would not be under pressure from Auven.
Euthanasia and Accompanied Free Death Must Be Legalized, Says Expert Panel
Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions, and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers, and beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a state of refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, interlinked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent EIU society, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe with each other.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of these eventually die in hospital.
Across the country, the rate of hospital-acquired deaths in Quebec is the highest at 86%.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already advocated no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts who similarly inspected all those countries whose approach legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would be a misuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or unaccompanied suicide.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Accompanied suicide is also practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia.
Let us recall that, according to a 2010 Angus horse survey, 85% of Canadians had already advocated euthanasia because they believe it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to the people who have already committed an accompanying suicide, the respondents are 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As for the maintenance or adjustment of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their recommendation list that the criminal law should state that the disposal of funds for which a valid refusal has been made should not be considered criminal.
The expert panel also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life provision of funds, without having to fear prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions, and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatments to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the pain-relieving or life-affirming measures already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions, the panel calls for consideration, at least, since these, like euthanasia, were not used to reduce physical pain, and they were used without the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some experts in the field of health care law have already raised reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, "extreme", since this does not set any limits to the euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
“This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility above all other values involved in the social work of society.
Now, he says, there are “guidelines and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the report's conclusions, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly questions the reports regarding the non-existence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus has launched a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, who, however, thanks to the support of Russia and a "conspiracy" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the expulsion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, even though Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, had taken a position in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the acting Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his authority in Syria", in which already around forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Baschar were at the heart of his country's interest, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation efforts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go," he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is increasingly harsh.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have made an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government power in the Dar'a region of southern Syria were killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two more civilians were killed in “firefights and heavy bombings around Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless believed that the country was “taxing towards the end of the crisis”.
By the way, he has reacted with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which in his opinion represents a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in", he added under the assurance that "conspiracies forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression of what he called his “paranoia”.
An extraordinary new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the escalation of the crisis, which was adopted on November 2, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision yesterday “incorrect” in order to avoid advocating possible sanctions on Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has taken a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that “demands sacrifice” in order to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of Berlusconi’s government.
The former EU commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to call a cabinet into parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
“Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the current President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, had been waiting for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The talks will culminate in the presentation of a list of resignations presented by Mr Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock and bond markets demanded their time.
In “a democracy, there are certain deadlines” to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is “certain that the markets will be patient and understanding”.
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The incumbent prime minister was supposed to found a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians" as well.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of the parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his duties, Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently towards the goal of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the Italian economy even taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balancing the budget in 2013, despite the austerity plans it has embarked on in recent months, has in particular requested new austerity measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, the head of Italy's "heads" who will meet on Tuesday on Monti, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, "because a country that has no growth to show, which can not respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "era change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has 200 billion euros in government bonds until April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-capable explosive device, a US-based nuclear risk NGO confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as other documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the early 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to found a company in Kiev that manufactures nano-diamonds.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only highly skilled in this technique, but also, as a member of the agency reported, his entire professional career has been directly influenced by this technology."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims rose by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to FBI statistics released on Monday, either declined slightly or increased only slightly over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violent acts against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes committed.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 in very weak cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed. "The increase in anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s head.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these abuses,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police attitudes toward “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" presents itself in American federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is becoming more and more like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitter" users, the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, whether they are subscribing to new posts, favoring certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested "at a low percentage of users" before its general Internet distribution on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat esotericly suggestive wording (RT zum referenzierten Wiederkochen des Beitrages einer Personen). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the networks general public Facebook and Google+.
Users on the network discussed this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook,” @jemb123 writes.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
Austria’s ruling government of the grand Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition decided on Tuesday to incorporate a “Golden Budget Rule” into the constitution to reduce public deficits and also to address a possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria’s top-ranked A.A.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision to exit the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the level of debt of the countries like Italy, and Spain.
“If Austria’s ability to pay was not reduced by a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year,” argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria is also calling for a Brussels summit of eurozone member states on 26 October: the heads of state and government then demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to public account balance in the constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The measure adopted by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again in the currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"If we determine an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, "we will intervene just as we did last time," Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again nearing the historic levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which is about to hit a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen steadily over this, doped by purchases by investors who see the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
“Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region of the Northeast,” said Noda, who fears that the yen’s price tag could kill the weak recovery already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year, thanks to the jump in export growth and consumption of households "plumbed" by the disaster, the third world economic power has once again gained traction.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the yen’s price tag does not reflect “Japan’s economic foundations.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to de-energize the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, said the BoJ had already initiated "appropriate measures" to make it clear that no additional monetary easing would be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) to offset the 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to overwhelm the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates rise quickly, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, are drifting even further into negative areas on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to new tensions over government bond yields in the troubled Eurozone, global equity markets are continuing to release some of their recent gains.
“Capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from renewed fears from market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a decline of 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro zone is damaging the single currency, which will continue its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it dropped by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it fell after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, had approved a request that, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to exit the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Loan interest rates in Italy and Spain continue to be at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% on 10 years, that of the Spanish stock matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets, as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expected growth figures for the euro area
Statistically speaking, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economic experts.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first euro-area-wide recount is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the risk of another recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or due to emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the totality of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing for a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, not a huge proportion of the world’s population should have to dispense with a vital element.
At the same time, we must mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a sustained basis, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a theme that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate imbalances.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision on the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided after Fukushima to join another unit in its park by reactivating the plant Three Mile Island, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as a model, the reality, however, contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, in particular on Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is on the one hand a European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the energy price plays a key role in competitiveness in the globalised economy as well as a key pillar of industry's stability on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore entail a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are willing to pay just as little as they show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to withdraw from nuclear power, it would fall victim to a majority of these SMEs, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for sixty years if its producer’s demise was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is as little of a miracle agent to produce electricity as there is a devil’s work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are obsessed with the idea of safety.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction as well as inexorable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn as much from this accident as it did from the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft that allows it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, leaving them free track to seize the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development itself.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles – overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the official side had shaped the weekly shows, the interior minister had casually (see Libération of May 23) announced that France "did not need talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "cannot absorb the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of roughness.
The fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of rudeness one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande restricts himself in his programme to banalities, which point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work, Einwirtschaftsw<0xC3><0xA4>ndig, summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), a broad consensus exists among the
Restricting immigration would depress growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the domestic workforce, especially the less qualified, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage-earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unencumbered.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract native wage earners, the more skilled among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not commensurate with employment.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in the migrant flood would result in an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants is conducive to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high percentage of immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, averaging about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labor Organization estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will contribute to the public budget on average over his or her lifetime a net contribution (income minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros.
At the start of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth".
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable commodity; it is also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, according to their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece pass over.
Some had believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, in order to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, an education, an economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change in attitude of the Greek Truth and False Referendum would have had a doubly revealing character in this regard: on the one hand, the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be regarded as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pushing for a success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European sole ruler or a leap with blindfolded eyes into the void of nationalist retreat: a grand choice for the citizen!
No, we want a hacksaw, but a collective task, rightfully so, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the list, by the way - as there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the hands of popular sovereignty.
This is because it is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and build a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that they cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has been long fought over by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is pushing the European economic leadership to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it aspires to the citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching continues to be valid.
We need to build a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general goods
The World Fair for Chip Cards opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most load-bearing segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, this year 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments, after a long period of lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two large French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out bank cards with contactless chips to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
A vanishingly small percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They've fallen into delay".
"But at least next year they should experience a real upward development."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it was preparing the launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless by mobile phone.
The terrorist front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspicious relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty" about this.
"The way in which the two organizations operate, as well as the relations between the intelligence services, indicate clear cooperation," he said without going into further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
Investigations into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have revealed the existence of interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, were reportedly killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the site of the operation.
Anti-Terrorist
The analysis of the conducted telephone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian man who had been staying for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
“But it is conceivable.”
“It has been known for years that the sect has been receiving financial and intellectual support from Auven and that it is becoming increasingly active,” says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as have the speeches and modes of operation of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide bombers as well as the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with at Washington, has since then exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati that does not need to be given special attention.
Quick success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicises itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their increased attacks on the police stations.
However, Abuja’s reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken into captivity, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide attack that took place in the secure Abuja police headquarters - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since worried all security experts.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria of Boko Harem and was ready to "communicate all indications".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like that, the voters could almost get that impression.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-conspirators have repeatedly released their thunderous statements and statements regarding Auven politics, a traditional Republican focus.
Slogans fall on China, Iran and Israel’s aid – often in no way substantiated.
Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking “Grand Old Party” nominee, threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of “currency manipulation” – a leading issue in an America that is most irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
“It’s stupid to think that this would imply the initiation of a trade war,” he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost taken his breath away with regard to his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not being listened to, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Equinox
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran in the event of sanctions to stop the nuclear program failing.
“If I am elected, I am ordering Iran to stop,” he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb".
In addition, he has promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner’s obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-ranked candidate, for his part, shows a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear weapon" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is voicing his willingness to enlist the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Against the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as anti-terror was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive twinning with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not quite so unforced.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to impeachment.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with brilliance and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sounding and at the gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically jointly turned the tax on the valve that carries Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km long, connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas – the equivalent of France’s total consumption – is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line on the same track is already being sounded.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: for them it will now become more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily involved in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a de-energisation of European energy, as the project has hit a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in implementing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin numerous with regard to the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete casing, which is supposed to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 m.
When it was built, it had to be removed from minefields dating back to the Second World War.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed for precautionary purposes," said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, reinforced measures to protect the fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long metal line, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from doing so, as the Swedes had little desire to see a Russian state-owned company settle permanently at the level of its coasts.
"In the event of a crash, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas line thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams have been estimated to have a leak resistance of one per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing ship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas line was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the pipeline remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (each at 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group GDF Suez (each at 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on an extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas actually transported is," M<0xC3><0xBC>ller said.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders as well as to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are anxious to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline is located on a sandy, pine-wooded stretch of coast near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other metrics of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give new style to writing.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight hours spent writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, as aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook as we know it today, however, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to bring a distinguished design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, at the time a specialist consultant for the company, is in charge of the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a long-established production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton lacquer used, for example, for upholstery covers.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
“We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which persist despite the rise of e-mails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a leopard print cover.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is always twice the average: 19% versus 9% unemployment of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No," said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Association Adapt, which organizes the "Week of Work for the Disabled."
“The progress made in 15 years is significant.”
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
“However, there is still a lot to be done.”
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed people, numerous obstacles persist before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a degree and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of disabled people compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it harder to get back to work and that are the “core of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which certainly, but slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the managers interviewed have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people" who are "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually impaired".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last-named figures from 2008 refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization that is tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof: The number of "fees paying" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge, especially among the large corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the facilities between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard:"What a fortune"
Even before they gave their heads to the Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed the pleasure that brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look ahead," the native Liller assures him.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in Club and Nationalelf "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has led the French national team since he was 7 years old, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been supported,” he said.
This necessarily helps to reinforce even more the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just ran across the road".
"To be allowed to play against them means great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, had "pride" ring with kindness.
"The pride of playing a gala match".
"Pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbor" - that France "has become a team again at a very high level", and this little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc did a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician looks very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national elf) ... and to Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out roughly," he stressed.
"We're planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the setback against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked materiality in the playoffs.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, in fact, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Considering the playoff (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the matter on the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk, as we haven't reached an outward gate."
At home, however, in their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to break through in front of an audience that is equally as keen on the game, even if the game has of course been announced as "very tight", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being in the European Championship in 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
An indecision can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
“This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, because we have not reached an outward gate,” said Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have preferred to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the very beginning, in order "to give them no time to think".
A good idea, on the condition that it is implemented this time.
